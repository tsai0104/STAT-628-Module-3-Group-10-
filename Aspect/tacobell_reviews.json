After being back I started to feel weird. I actually thought I was on LSD (don't ask how i know).\n\nI made my way down to my friend and when I reached his office my other co-worker was there talking to him. I didn't say any thing when one of them said, \"you feeling funny too?\"\n\n\"Yep... I feel really whacked out\"\n\nNeedless to say we thought we had food poisoning and we called in to Taco Bell's hot line and to make a long story short, they ignored our complaint.\n\nSo I put in a call to the county to have the health inspector go out there but it took them four weeks to go out and inspect the place. Big help that was.\n\nTo this day I don't know what happened to us.

Well, maybe not concern- she laughed and said \"your ass will be on fire!\"\n\nNo worries.  There are three of these spicy things, which are basically small burritos.  Flour tortilla, beans, a little meat, and tortilla strips.  Mild is chipotle, medium (\"you're getting hotter,\" it says) is habanero, and hot (\"you're on fire!\") is ghost pepper. \n\nI started with a bite of the chipotle as a baseline, and saved most to use as a palate cleanser for the others.

I have gave it a year to get better but it literally can not get any worse. I run a business that is not 100 yards from this taco bell and it is a fast paced business where me and my employees need to eat fast, or at least get our food in a reasonable amount of time. I would say 5 minutes from order would be reasonable.  This does not happen here.  I have been caught in the drive thru for over 45 minutes (no exaggeration) and today took the cake.  I should have learned my lesson, but I pulled in and saw the drive thru line was overflowing...poor souls.. I parked and went inside to an empty dining room. I ordered my food.  I went to use the bathroom and im not kidding, the urinal AND the toilet were overflowing, water all over the floor. The employee said they knew about it for awhile, but were too busy to handle it.  I wish I could send a pic. There were poop pieces in the hallway to the eating area.  As I was waiting for my food there was a traffic jam outside where people were trying to reverse out of the drive thru line, people were coming inside and asking for money back, an elderly man ordered just before me and he ordered ONE BURRITO SUPREME and I got my order before him which was an order for 2 people.  It seems that the business owner has done nothing to help the situation. I don't understand as if it was my business I would make sure I watched social media and also had a finger on the pulse of my business! I ordered my food per my receipt at 5pm and I just got to my work next door at 530.  Fortunately this was a little faster than normal.  They informed me they were out of Baja blast, then the guy who ordered after me they told they were out of dr pepper. There were over 20 receipts on the counter top by the register all spread out where people had got their food and just left them there to blow all over. I could see the kitchen and there was a nacho on the floor, and countless pieces of garbage all over.  I have reasonable expectations from a fast food joint, but this place is so bad I cant believe it. I feel bad for the kids working there. They have no direction. Its like their parents have gone out of town and they are trying to run a business. Someone HAS to get this place under control.

At first we were dismissed being told that we had to pay first before the order would go through their system as however when we showed physical proof of the review we received at the counter (we paid in cash and could only do so from the counter) we were still treated with indifference.

I'm over it. \n\nTonight, when my boyfriend arrived home with Taco Bell, we pulled everything out of the bag only to discover that they forgot our second Mexican pizza.   He immediately called and then drove the 15 minutes back there to get the other item. As he was on his way home for the second time I called him to tell him that I went to take a bite of my Mexican pizza and was surprised to find a bug clearly cooked on it. I even snapped a pic and sent it to him. I'm so glad I saw the bug before I took any bite. I didn't eat my meal at all. Unfortunately my boyfriend wasn't as lucky as he ate one of his Gordita crunches on the way back to pick up the forgotten Mexican pizza. Had I called him a couple of minutes sooner with my discovery he would not have ate his Gordita. \n\nSo he came home grabbed the food and drove back for the THIRD time and went to return the food. Again, we retuned all of the meal minus a Gordita, that he wouldn't have ate if he knew about the bug earlier. So that's 4 of the 5 items returned. Basically the full meal. They wouldn't give the refund and actually argued with him about wanting the refund for the meal that we weren't going to eat. \n\nI get that it could have been a genuine accident. A bug in the food is gross, accident or not and I am not eating food with a bug in it. The fact that this location ALWAYS messes up every single order and now we get an order with a bug in it?

It's a combination restaurant in partnership with KFC, which is probably a big part of the problem. Either the chicken is amazing, and the Taco Bell side is slipping through the cracks, or they both are going down the tubes. \n\nI went here with an Uber after work one day through the drive thru. The driver and I both thought that would be faster than going inside. Mind you, there was no one in the drive thru line in front of us, nor were there any customers even inside. It was completely dead. \n\nWe still somehow managed to wait a good 15 minutes for everything after paying, and for what? Please, see my pictures. The quality was not there at all. I was not expecting gourmet, but I could've done better for sure. There was no care or concern put into my meal. The crunchwrap was barely sealed and falling apart with old grilled bits stuck to the bottom. You know, the kind where the grill isn't cleaned often, so you get all that old charcoal taste on it. On top of that, the taco salad shell was served completely broken and with toppings stuck to the top as it was mushed down too tightly when the cover was closed. \n\nI ordered some tacos on the side which were okay, but the other items were unacceptable. There are people who would love to have a job right now during this pandemic, and it just saddens me when I see people serve food with no care like that.

Lots of smiles and positive attitudes which truly impressed me.  \n\nGive this location a try when you are ready to think outside the bun and go south of the border!", "date": "2018-05-12 18:19:25"}, {"review_id": "WIgGgcSM9Jh8RwXAzgZrNw", "user_id": "_rXdF2qBCiJiReLBBCuLKA", "business_id": "jAVDzb0ZbxraegZAC2YetQ", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 7, "funny": 8, "cool": 2, "text": "I just had a 29 minute experience at the drive-thru.  29 minutes.\nAnd if THAT had been my only problem, I'd give this place a glowing review.\n\nI pulled into the drive-thru at 11:41 PM.  There was one car in front of me waiting to order, and one car at the pick-up window.\nAround 11:48 PM, the car in front of me finally placed their order and moved up to the pickup window.  \nI finally got my order placed at 11:56 PM.  (That whole time, I just sat there in silence - I was never once greeted, or told that they'd be right with me, or anything like that.)\n\nMy order:\n2 Cheesy Potato Burritos (with Chicken instead of Beef)\n1 Cheesy Potato Burrito (with Steak instead of Beef)\n1 side of nachos with cheese\n1 Large \"Limeade Sparkler\"\n\nI pulled forward and waited behind the other car (the one who had finished placing their order 8 minutes before me).  Eventually it was my turn to pull up to the window.  The guy handed me my drink.  Unfortunately, it seemed that most of the drink was on the outside of the cup.  The indented lid was covered with liquid, all of which spilled on me when I took the drink into my car, and the outside of the cup was soaking wet and sticky.  Delightful.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later, another employee came to the window and handed me two bags.  \"Here's your order\" (handed me one bag) \"...and here's your steak burrito.\"  (handed me another bag.  Ok,, that was weird, but whatever.  I wanted to pull away, so I tried to condense the bags.  Of course, as I drove off, I noticed that there were only 2 total burritos in the bag.  I turned around in the parking lot and looped back around to go back to the drive-thru - only to discover that there were now SIX cars lined up.  There was NO way I was waiting in that line.  So I pulled up alongside the car that was currently at the window.  The guys in that car were nice enough to tell the guy at the window that I was back, looking for the rest of my order.  \n\nEventually, the girl who handed me my order came skipping (yes, skipping) out to my car to see what I needed.  She asked to see my order.  I handed her the bag.  I don't want to say she was rude about it, but let's say that she seemed \"pretty sure of herself\" that I had, indeed, received everything correctly.  I watch in PURE HORROR as she (with bare hands) took one of the burritos out of the bag, UNWRAPPED IT (yes, in the middle of the parking lot - and yes, with bare hands) and said \"Here's the chicken one!\"  She then waved the other burrito in my face and said \"And here's the steak one!\"  It took a great deal of effort and patience on my part to remind her that I had ordered 2 chicken burritos and 1 steak.  She then asked to see my receipt, because she was \"sure that there was only 1 on the order\".\n\nShe then skipped back into the restaurant, and I returned to the waiting game.  Eventually someone else brought out the new burrito and handed it to me.  Not once did anyone apologize to me.  \n\nI left the drive-thru at 12:10, making that a 29 minute drive-thru experience.\n\nBUT, here's the best part...not only did I get dinner.... I got dinner AND a show!  In that wonderful 29 minute \"experience\", I was blessed enough to be visited by mother nature's littlest creatures, as I counted no less than 10 various mice and rats scurrying throughout the parking lot, and climbing along the ledges of the building.  Mmmm, tasty and appetizing, right?  \n\nAnd THAT isn't even the end of the story....\nI got home, and promptly threw out the first chicken burrito (the one that Susie Skipsalot opened with her bare hands in the middle of their rat infested parking lot)...\nBut, against my better judgement, I ate the rest of my items.\n\nThe order of nachos with cheese i ordered?  There were 8 (eight) nacho chips in there.  EIGHT.  Well, that's 8 plus enough shards and crumbs to possibly make a 9th chip.  The cheese sauce with them was cold, and rock hard.  One of the chips broke when I tried to dip it in the cheese.\n\nThe steak burrito tasted \"off\"... which was really disconcerting, considering the wildlife I witnessed in their parking lot.\n\nThe chicken burrito, however, was what really gave this meal a nice \"finish\".  About halfway through the burrito, I bit into something that didn't belong...  INSIDE my burrito was one of those plastic-wrapped cinnamon candies (the ones that look like the red and white peppermint candies).  Yes, a plastic wrapped candy INSIDE MY CHICKEN BURRITO.\n\nAlso, I asked for mild sauce, and got \"Fire\". \n\n\nI went on the Taco Bell website to try to contact them, but their webform is limited to 500 characters, which isn't nearly enough for me.  I tweeted them, asking for an email address, and they responded with a 1-800 number.  I responded again, asking for an email address, and they responded again with the 1-800 number.  So I guess if they're not willing to contact me the way that's most convenient for me, I'll just say \"screw it\" and put my story on Yelp.", "date": "2012-07-03 05:31:07"}, {"review_id": "R4oEO1uMXeQKs2Xje9ixIQ", "user_id": "o2OV7seA0YZLmcQ8H00bVQ", "business_id": "ygivVqLtI-JU2qdps4Vdfg", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "It sucks when you are craving something and you go and order food get home and the order is completely messed up even when is not rush hour!

So I ordered my food, kept my order small. And here is a HUGE tip to the other reviewers and our right: before driving off I Opened the sealed bag and checked my order. The food was fresh and put together as it was supposed to be. If there was an issue I'd kindly wait till they came back to the window and respectfully ask they fix the order. It truly is that simple.

It really depends on the time of day; if you come here during dinner service, you might want to drive to Orange City instead.\n\nWe made an online order on Friday, November 16. We arrived at 6:00PM and had our order finalized and in the system at about 6:10. Our niece came with us. She ordered hers at the counter. Her order was ready (although had items that were incorrect) at 6:06PM.  So around 6:36 PM and our food wasn't up yet, my wife asked the clerk what the hold up was, while I sat and watched our newborn. \n\nWe ordered:  3 value items for myself, and a chalupa box, NOTHING custom or complicated/special order. It should have been a very easy and quick to prepare order.\n\nWe both have low blood sugar, so the wait was already starting to make me nauseous.  During our wait, we witnessed a very loud worker complaining and about half a dozen disgruntled customers complaining about the wait and their order being wrong.\n\nAt first the clerk tried to make the excuse that we had to notify them at checkout we had an online order. I noticed what was really going on, in order to catch up on orders they were pushing the orders off the screen to focus on orders they could make quickly, until our order was completely pushed off the screen.\n\nSomewhere way after 7PM we finally got our food. At this point we could have went to Orange City and ordered food twice and eaten twice in the amount of time this order took to prepare.\n\nI really don't see going back there again anytime real soon. It is a shame too, this location is just around the block from us.\n\nSo if you really want to throw the dice in both order accuracy and service, then I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant - heck misewell keep it exciting right?!?  But if you want consistent service and accuracy, I suggest you skip this store all together, at least until they do some housecleaning or re-training. I really hope the manager reads this review.\n\nI don't make it a habit to complain, but this store was so bad it actually warranted me contacting corporate, which I try to never do.\n\nEDIT:\nJust a quick sidenote too, the drivethru is probably one of the worst ones I have EVER seen, thats why we park and order to go.

They told me the that could not process refunds because the only person that could do so was not at the restaurant and had to drive in from 20 mins away. There were three other groups waiting for food that somehow disappeared from the order processing system at the restaurant.\n\nThe situation got so bad that the \"manager\" threw his hands into the air, told an employee to lock the door and stop taking orders inside the restaurant, and then presumably went to his office. I did not see him again. This all happened at 7:30 pm, well before the dining room was to close.\n\nThe biggest issue I had was that this Taco Bell used to be efficient and hadn't messed up any of my orders in years. I liked the design of the interior and felt comfortable eating there. They have since redesigned the entire restaurant and it now is white, cold, and boring. The staff is all new and don't seem to care about their jobs or pleasing customers.

Let me start with some advice.\n\nI highly recommend that to enter the Taco Bell parking lot, you turn right at the street which, when heading north, is immediately before the Arby's.  Then take the first opportunity to turn left.  This puts you into the Arby's parking lot, but if you veer to the right you will be able to get into the Taco Bell parking lot - turn immediately to your left once on Taco Bell property to actually get into the ordering lane.  After you place your order, try to take the turn to the pick-up window slowly and carefully - they are about 10 feet short of the amount of space needed to let you get close to the window if you are at all sloppy.  After you pick up your food, proceed with tremendous caution, because people who tried to go into the Taco Bell parking lot through its only dedicated driveway will (potentially) be two seconds from running you down.\n\nAnd that's really why I can't give this Taco Bell more than three stars.  It's a bit of a logistical nightmare.  The service is decent - probably 80th percentile for all central Ohio Taco Bells.  There are almost always clean tables and recently attended-to soda fountains inside; the syrup-to-carbonated-water balance is rarely off by much if anything.  It looks like the place has been renovated in the last two or three years.  They almost never goof up on my somewhat picky order.  I would say that on those grounds, ignoring the logistical issues, this is one of my favorite Taco Bell locations (I am familiar with Taco Bell locations in six or seven states and have eaten at least fifteen or so in Ohio.)

Luckily enough for me, there's a Taco bell directly across the street, well within walking distance.\n\nNot that I walked there mind you, I was already about to eat Taco Bell for breakfast so I figured why not just go 2-0 for failure and drove the 100 feet.\n\nThe staff appeared busy, as if the concept of slapping eggs on a tortilla was somehow vastly different of a concept from slapping \"beans\" on a tortilla. I ordered a standard breakfast burrito; thinking that that would be utterly impossible to foul up, and a Steak A.M. Crunchwrap; thinking I hadn't had a stomach ache in at least a week so I was about due anyway. I opted not to get the coffee, because I have an abundance of terrible coffee at home, and frankly I have a Starbucks card.\n\nThe burrito was unremarkable at best. The eggs tasted real at least not like the soggy prison eggs you get in a high school cafeteria or Ikea, but it was bland. Fair warning, when I actually looked in the burrito as I was eating it, the sausage reminded me in size, shape, and color of rabbit pellets.\n\nThe first bite of the Steak A.M. Crunchwrap however, was another experience entirely, that thing was absolutely delicious. There was some type of tangy spicy sauce in there which blended perfectly with what was essentially a Denny's grandslam wedged tightly into a tortilla. Tempting fate, I once again dared to gaze into the depths of the now exposed Crunchwrap: the less that is said about that exposed alien brain the better. Lesson learned: don't look inside taco bell food, it's wrapped up for a reason.Despite its appearances, it was enjoyable down to the last bite.\n\nFinal Grade? 7/10, I would actually rate the Crunchwrap higher than a Mcgriddle but lower than the Steak Bagel Sandwich at McD's, nicely filling that bizarre craving for spicy food in the morning I get sometimes.", "date": "2014-05-12 23:11:33"}, {"review_id": "M00ZKMCnUdVShzi4JO5H7Q", "user_id": "Sp2GV7D-_JLZMPQmDanzPQ", "business_id": "_QFD8JKi7nNKZYiytBuUKg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 5, "funny": 2, "cool": 4, "text": "Wow am I really giving Taco Bell 5 stars!?

Aren't they all the same.  Yeah, well, that's the problem.  They aren't.  Let me explain.\n \nOne of the basic cornerstones of the fast food industry is that you can get a burger, burrito or fries at one location and know that it will taste like that at any other location in the country.  I get that, and for the most part approve.  But this particular location must have missed the memo, among a few other things.\n \nFirst off, you never know exactly what you're going to get when you order here.  I have ordered 3 chili cheese burritos and in the same bag received, a long thin burrito, a short, fat burrito and a little tiny burrito-ette that looked like the baby brother of the first two.  You can get a mexican pizza with red tomato abundantly covering the cheese or... once, I got 2 green tomato-like cubes.  And that was it.  Is there no manual on how to make the food here?  It should be at least a little consistent, shouldn't it?\n \nMy bigger complaint is that the prices here are 30 to 80 cents higher here than any other local Taco Bell location.   On the same weekend when my daughter was going through a chicken burrito phase, we stopped here and the chicken burrito was $1.59.  It was a $1.29 at the Polaris location.  The next weekend, at the TB on Morse road near Best Buy, another $1.29.  It's not like this location is on the beach or has a view of Niagara Falls.  I understand that some franchisees may price a little differently, but 23% more for the same item that often times is much smaller than other locations offer?\n \nWe only eat fast food maybe 2 or 3 times a month max.  So this review is more like a review of the 8 times we have been there in 2 years.  Plus there is a sliding scale on fast food places being reviewed.  I mean, how can I give any fast food place a four stars when there are really good restaurants that have a four star rating.  Probably the maximum for a fast food place in my opinion is 3 stars.  This location should get about 1.5 stars.  In honor of my last mexican pizza here that was covered with red tomato, I'll round up to 2 stars.

At the start of the pandemic we were really impressed with how quickly this location pivoted to contactless service.  And the service was quick and pleasant.\n\nOver the last two to three months service has gone downhill and almost all of our food orders have been wrong in some way.  Fast forward to this Sunday, we wanted to watch some football and thought we would try to use the coupon on the Uber app to keep us out of the crappy weather.\n\nThe problems begin when the Uber delivery driver takes a photo of the food and explains that the food was wrong but the Taco Bell wouldn't listen to him.  Two of our items were missing and all of the drinks were wrong, including we would find out when we tried them, substituting full sugar beverages instead of the requested diet ones.  Good thing none of us are diabetic.\n\nSo my wife calls, asks to speak with a manager and requests a solution.  Roy D (the only information he would provide) gets on the phone and says that we ordered it wrong.  My wife has the Uber order and the Taco Bell receipt that was taped to the bag in her hands and tells Roy that she's looking right at the order and receipt and they were both correct, exactly what we ordered and did not receive.  My wife asks to speak to his manager and Roy says that he is the general manager this Taco Bell location and he starts screaming at my wife that she ordered it wrong.  I can hear his voice from my wife's phone 20 feet away.\n\nIn sharing these types of experiences with others it seems like this is a growing trend.  When the pandemic first began, pick up food service seemed to pretty much step up and make things go as well as possible.  Now that we are 8 months in it seems like some fast food places have used \"drive-through-only\" to hide behind poor/ I don't a crap service.  They can screw up your order and when you get home or it's delivered and it's wrong, what can you do?  You can call the store and let Roy D scream at you.  Roy D knows that the doors to the Taco Bell are locked so you can't even enter the store and request that you receive what you paid for.  So congrats to \"Troll\" Roy D, you yelled at a female customer and hid behind your locked doors.  \n\nWe of course have escalated this to Taco Bell Corporate Office.  And we will be responding by not returning to Taco Bell so, ultimately we'll respond with our wallets.

Period. Don't go here. \n\nExtremely unfortunate that this is the only Taco Bell near campus. I have been to this location close to 2 dozen times, and can honestly say only on 2-3 of these occasions have I left slightly satisfied. \n\nThe closing times posted online? Apparently these don't matter and the employees close at whatever time they feel like. On 3 separate trips I have taken the time to walk to my car parked off campus, drive to this location, only to have them be closed well before their posted time.\n\nAlso, don't expect them to keep their dining room open even close to an appropriate time. I walked a mile to get some grub, and found all doors locked at 9:30 pm. Having already committed to this endeavor, I decide to try and walk through the drive thru in a final attempt to eat. After 15 mins of waiting in an excessive line (caused by the painfully slow speed of the restaurant to make your food), I walk up to the box only to be completely ignored.\n\nI wasn't informed I couldn't order, they didn't ask me to get out of line, they just sat there and ignored me. Are you ******* kidding me?\n\nThe day was saved when a car full of drunk patrons saw my struggle and invited me to get in and order with them. One of the more inebriated women in the back informed me it was her birthday, so decided to try and change my karma and purchase all of their food for them. \n\nAfter 2 hours and $35, I finally return to my residence, covered in a strangers vomit, eager to finally eat my assorted grillers and soft tacos. But of course, they messed up my order.\n\nSweet tea? They haven't changed it in 5 weeks currently, every time I order it at the window they give me a more and more watered down caramel colored liquid. I thought about saying something on multiple occasions but let's be pragmatic; what's the point.\n\n\nMy love for Taco Bell is the only thing that has kept me returning to this dreadful location. Perhaps I'm just a masochist, only explanation for why I would continue to subject myself to the atrocities of 2553 north high street. \nI do not plan on returning again. \nEver.\n\nGood riddance.", "date": "2016-12-13 18:50:19"}, {"review_id": "kNj06wk0WVjwwf4AZi52QA", "user_id": "Ehh_4N31CFNsr6RIMYop-w", "business_id": "ps5uyZwxwIf3X0AOiV4MzA", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I don't go to Taco Bell very often but the two times I've gone in the past few months have been rough.

We then called the manager back and explained how poor it was and refunded our money. And now today, we go back and order a taco pack with soft and hard some without lettuce and the order wasn't even close to right, there was taco meat outside the tacos spread all over the shell... Then we call the manager and explained we don't want a refund or to bring the food back but we would like him to speak with the staff and work on getting this correct and share our 3rd poor experience...

It just barely resembles something vaguely Tex-Mex, but chances are that if you managed to navigate to Yelp.com, you probably already know how you feel about Taco Bell food, so I'll spare you the mediocre, bland details.\n\nWhat makes this Taco Bell my favorite Taco Bell is quite simply all the character it has. It is very often during the school year absolutely swamped with business from all sorts of people- drunk students, nearby residents, motorcycle clubs, and a healthy attachment of police officers.\n\nWhen it gets that busy, it takes a while to get your food. This would normally be intolerable at anything that claims to be fast food, but when it's jumping here, it's really jumping. You might witness just about any kind of personality and any kind of interpersonal exchange in the window between ordering and getting your food. \n\nI've watched couples go to the bathroom together for what I could only guess was either a terrible, frightening emergency or a case of hormones run wild. I've seen people walk in and try to take a tray of food they obviously never ordered. I even watched one customer pull out a bag of weed when he meant to pull out his cash to pay- the cashier admonished him to hide it quickly, since there was a cop in the store.\n\nThe way movie ticket prices are these days, this is some of the cheapest visual entertainment in town.

If you're employed you are often obligated to go to your employer's party and pretend you are having fun.  If you are Jewish, like me, that problem is often exponential.  If you are also like me, and have massive commitment issues in every area of your life, you do not invite people to the holiday party that your roommate has been planning for weeks until the morning of the party.  As a result you are not surprised when 80% of your invited guests do not show up.  The people that do show up are treated to vinyl Talking Heads records (omg they rock!),  silent 1980's teen comedies that are playing on HBO2 (Private School), homemade guacamole (I used to work at Chipotle), and an otherwise raucously good time that is the result of 7 people talking about law school (please kill me I hate my life).  In my defense I like to think I make decent Old Fashioneds (Bulleit Rye 4 lyfe), provide fascinating conversation, and I think I already talked about the guacamole.  \n\nBut after everyone leaves what should I eat? (English teachers will often tell you not to start sentences, much less paragraphs, with And, But, or Or.  But they are wrong as fuck.  That's why they teach and don't ball out of control like me). And how should I get there?  My car is blocked in by my roommate's Infiniti in our apartment parking lot.  He is passed out on the couch.  It is 3 am.  His keys are lying there.  There is a Brooklyn Summer Ale in the refrigerator (another holiday party fact is that people like to bring expired beer).  I grab the Brooklyn, grab the keys, BOOM I'm driving an Infiniti despite the fact that I would probably blow a .60 if pulled over.  On the way Gotye with Kimbra is blasting on CD101 (or CD 102.5 whatever the fuck).  Great Thursday night.  I park behind a Dale Earnhardt Jr. fan in a red pickup truck at the Taco Bell Drive Thru.  2 hefty girls pop out of the truck and run behind the nearby fence giggling.  If I didn't know any better I would think they are urinating.  I hope there is toilet paper behind the fence.  A few minutes later they reappear looking much more relieved.  It is 4 am by the time I get home.  My roommate is still passed out on the couch.

I've been to many places where employees sounded nice but their body language said otherwise. Wish I could recall her name. Shouts out to you ma'am! One of my coworkers received the wrong order, 2 Cool Ranch tacos instead of one of each Dorito variety. The staff happily corrected the mistake and let him keep the erroneous taco. Another shout out goes to my coworker for letting me eat the extra taco. Appreciate it chief!\n\nFood is what you should expect at any Taco Bell. Not going to sugar coat it and try to critique ground beef and what it should taste like. You should already know. If you don't, you've lived a deprived life. I will say that if you were wondering which of the two Doritos tacos are better. Cool Ranch over Nacho Cheese. The Nacho Cheese flavor gets masks by the flavors of the taco's contents so I couldn't really taste the difference between it and a regular taco.

That was the next mistake. The \"bean burrito\" was literally just a tortilla with cheese, and I do not mean a quesadilla I mean they forgot the beans. The \"beef chalupa\" was a chicken Gordita.

I live for the Bell. I follow them on Instagram. Big fan. Needless to say, I live m\u00e1s.\n\nHaving said that, I was very disappointed by my experience with this location. Let me paint you a picture. I'm up late playing Madden 07 with some friends. After a few hours of sleep, I get woken up to a phone call around 730am. A friend of mine needs me to take them to the emergency room. She sliced herself while chopping up some lettuce for a salad, and before you ask, I don't know why she was preparing a salad that early. Anyways, I'm a decent friend so I oblige. We leave the hospital around 11 and I'm cravin some TBell, knowing in my heart that breakfast time has expired. There's one in close proximity, and I feel my level of stoke on the rise. Like more stoked than when Ben Affleck and Matt Damon won the Oscar for Good Will Hunting. \n\nWe get to the drive through and it's beautiful. A nice good looking TBell, the kind you would take a date to if you want to impress them. We order. I get my usual which includes, among other things, some Triple Layer Nachos and a couple of Double Decker Tacos with no lettuce. We've already had one lettuce incident today. I don't need another on my conscience. I exchange pleasantries with some employees and briefly mention my upcoming candle business. \n\nNow I'm driving home in my Smart Car after dropping my friend off at her place. She's doing okay by the way. And I'm driving and I can smell the Taco Bell and I just cannot wait any longer to eat! I'm so excited to eat, like on par excitement with Cuba Gooding JR winning the Oscar for Jerry Maguire.\n\nSo I unwrap my taco and there it is; a beautiful taco drowned in lettuce. I am devastated. \n\nThe nachos are dope though.

Anyway, order was placed, confirmation of order and payment was received. I got to the location and they had no record of the order. No one knew how to look up an order number to find it. They then said we had ordered via Grub Hub and the delivery driver must have picked it up. Nope, not a Grub Hub order. The night manager wouldn't give us the ordered food or refund the money. She kept saying if she gave us the food, we would just call the 800 number and get a refund. So we left with no food and no refund.\n\nI have called the 800 number multiple times, it is not working.

The person taking orders apologized for the delay and said that they had been swamped. There were only two (2) cars ahead of me so I don't know if two cars constitutes being \"swamped\" but anyhow I order 4 items and asked for a substitute on my chicken burrito, no rice and add beans. I finished my order and picked up my food at the window. Upon arriving home, I discovered on my receipt that I was charged .60 cents for the substitute. I wished I had been told about the charge prior to getting my order and I probably would have made a different choice. Beans are NOT avocados!!! Laughing\n\nAnyhow I slept on my frustration and called the location. And spoke to the Manager \"Maria\" about what had happened. She was uninterested in meeting the needs or expectations for a customer and blamed the delay on the fact that \"we did $700 in sales between 7 & 8 pm\" \"you should expect a delay when we have that much business and we were short staffed, people on break etc. Not this customers problem, hire more staff!!!\n\nWhen asked about the up-charge for beans, I was told \" that's your problem, the screen at the drive up window shows the charges\". I explained that after waiting nearly 20 minutes at a Taco Bell drive through, I just wanted to get my dinner and go home.

At some point however, the excuse becomes just that- an excuse. It's been several weeks since this place opened and so far we've had four bad experiences:\n\n- I waited in line for 15 minutes before someone came outside to tell me and the others in line that the refrigerator broke and they had to close. Fine, beyond your control. I get that totally. Why did it take 15 minutes to notify waiting customers?\n\n- My wife and I waiting for 45 minutes in the drive through, stuck between two cars and unable to leave, waiting for our massive order of 3 whole items. \n\n- Received our food in a reasonable time. Unfortunately there was no beef or sour cream on my wife's burrito and the side of guacamole we ordered was missing as well. \n\n- Just today we waited for 20 minutes for two items with one other person ahead of us. My chicken quesarito had the wrong chicken on it and my cheesy gordita crunch didn't have any baja sauce or shredded cheddar cheese. It's not hard: gordita shell with three cheese.

He said they were short-staffed (which I understand completely, but this is Taco Bell, not a sit down restaurant). We say there's no reason it should take as long as it did, so he all but threw our bags at us, with no apology to the inconvenience or the attitude of his employee.

Everyone was wearing proper uniforms and looked organized. The wait was just a bit longer than what it should be but has improved by far. The food was properly made and nothing was missing. Keep it up!\n\nGenerally I avoid writing negative reviews but this place is a joke. For background, I worked at a mall Taco Bell for 2 1/2 years as a teenager. We were busy as hell all the time, especially during the holidays. Even then we never had a turn around time of more than 10 minutes and when we had orders going heading up towards the 10 minute mark we addressed it with training and later firing if the employee couldn't carry their wait. This place clearly needs to revisit their approach on how to run a fast food franchise. \n\nObviously, I understand that the place is new and is staffed with mainly trainees. At some point however, the excuse becomes just that- an excuse. It's been several weeks since this place opened and so far we've had four bad experiences:\n\n- I waited in line for 15 minutes before someone came outside to tell me and the others in line that the refrigerator broke and they had to close. Fine, beyond your control. I get that totally. Why did it take 15 minutes to notify waiting customers?\n\n- My wife and I waiting for 45 minutes in the drive through, stuck between two cars and unable to leave, waiting for our massive order of 3 whole items. \n\n- Received our food in a reasonable time. Unfortunately there was no beef or sour cream on my wife's burrito and the side of guacamole we ordered was missing as well. \n\n- Just today we waited for 20 minutes for two items with one other person ahead of us. My chicken quesarito had the wrong chicken on it and my cheesy gordita crunch didn't have any baja sauce or shredded cheddar cheese. It's not hard: gordita shell with three cheese.

The girl was rude and after looking at the computer for all of 5 seconds tells him they are out of nacho cheese... after he just watched someone make a side. He had just worked 9 hours straight and was exhausted so he came home defeated and told me what happened. At this point I have had enough with their horrendous customer service and refusal to not be assholes that I went back down there. Waited 10 minutes before the rudest man I have ever met stomps up to the counter grumbles three words and guess what they have plenty of cheese!

During the day, my experiences with this Taco Bell have been about as good as any other. The problem is that during the day, there are plenty of food options more appealing than Taco Bell, so my visits are usually at night.\n\nThe night crew is generally pretty bad, but it seems to really depend who is working / managing for the night. My last experience was the most hilariously bad, and of course folks tend to leave reviews based on exceptionally good / bad experiences:\n\n1.

Pulled up to the window and clarified my order again for the fourth (or fifth) time, was told to pull around to the parking lot because they were cooking fresh potatoes (yay!). Asked for a few packets of fire sauce.\n\n3. Waited three or four minutes, which is par for the course when ordering potato items after ~11pm, and which I honestly prefer because the alternative is getting potatoes which are either inedibly lukewarm or burnt to a crisp.\n\n4. Got my food, went home, and did my best to enjoy my usual late night Taco Bell experience: 100% lukewarm spicy potato soft tacos, and bean paste which tasted like it was cooked an hour too long. Opened the bag and discovered I was given ~25 packets of hot sauce, which I promptly threw away because we already have about ~60 packets in our dedicated Excess Taco Bell Sauce Drawer because I'm incorrectly given hot sauce about half the time, which no one at our house eats.\n\nMy only problems with this location have occurred at night, and the issues are usually with food quality -- not with service. It's almost as if they turn off their fryers to save energy (resulting in almost inedibly lukewarm food), or food is cooked for much longer than it should be, resulting in a burnt taste / incinerated potatoes, etc.. To be fair, I don't think they've ever gotten my order wrong, and the service is usually pretty decent.\n\nIn the end, this is a Taco Bell -- so you can't expect much.

Which is a 4 dollar different for doing this for 6 tacos. I told them exactly what buttons to push since I previously worked at taco bell 8 years ago. They tried telling me that they have worked there for 10 years and that it's impossible to do it and has never been an option (funny part is that they did it 2 nights previously). Well they ended up telling me they will give it to me this time, but next time I have to talk to a manager. Well they didn't charge me extra at all. Which I was expecting to pay 4 dollars for substituting. So with that, it made me suspicious. After 25 minutes of waiting for $40 of food, I decide to check to see if the order was right and when I open the taco there is literally 1 piece of chicken broken into 2 in there in every taco. So I told the girl to come over and look at it and I asked her wtf is the problem with the two and she was stunned I noticed and said it was a taco. I then asked her why the hell there was only 2 half pieces of chicken and she said that it's an average portion size. I said she was full of crap because I worked at taco bell and know what a portion size is. This she actually had the nerve to say \"well you got what you paid for and you didn't pay for the chicken\" and I was like you gotta be f'in kidding me, you did this in retaliation to me telling you that you're wrong and there's a substitute chicken button. So I demanded a refund and then called their general manager. If I could give them 0 stars I would. It took 25 mins to make our food,  they were assholes, and tried to ruin a $40 meal.

Their slogan \"make a run for the border\" was catchy, and their neon sign lit up the dark sky like a welcoming beacon, so one evening when it was late and I was hungry, I finally stopped in. Boy, am I glad I did! \n\nThe menu here is chock full of a variety of choices that promised an authentic south of the border dining experience. The selection was so vast, in fact, I was feeling overwhelmed, and asked my waiter for a recommendation. We could not bridge the language barrier, however, because it sounded like he said \"whatever you feel like, ash roll.\" I'll have to brush up on my Spanish for my next visit. After much deliberation, I settled on a Doritos Locos taco with  ground beef, and a pair of steak Chalupas. The taco was delicious, the tortilla satisfyingly crunchy, with a unique blend of orange-tinted spices and herbs that tasted vaguely familiar, though I couldn't quite place the flavor. The ground beef - I'm pretty sure it was USDA Prime Choice - was browned with a nice char, and seasoned to perfection. My taco came with julienned strips of iceberg lettuce, fresh diced juicy red tomatoes, a dollop of sour cream, and shredded, aged cheddar. The homemade salsa was served in a convenient little packet in which you tear off a corner and squeeze onto your food. This is both fun, and allows for excellent portion control. Not a drop of the fiery hot sauce went to waste. Like the taco itself, the flavors sang to me! At that point I was afraid the rest of my meal might pale in comparison, but there was no need to worry. The chalupas were every bit as divine. The chalupa shell managed to pull off the feat of being both crispy and chewy at once, testament to the chef's cooking prowess and knowledge of fine Mexican cuisine. It came with thick strips of marinated premium-quality steak - if I had to guess, I'd say it was Kobe beef - grilled to medium-rare perfection. The accompanying vegetables were every bit as fresh and tasty as those that were served with my taco. I washed down my meal with a golden, carbonated beverage that I believe is native to the Jalisco region of Mexico. Locals refer to it as \"dew from the mountains,\" though I cannot recall its actual name. (Ask your server next time, but remember to brush up on your Espanol first)! The dessert specials looked enticing, especially the twisted Mexican doughnut (similar to a cruller) dusted in a sweet sugar and cinnamon blend and served piping hot, but I was too full to contemplate ordering anything else. Which simply gives me the perfect excuse to return here for another wonderful meal!\n\nThey say it is the little hole-in-the-wall restaurants that surprise and impress the most, and my experience at Taco Bell proves this to be true. I'm only disappointed that it took me so long to discover this hidden gem! I highly recommend it to anybody craving an exotic, wonderfully prepared multi-course Mexican meal.

However, it seems as though they choose not to. \n\nWe had an order for 5 people for dinner. The first thing that upset me was the man taking the orders. I thought I was being nice and helping by explaining that it was long order. He said \"then come inside\". I explained that I was disabled and that's why I was in tye drive thru to begin with. His response \"yeah ok!\" Said in a tone of yeah I don't believe you. After I ordered and paid it got worse. To start off, they forgot 3 cinnatwist. I was able to point that out before pulling away from the drive-thru window. That saved me time and gas and pain and aggregation of going back up there, or so I though. (Ended up going back anyway)Then when I got home, I passed out the food. \n\nPart of the order was 2 steak soft tacos with NO sauce. (They come with this advacado ranch sauce that I hate!) They both had that nasty sauce everywhere. I took them along with the bean burrito I ordered for myself back up there.  It took me about 3 mins til I was able to explain what happened. It took 16.48 minutes to the food replaced. Its a good thing I asked for a fresh burrito too. It would have been ice cold. There were no orders in the front at this time after I ordered. There were a lot of orders in the drive thru. They cleared that board before fixing my food. I did watch so that they couldn't do anything bad to it.

Of is it they don't want you to order on their dollar menu? \nThis place smells like franchise. And, whoever took it over, is a penny pinching scrooge.

I put fast in quotation marks because this location is far from fast. Expect to wait a minimum of 15 minutes. \nThe last time I went was by far the worst. \nThere was only one car in front of me but he seemed to be having an issue and was yelling at the lady as he was ordering. So it took about ten minutes to even get my order taken. Waited another ten for the food. \nIt was a teenage girl working who clearly thought she was way to good for the job and her attitude was showing all around. \nShe handed me the bag, but I asked her if there was any sauce in the bag. \nShe said no, you didn't ask for any sauce (of course with a snarky attitude). \nOkay, anyone who ever goes to any Taco Bell can back me up on this one. They always ask you what kind of sauce you want when they have your order in their hand. \nAs I drove away the car line increased to over ten cars, all I was thinking was good luck you will be there a while. \nGot home with my tbell, opened my potato taco to put some sauce and there was 4 tiny scraps of potatoes. What the heck! And I had two more potato tacos the same way.

On 10/13 I came through the drive through around 2-3 am after an evening of celebrating my 22nd birthday. Taco Bell has great options for modifying their menu due to diet restrictions and food allergies. I've been vegan for over a year and prior to that, vegetarian for over three years. So with Taco Bell's modifications that can be made, it was still one of the few places where I can go to veganize certain menu items. I ordered the triple layer nachos fresco style and a Mexican pizza fresco style as well with refried beans as a beef substitute. I'm always VERY clear with my order, specifying that when I order fresco style I mean no nacho cheese, dairy, etc and that I need beans substituted for beef. I've been working in the restaurant industry for four years and when I take my tables orders I make sure that proper communication is made, especially when dealing with diet restrictions. I ordered my food and headed to a friends to eat my meal. My nachos came as usual and after devouring those, I started to eat my Mexican pizza. A few bites into the pizza I realized that something wasn't right and that it tasted.... Different. I had my friend try a bite (who has no dietary restrictions) and he told me that it tasted like it had meat mixed in. I opened up the shell and after dissecting the pizza (see attached photos) to my horror I realized that mixed into the beans were random spoonfuls of BEEF. This had to have been done intentionally. Taco Bell's beans do not contain lard, they are PETA certified. It's safe to say that I got very sick after the few bites that I did manage consume. I've spent a good portion of my birthday in bed due to stomach problems. Diet restrictions, food allergies, and menu modifications SHOULD be taken seriously. They are not a joke. Just because someone CHOOSES not to consume something doesn't mean that it's acceptable to sneak that item into the meal because someone thinks it's \"funny.\" I am disgusted with the way that I was treated at this Taco Bell.

Taco Bell is also up there on my list of late-night fast food cravings, but the popcorn chicken combo usually wins out. \n\nI moved to Quincy in February and this establishment happens to be the closest fast food restaurant to my apartment. Since February, I have paid this drive thru a few visits and was shocked at how horrible the service was. Not only is this the worst KFC/Taco Bell I have ever been to, this was the worst fast food restaurant I have ever purchased food from.\n\nThe Drive-Thru: No matter what day of the week or time you go to this place, the service is unbelievably slow, incompetant and inconsistent. Last night, I enterred this drive thru at 9:45PM and did not pull away from the window until 10PM. I was offered no explanation as to why the line was delayed or an apology of any kind. Also, after I placed my order and pulled up to the pick-up window, I was told that there was no more Pepsi. When I asked the girl to calculate my order without the soda, my request was met with attitude. She also snapped that she didn't have any change in the register, so I had to dig through my wallet to find coins so that she could give me bills back. I know this is a single example of the poor service, but all of my visits have been equally as frustrating. No forks given when I ordered mac and cheese with a meal? No wedges available? Even worse, no CHICKEN available? More than once I have had to sit and stare through the glass window after giving them my money for over 5 minutes before getting anyone's attention - no explanation for delay offered- turns out that they were frying more chicken, while there is a line behind me, and didn't think to let me know so I could pull over and let the other orders through. The drive-thru is so slow, in fact, that on Friday and Saturday nights the line is so long that it ends up in the street, causing additional traffic at an already congested intersection.\n\nThe store itself: disgusting. The floors are always sticky and there is constantly trash on the tables and floor because the employees do not clean up anything. The condiments and papergoods like soda covers, straws and napkins ALWAYS need to be refilled. Don't even get me started on the bathrooms. \n\nBottom-line: Avoid this KFC/Taco Bell at all costs. \n\n1 star because I like the food, but the poor service and unsanitary conditions seriously need to be addressed.

The ladies room had 2 stalls--1 that was a handicap stall, and the other that was so tiny, I thought I was going to get stuck in it (I'm 8 months pregnant and someone was having a heck of a time finishing their business in the other more roomy stall). But that didn't kill my experience. I waded through a sea of high-top tables & chairs to stand in line for 10 min (behind 2 people) and ordered my food at 6:57pm. I went to fill my drink, and found that the Sweet Tea was almost empty, but since I usually use 1/2 sweet & 1/2 unsweet, it was just enough to fill my cup (I then emptied the container when I left--with no concern shown by the staff for brewing more.) Come 7:15pm, I still did not have my order, so I went to the counter and when asked by the manager, heard the girls on the line say my order still wasn't ready even though, they weren't that busy. I watched them slow-poke around, and they eventually finished my order another 3-4 min later. The manager did nothing to help them and said nothing to me, although the lady at the counter apologized for the wait. I then sat in the dining room with the ambient music blaring at a level much higher than a typical fast food place, and ate the stale gordita crunch, and sloppy burrito supreme that came in my box. This is by far one of the worst fast food experiences I've had in a long time--that's if you can classify this restaurant as \"fast\" food, which I wouldn't. I think a visit from someone higher on the chain is definitely in order to fix this store.

I always have to order one of those. Love those things. Especially covered in hot sauce! Anyway, with tax, the order came to $9.36.\nAs I mentioned, service is always friendly.

All employees were courteous and made sure that the service was fast, all condiments were available and well stocked, and that the dining area was clean.\nLet's face it. It is more of a fast food restaurant than it is a Mexican restaurant. But if you are tired of hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, and hoagies for lunch, this is a good change of place.\nThe only problem I have with this Taco Bell is that you have to deal with the traffic in the SoDo plaza and parking lot in order to get to the restaurant.

The wrong cheese, no sauce, and just beans and crunchy flat tortilla.  This was more puzzling that the enigma codes cracked during world war 2.

She was great --honestly. I asked her about one of the drinks they sell (Mountain Dew Sangrita) and she immediately offered me a sample. Who knew you could sample at a fast food restaurant? The interior was clean too. I didn't notice any dirty messes or I cleaned tables. When it was my turn to order, I ordered my three Doritos tacos which came out in less than 5 minutes (expected because it's a fast food shop). The tacos were okay, the shells were a little soggy but maybe that's because of the lettuce inside. Out of all three I recommend the \"cooler ranch Doritos\" taco. If you like something spicy and hot, you will love their newest Doritos taco \"fiery Doritos\". For this visit to Taco Bell to be my first in two years, I give it a 4 stars. The cashier was very accommodating and made me feel welcomed. She didn't treat me like someone who just came in to get food, if that makes sense. And I noticed she treated the other guests just the same like me. That definitely helped to make whole Taco Bell experience great. :)", "date": "2016-01-29 14:44:38"}, {"review_id": "TIcZJrfb1HsdSMLrb6h9MQ", "user_id": "1uGFqIDA5vSwVwNzuR1oOA", "business_id": "y4sY2jzSF8vG4rv26Eks6g", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I'm vegetarian so I ask for my beef to be replaced by black beans every time.

I've received a completely incorrect order from a cashier who wouldn't make eye contact or speak to me. And it always takes 8-10 minutes for me to get my two cheesy gordita crunches when I go inside. \nThis time I went because I read they were giving away a free taco to every customer this afternoon. I felt awkward saying \"I want the free taco\", so i ordered my cheesy gordita crunch and figured they would put the free taco in automatically. I was standing to the side waiting for my food and a staff member put a bag on the counter and said what sounded like \"Brenda\" (my name's Tricia). No one came to claim the bag. A few minutes later the cashier walked up, looked in the bag and yelled back to the kitchen \"whose food is this?\" I dont know if they answered her but the cashier then walked away. After this, as I still waited, I decided I better tell the cashier about the free taco. She asked me what my order was again and I told her a cheesy gordita crunch she said \"That's not free but I can ring you up for a free regular taco\".

I told her that it had been sitting there since before I ordered my taco so it's not mine. But I honestly think she was confused by what was happening and said I should take the taco. Her tone made me think she thought she was giving me a bonus. Like she was giving me food that I didn't order. To be fair: it was what I ordered, but it was sitting there before I ordered it.

Saying this because I have been to many.  I was trapped in the drive thru today for over 30 minutes.  Could not back out because of cars behind me.  The service was soooo sloooow.  The Customer Service was HORRIBLE.  Once I got to the speaker to order- It took them aprox. 2 minutes before they even said anything.  I had to keep saying \"Hello, Hello\". And once he got on the line, no apologies for the long wait or anything. Once I got to the pick-up window,I asked for  the Manager- The person I was speaking to stated she was the Manager- Her name was Samantha. She too, did not offer any apologies.  I asked what took so long and she told me first of all I did not wait as long as I told her I did.  She wanted to argue with me instead.  She did mentioned they were only working with a crew of 3.  I informed that I was sorry about that, but that is not my fault. And as a customer, I should be respected a little better than that. If they were only working with 3- Maybe they should have closed drive thru all together.  There is no reason someone should wait in drive thru for over 30min in the hot sun.  On top of that the 2 freezes that I ordered were melted by the time I got them.  I asked for a refund and she told me she had  already charged my card and she could not refund me.  On top of that, she told me I was holding up her drive thru.  I be damn!! So, now I'm the reason the drive thru is so slow.  I asked for corporate's phone # and she told me to go online to get it.  I felt this was really rude of her. The people  in the restaurant started looking towards drive-thru because of the commotion we was creating. I had to get loud because she kept cutting me off when I talked.  All she had to due, was first apologize for the delay, and refund my money.  No- she did none of that- so here I am. I will be contacting the Manager/Owner Alex next.  Thanks to the other person working - who was nice enough to provide the owners name.

No, not at all so I wasn't too disappointed with the taste. Here's my thoughts...\n\nShredded Chicken Burrito- I've had better but I've also had worse. Not a ton of flavor and pretty skimpy with the chicken. I'd suggest adding extra. Definitely the smallest burrito I ever had but a good value for the price. Might buy again someday.\n\nDoritos Taco Locos- Hated this and it went into the trash can after two bites. The worst hard shell Taco I've ever tried. The entire bottom stuck to the paper and stayed there when I removed the taco. Didn't taste like Doritos to me. Would never order this again.\n\nShredded Chicken Quesadilla Melt- Probably my favorite of the food items. A small but good Quesadilla that was nicely done. Would definitely get again. \n\nSeasoned Rice- I've had better from a package. Seriously. It was undercooked, a lot of hard pieces of rice in there. Had no flavor even after I added two packets of their mild sauce. A big pass for me. \n\nChips and Cheese- Good, no complaints. Too bad these are being taken off the menu soon because I would have gotten them again. \n\nCinnabites- I was actually kind of disappointed by these.

As someone who doesn't drive & is looking to avoid continuously paying delivery fees, I appreciate having the lobby takeout option, as well as the option to order & checkout without any verbal interaction taking place. As an additional bonus, this location has yet to include meat or dairy in any of my vegan orders & I've visited, albeit occasionally, since 2013.

I've gone exactly once a week for three weeks and every time I went, there were problems.\n\nFor starters, the design of the area for what goes where is just a disaster. Granted, they probably don't have a lot of room to work with, so I'm trying not to criticize this too much, but the prep area is enormous and is right smack dab in the middle of the \"restaurant,\" which forces waiting customers to bottleneck themselves to the left if they're waiting in line. \n\nNot a huge deal, but they also put a self-serve screen kiosk in the middle of the action as well, so you have clusters of people waiting for their food, clusters of people waiting to use the self-service kiosk, and a jumbled line of people waiting in the main line to order... and we're ALL in each other's way.\n\nAnd because they're still a fairly new presence in this part of Boston, it's packed with customers.  So, imagine how awesome it was this past Monday (October 7, 2019) when their A/C wasn't working, the place is packed (again) and their soda machine isn't working, leaving customers to get either a bottle of water, a Diet Pepsi, or a slushie. \n\nI went with the Diet Pepsi, which they gave to me in a can... and there was a small lump of frozen slush at the bottom of my can of Diet Pepsi, leaving ME to believe perhaps they accidentally re-routed all the cold from the A/C to whatever fridge is keeping these cans cold.  Again, not a huge deal in and of itself, but when you consider the size of the cups they give you when you order a numbered value meal, one can of Diet Pepsi would fill about HALF of one of those cups, so when I went to get a second can later in my meal, the cashier charged me like $2.75 for it when she should have just given it to me free of charge.\n\nAfter all, it's not MY fault your soda machine broke down less than a month in... and when I got THAT can, about half of THAT was filled with frozen slush.  That was my most recent visit. The visit before that, the self-serve kiosk was out of order and they were severely understaffed so they were getting slammed. The woman who I'm guessing was the manager was helping the other two folks get the food ready, but one of the customers in front of me started complaining about the wait. The manager wasn't rude to her, but it was pretty clear she just did NOT give a crap that they were crawling through food orders. \n\nLastly, of the three times I've gone there, they've managed to screw up my order twice. The first time, they forgot the crunchy taco that accompanies the quesadilla meal and the second time, they put sour cream in my 5-layer beef burrito after I very politely and clearly asked the cashier to please omit the sour cream. \n\nThey're very close to where I work so I won't give up on them yet, and I know they're all still very new, but good grief, they really gotta get their sh*t together.

Your food will either be ready for you and/or the employees will put the final sauces, napkins, etc in your bag.\n3) Walk out/Drive out and head home to enjoy your food. \n\nOrdering through the app the first time I had my suspicions that my order would be incorrect, lacking, etc however the app really eliminated any discrepancies and allowed me to expand my order and tailor my food to my liking. You can pay over the app which I highly recommend because Taco Bell will sometimes add coupons and discounts to your order(s) on the occasional basis. I got $2 off my $12 order and I was a happy lady when I checked out on the app and paid for my meal. \n\nDo it.

By reading other reviews Ive been able to learn a lot about my surroundings, and I've met some wonderful people along the way.  Yelpers have somehow managed to circumvent the mean-spirted and vapid state that has permeated so many social media sites.  That being said, I think that we reviewers are sometimes hasty to post a review based on what I view as fairly minor issues.  Judge the business, not the incident, especially if the incident was more than likely a one-off occurance in an otherwise good experience.\n\nWhich brings me to, of all places, Taco Bell, at the corner of Bethel and Sawmill.  Yes, I eat at Taco Bell, and what's more, I enjoy it!  I do love fine dining, but I am anything but an affected foodie... I like what I like.  There are some itches that only a Taco Bell can scratch! :)  So one day I find myself in their drive-thru, waiting in line for my seven layer burrito and fiesta potatoes, and as I get to the window I am greeted by a man in his mid-20s in the most welcoming way you could imagine.  It wasn't a scripted blurb spoken by a painted smile, hoping to talk me into super-sizing my order or some other such promotion.  He literally seemed happy to see me and have my business, all $3.18 of it.  I smiled back, somewhat oddly, completed my transaction, and after a hearty farewell and a wave from Mr. Smiley, I was on my way.  I chalked him up as most certainly the business owner, and it was probably his first few months in that title.  That theory was called into question the following week when I returned to that location and placed another order.  This time it was a woman, probably in her early 30s, giving me a greeting that was just as natural and yet as exuberant as Mr. Smiley's.  A co-owner?  Perhaps, but now they had my attention.  Over the next few visits, I had similar encounters, which left me scratching my head.  Either this store was putting something in their employees' water or they were just getting really really lucky with hiring friendly staff.  Was this one of those unanswerable questions?\n\nFinally I just decided to accept this little fast food oasis as a reminder that regardless of what we are consuming, be it tacos or a hotel room or overpriced cable TV, great customer service makes ANY consumer experience better.

I will no longer ever return to this particular location. Here are three desperate incidences and I am dumb for returning after the first. \n\nIncident 1.) We spent approximately 30 minutes waiting in line to reach the speaker (we were socializing, so didn't realize how much time had actually passed until afterwards), and by the time we ordered at the speaker, waited yet another 10 minutes to inch up to the window. When we finally felt as though we had been waiting in a doctors office and it was finally our turn(!) we reached the window to find the cashier throwing. Let me repeat that. THROWING her speaker headset at the window screaming \"I'm done with this shit!\" I didn't know if my food was going to be safe and sanitary so we decided best to go across the street to steak and shake and of course, watch the police arrive. \n\nIncident 2.) I ordered a sweet tea with my meal. The last time I had a soda was in 2006. Clearly it's been years (as this incident was in 2014), and the cashier hands me a sprite. Politely I say, \"oh, I'm sorry, I ordered a sweet tea\". This very rude girl has the audacity to tell me I ordered a sprite. No ma'am. Get the wax out of your ears and stop with your ghetto yelling in the back and pay attention. I do not drink soda. Pretty sure I would know this out of the two of us, right? But after hearing her argue with me, I took the sprite and threw the liquid from the drink on the ground on the way home. No need to waste a perfectly good cup holder. \n\nIncident 3.) Tonight I go through, after my birthday celebration to order food on my way home. There's nothing like LYSOL covered tacos in the morning! But why wait? Taco Bell serves you until 2 am. Nothing like cleaning supplies to make you feel like they're doing a good job keeping down those germs! They should team up with orbit for that clean sparkly mouth! ;-) Are you kidding me?!?! To top it off the Cinnabon treats were so cold it felt like an ice cube. No. \n\nThis is ridiculous and you should be shut down.

But the last 2 or 3 times I've visited I left HIGHLY pissed. \n\nLet me start by saying this.....my lunch break is 30 minutes. Enough time to drive around the corner and get a number 7 right?? First off when you finally make it to the speaker they tell you to hold for hmmm..maybe 4 or 5 minutes - but hey that's cool right? Cause we got about 20 mins or so for lunch. \n\nSo the order is finally put in and we drive to the window pay for our meal and everything is smooth sailing. We still got a little time for break. So...5 minutes go by but you're on the phone so time flies and you haven't given much notice. \n\nOkay we got around 15 minutes or so but it's cool cause we still have a little bit of time. \n\n5 more minutes go by and now you're getting kinda annoyed. We haven't seen anyone since we paid. No one bothered to say, \"hey this may take a little while can you pull up?' Not one word.\n\nA few more minutes go by and now you're pissed. You already paid so you can't leave the line. There are cars lining up behind you and there's STILL no one to be seen. And now you're down to 2 minutes before your break it up.\n\nSo now your lunch is up! 30 minutes exactly. You're furious because you basically wasted you're whole damn lunch waiting...oh and let's not forget the only thing you ordered was 2 mini chicken quesadilla and a mountain dew and now they are cutting into YOUR time and YOUR money.\n\nA minute later they just throw you your food and forget to put in the mild sauce you requested.....\n\n\nI say all this to say...I get it. It's taco bell for christ's sake, I don't expect to get any 5 star treatment but dammit are you really going to waste my ENTIRE lunch break waiting on 2 little ass quesadillas?????? And not even have the courtesy to let me know it may take some time so I can go elsewhere and spend my money. \n\nI am so through with this location.

It wasn't busy, so our food came out quick.  I wasn't super hungry, so all I ordered was two crunchy tacos.\n\nThere were maybe two or three other tables of customers when we walked around to look for a table.  The first table we sat at was super wobbly, and when my friend turned around to check the table behind him, he saw that there were two seats but no table where one should have been.  Can you say \"ghetto\"?  In addition, many of the tables were dirty, and there was trash scattered around on the floor.  Ick.\n\nWe found and sat at one of the cleaner tables, and I finally started to eat my first taco when I realized that the shell was cold and kind of stale.  The beef inside the taco was warm, but I really did not enjoy the taco shell.  Fortunately, my second taco's shell was crunchy and good.\n\nOverall, this Taco Bell gets 2 stars because although their food is usually just like any other Taco Bell, the inside of the restaurant looks really old, beaten up, and unkept.  It really turned me off from wanting to eat inside again.

I'll get a burrito from the drive-thru, then sit in my car in the Walmart parking lot and eat...while sobbing uncontrollably, wondering where I went wrong in life...and why they only gave me one Fire sauce packet.\n\nA few months ago, I decided to eat in the dining room (which closes at 10pm, I believe). It was your typical remodeled Taco Bell: lots of purple around, overhead hanging lamps, a combination of low chairs/booths and high chairs/high tables, pIctures of Lorena Garcia everywhere...you know, regular Taco Bell.\n\nA woman in front of me was with her daughter, and it looked like they both just got out of work, since they were both wearing Macy's name tags on their shirts. Mother and daughter working at the same store? That's weird. Anyway, the mother ordered something that I've never even heard of before: Cheese Roll-ups. [http://www.tacobell.com/food/menuitem/Cheese-Roll-Up] I was so intrigued by her order, that I decided to order one with my meal. It's basically a tortilla with cheese, rolled up. And it tasted like...a tortilla with cheese, rolled up. Who the hell would come to Taco Bell to get this? You could go to the Walmart 100 feet away, and get a pack of tortillas and a pack of cheese for less than you paid for two Cheese Roll-ups. Whatever. As I sat down, realizing what a waste of money that Cheese Roll-up was, I saw a woman sitting by herself. it looked like she finished eating, and was just doing the \"gonna sit here and keep refilling my drink, because refills are free, beotch\"-routine. We've all done that before. But something was different. This woman was talking out loud, and was very passionate when she spoke. She was talking about Nationwide Insurance, and how their hiring practices were shady, and how she knew many people that lost their jobs. It seemed like she was arguing with someone regarding benefits packages, and unlawful termination. It was a pretty intense conversation...so intense that I was live-tweeting it. When there was a brief lull in the conversation, I got up to refill my drink, beotch. I walked past her, expecting to see her holding a phone to her head, or wearing a bluetooth headset.\n\nShe had neither a phone nor a bluetooth headset.\n\nThis woman was having this intense conversation, which sounded completely legitimate and not crazy at all, with herself. Out loud. For everyone to hear. This was really strange. Stranger than the mother-daughter-we-both-work-at-Macy's-Cheese-Roll-up-outing. As I sat down to drink my Mountain Dew Baja Blast--available only at Taco Bell--I noticed the woman glance at me, and whisper something to her invisible companion. I felt really uncomfortable and decided to leave.\n\nI like this Taco Bell location. Drive-thru is fast, and they'll give you a lot of sauce packets if you say \"Can I have a bunch of all of them?\" when they ask you what kind you'd like. It's in close proximity to Walmart, which is open 24 hours, so you can go in and wash your hands when you finish eating in your car. But the real excitement comes from eating in the dining room after 9pm.

Go in and there's no line, but no one at the register for at least 3-4 minutes. Finally a dude walks up, he looks upset and right before I order the guy yells \"we're out of ground beef, but can do steak and chicken\". Next thing he looks at this older couple next to me and is all nice when he offers to replace their beef with steak or chicken. So then he comes back to me and I told him what I want and he asked steak or chicken and then tells me crazy price. I questioned it and he says \"there is an up charge for the steak\". So I'm all like \"nah, you just gave it to those people and beef clearly isn't option.\" This dude looks at me and says \"it's not my fault that we don't have beef, I can't control that.\" Y'all, I looked this dude in his eye sockets and said \"it's not your fault that y'all didn't cook enough beef?\"  I was over it, so I just left and I called the 800 number and they sent me 2 $5 coupons. Now onto visit 2. \n\n2. So I have 1 of my $5 coupons in hand and I drive over and order from the drive thru. I get up there and homeboy tells me \"we don't accept these.\"  I'm immediately shocked and explain to him why I have this thing and he was cool and went ahead and took it. But then he tells me that they ran out of the Cinnabon dessert that I just ordered and then I got home and my quesadilla was way over cooked. Whatever, it was mostly free, so it's cool. Now onto visit 3. \n\n3. Just now I go up there and I walk in this time. For starters the dude behind the register looks like a homeless guy they pulled off the street this morning. No uniform shirt, no name tag, shirt all dirty and wrinkled and he just looked sketchy. So I'm ordering and he just looks so angry to be alive and working at Taco Bell. When I'm done I hand him this coupon and he snaps \"we don't accept these, you can't use this\" and he tried to throw it away. We go back and forth, I explain how I got it and he tells me something about headquarters won't take them. They sent me the thing, why would they not accept it? So he gets someone else and she condescendingly asks how I got it as if I'm printing these in my basement so I can save $5. She finally says \"we'll accept it this time, but we're not supposed to\" as if she's doing me a favor. \nThen the guy commences to tell me that I have to get some box, that I can't use it for what I ordered. Yet again, the coupon doesn't say anything about that. So I take the coupon back and I say \"you guys suck\" as I walk away and the guy says \"f**k you, go to hell.\" Classy right?\nSo I've called their 800 number again, but highly doubtful I'm going back here.

One, and probably the most important, is that it's Taco Bell.  This fact alone should set expectations in a very reasonable and realistic fashion.  You are not expecting fine dining, great service or a plush atmosphere.  You're expecting cheap, tasty tacos to be served to you expediently.  And those were pretty much my only expectations.  \n\nSo, I had planned to go to Chick-fil-a but because of the odd setup with the median, I missed the turn in.  Being in a hurry and not terribly picky I came across Taco Bell next, and so Taco Bell it was.  If you really want to get specific it's technically a Taco Bell/Long John Silvers.  \n\nUpon entering, it became obvious that things simply weren't moving at the pace that you'd expect from a fast food establishment.  There were multiple people waiting for orders and nobody at the register.  I waited several moments and someone finally showed up to take my order.  I went with the 3 crunchy tacos combo meal.  That's it.  I sat down and proceeded to wait.  It took 17 minutes from the time I ordered (I checked the time stamp on my receipt) for me to get 3 crunchy tacos.  Not acceptable.  Everything tasted fine but I should have been in and out in 17 minutes.  I'm not sure what the issue was.  It wasn't unduly busy.  It doesn't really matter.

We pulled forward and paid for both of the orders. 3rd is we were given 1/2 of the 1st order and just the $5.00 box for the 2nd order. We didn't receive the $5.00 box for the 1st order nor did we get the drink for the 2nd order. We only realized the drink missing on the 2nd order so we sat in the drive threw for about 2 to 3 minutes while being ignored. When she finally did came back to the window we could tell she was very annoyed by us s still being at the window as she asked what we need and before we could say anything she blurted out. \"oh yeah the drink.\" I asked before driving away is that everything. and she replied \"yes\". We got home and no $5.00 box for 1st order and no receipt for both orders. my girlfriend and our friend b ok th got there food but I did not  So we tried to call and number attached to this taco bell given by Google and on the Taco Bell Website.

We called the next day and a woman answered the phone we asked to speak to manager and we were replied with they are bizzy and i can help you and wanted to know what we wanted, so we told her, she replied with do you have the Receipt. And again like I said earlier we were not give bbn a receipt that night.  She said no she can't do it without receipt and offered a $1.00 burrito  to compensate for the $5.00 loss we took.  She we started no not good enough!  I just want the food I played for.  So we asked to speak to the manager again!  And again she said no, she said manager was not available and she wouldn't even take our names or phone number to have them call back and then she hung up on us. I called back probably 3 more times no answer. Then called TacoBell Corporate  and filed a complaint. which still hasn't been resolved or even contacted back and said we are sorry and you can come get the food you paid for at the least.

I noticed the girl who took our order and Money standing around talking to the kids and yes they were kids, at the next window just as fast as I questioned it and then they say \"pull up to the curb we have to count the drawer\" it took 35 minutes for them to do so and the manager for the evening came out with a HORRIBLE attitude accusing us of being wrong when the receipt in our hand said what we were saying so the receipt backed us up.. she said \"well here's 5 dollars out of my pocket\" I took it from her and said \" that's not the point the point is that your employees are STEALING money from customers and it's not right I want MY original 5 dollars that's on her body, in her pockets\" the manager proceeded to say \"she doesn't have it the drawer is even\" I said \"yeah I know, cuz she's been pocketing money all damn day so of course it will be even\"..this is not the first time this has happened and it's not the first time they got our order wrong. nothing has ever done to make the situation right especially when it comes to stealing money. If you choose to eat here I would watch the money very closely and demand they give you the right change right then and there..I would even venture to say call the cops if you run into the situation I did last night. The manger who allowed this to happen AND the person who was doing it needs to be fired ON THE SPOT! If this happens again to us the cops WILL be called and people WILL be searched!", "date": "2019-08-07 19:30:19"}, {"review_id": "3N6gaPogf_keI7Gb5biRFg", "user_id": "9dZQkfwTWE3AUviKSlwpaw", "business_id": "JeH7svzG58hQc2y0yg38jQ", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Terrible service, food is not cooked enough, cold raw and disgusting, don't eat here this location should be closed!!!", "date": "2018-10-15 05:07:15"}, {"review_id": "_W8xtA732EGK0hSVnwH3Sg", "user_id": "wF2Cf03eWMlIwdm4iZeJ3Q", "business_id": "aUGtJVW9zCCttBbbWGMa-A", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I don't get it how do you not know what order you put in the bag .

Literally a minute drive from my house. It's never out of my way, and my toddler loves him a cheese roll up. This staff is operating on a level I didn't even know possible, like I actually have had in depth conversations with my friends about this Taco Bell and it's staff on numerous occasions. It is nothing less than perplexing. Why am I writing a review for a Taco Bell? Who knows. No one needs a review for Taco Bell, you know what it is, you know what you're paying for. But here we both are. \n\nFirst off, I swear the hiring criteria here is: you must either be legitimately the nicest person on planet earth or you have to be on quaaludes 24/7 and have minimal grasp on how to function as an adult. It's about a 50/50 mix. I get tons of compliments on my hair and nails. One guy will recognize my car and tell me to come up to the window when I get to the speaker. I usually only order a Mountain Dew (why is Taco Bell Mountain Dew vastly superior to all other Mountain Dews?), he usually gives it to me for free. The nice employees will say hi to my kids and just generally live up to the \"nicest person on planet earth\" label. \n\nBut man, if you're rolling up at midnight or later you are in for a treat. And by treat I mean ineptitude so astounding that it can't be anything but absurdly hysterical. I'm not being sarcastic, I genuinely love these late night adventures. I could probably write a blog about the ridiculous things I've had grown adults do and say at this location. \n\nOne night, I have a conversation that follows:\n\"One large Mountain Dew and one quesadilla.\"\n\"Wait, a quesadilla? Like with cheese?\"\n\"Yes, just the cheese quesadilla.\"\n\"So one cheese quesadilla.\"\n\"Yup, one cheese quesadilla and one large Mountain Dew.\"\n\"A Mountain Dew?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"... what size?\"\n\"A large.\"\n\"So a large Mountain Dew?\"\n\"Yes, and the cheese quesadilla.\"\n\nThat's not an exaggeration, I pulled into the parking lot after to text my friend the interaction that had just happened. And, I was given a medium Mountain Dew and a chicken quesadilla. \n\nAnother night, it was around 1am. I have a clear view of the store once I pull onto Worthington Galena. Theres no one else at Taco Bell. No one had recently left before. No one was behind me. It was just me and had been for a while. I order a drink, those chicken nacho chips they had at the time, and a cheese roll up. Dude seems flustered taking my order but nothing I felt the need to write down immediately after, I pull up, hand him a $20, get my food and remind him I had a drink. He gives me the wrong one and has to make another. I pull out of the drive thru and realize my order is two quesadillas, two soft tacos, and a bean burrito. There was no one else around for him to accidentally mix up our orders. When I came back he admitted he must have heard me wrong. Please take a moment to compare the order I placed to what I got. What in the actual heck. I had paid for this big order too so he ends up pulling $15 out of his pocket and hands it to me. \n\nI have numerous other late night incidents like these but I feel like the aforementioned visits paint a clear visit at the levels of nonsense that can happen hear. Any fast food chain would be a 3 star due to lackluster food quality and mediocre service but the sheer absurdity of this place earns an additional star. Thanks for the lols Taco Bell quaalude users, you've made my nights infinitely more amusing over the last two years.\n\nEdit: not even 24 hours after this post I stop by for a, you guessed it, large Mountain Dew. The man is barely audible over the speaker. The total was $2.14. I hand him a 5 and 14 cents. He hands me a Baja blast, I tell him I just wanted the regular Mountain Dew. He hands me another drink, and $2.75 in change. He walks away from the window. Okay then. I drive away, my drink is a diet Mountain Dew.

I pulled into the parking lot and had planned to go through the drive thru. Unfortunately, a truck making a delivery had parked in the middle of the parking lot and blocked the way. When I saw that the door for the main entrance was open I just walked in. It was 10:50pm on a Sunday evening and several people that looked like customers were inside the lobby area. After waiting at the counter for short bit, an employee barked at me asking what I was doing inside. I explained that I try to order food. He barked at me to get out of the lobby and use the drive through(in a manner in which no customer should be talked to). I tried to explain that a truck was blocking the way to the drive thru which lead to that Taco Bell employee blowing up and using explicit language. I asked for the manager in which he responded that he was the manager. I asked for his name but he refused to give it to me. Another crew member was standing by and said that his name was \"Carlos\"(which he thought was hilarious).

The Wendy's has been great when I've stopped there, the Jimmy John's and Subway were fine, but I've had some of the worst experiences when getting fast food in Columbus at the Burger King, McDonald's, and of course Taco Bell located in this shopping plaza.\n\nThe first time I went, it was a Monday night about 10:00 a few years ago, and normally that's not really a busy time, but the drive thru line was already really backed up when I pulled in, and I decided to wait because I didn't want to drive all the way to Kenny Road one thinking that they would catch up and speed things up. I was wrong about that as it took forever not only to finally put in my order but also in waiting for them to prepare it.\n\nSo after that I've avoided them, but with everything going on right now, I stopped in really quickly at Walmart to pick up an order, and then just decided that I'd go through Taco Bell drive thru really quickly figuring that it wouldn't be that bad after two years and to give them another chance. \n\nI understand that things aren't optimal right now for them to say the least, so I wasn't concerned about time at all.

Light, maybe semi-healthy, tasty (after adding hot sauce.)  Then I had to try their \"naked chalupa.\"  Not even sure what it was, I went ahead and ordered.  It's like KFC's Double Down: a chicken breast molded into taco shape, deep fried.  It actually held up really well as a vessel for the other ingredients, tasted good, and didn't seem greasy or nasty (though I'm sure it is both.)

The order screen hasn't worked for more than 3 months. The restaurant always seems to be understaffed and less than capable of running a business. On my last visit 2 weeks ago I waited over 15 minutes in the drive through and my order was wrong. My quesadilla was overcooked and was not cut. The nachos looked like they were made by a child and the gentleman that took my credit card for payment was wearing rubber gloves and was working on the food line. He did not change gloves between the car in front of me and me which tells me he was handling money and touching food without hesitation. I typically don't complain but enough is enough. This restaurant is filthy when I've gone inside and the service/food quality is always sub par. On the visit tonight I was told to look at the menu while they were catching up. There was only once car ahead of me. I was also told the they were out of beef and that it would be a 30 minute wait for it to be done. Therefore I ordered the #7 combo with a chicken quesadilla and a chicken soft taco. I also ordered a steak quesarito and a Mountain Dew Baja blast to drink. After waiting 5+ minutes for the vehicle ahead of to receive their order I approached he window. I waited 3+ minutes to be greeted by the employee. I could see from the window that the drink they filled was dark and not Baja blast. When they finally came to the window they asked if I would like sauce, after I requested fire sauce I asked if the drink that was poured was Baja blast. The woman answered no and that they were out of Baja blast. She then proceeded to pour Baja blast into a cup and drank it herself to see if it was carbonated. She mentioned that the drink they poured for me was Pepsi and that the Baja blast hadn't been working? She then gave me a half filled cup of Baja blast. When I finally received my food I checked to make sure that everything was there as I typically do. I opened the soft taco expecting chicken, I added the fire sauce and took a bite. I was highly surprised to A. Find beef in the soft taco and B. Discover that the beef was ice cold and uncooked. The entire soft taco was frozen and inedible. I'm assuming they rushed the beef to the line even though it wasn't cooked despite the fact I requested chicken. The quesadilla was also overcooked once again with minimal chicken and once again not cut into quarters. The queasarito was warm at best and with minimal meat. Again I reiterate I typically never complain but after multiple bad experiences at this location I feel it should be made known. The order screen not working, inattentive employees, incorrect orders, overcooked/undercooked food, filthy restrooms at my in lobby visits and long wait times at the drive through something needs to be done. I don't expect 5 star service at Taco Bell at 11 pm however I do expect the screen to be functioning, correct orders, the food to be  cooked properly and all menu items to be available. Not to mention the foul odor of sewage while sitting in the drive through. I'm going to be placing this review on Yelp because I wouldn't want someone else having the same poor experience that I've had the past several months. Shame on me for continuing to frequent this location and expecting different results.

I use the term \"kiki\" since Brian informed me of its use in the Scissor Sisters song (NOT it's origin, as one queen on my Facebook corrected me), and I now think it is a super cute way to say \"party\". We'll see how long that trend lasts.\n\nI first ate at a Taco Bell during the late 90's, around the time they were using a borderline-racist talking chihuahua as part of their advertising campaign. However, I haven't eaten at a Taco Bell since 2004, which remains true to this day. The last time I was in a drive-thru line at Taco Bell, the cute guy I was involved with at the time was upset they had jacked the price of tacos up from $0.99 to $1.09. He refused to pay the extra dime, and he left angry, and without his tacos. It was beyond embarrassing for me, even as a passenger in the car. Since then, I've been extremely uncomfortable anywhere near a Taco Bell, due to that mortifying memory of a certain cute-but-chinchy guy. Still, I sort of miss him; now he's just somebody that I used to know. Oh yeah. I just went Gotye on you. \n\nI almost, ALMOST ordered the Doritos Locos Tacos, just for the sheer novelty of them. And because Catherine T. commented on my check in with simply the words: \"Doritos Locos Tacos\". But when Brian said they were messy, I changed my mind. I wanted to look nice for the kiki...not bloated, and blanketed in Doritos dust.  \n\nBrian ordered a chicken quesadilla. The truck ahead of us ordered God knows what, but apparently they racked up the bill to $25. I suspect that probably purchased one of everything off the menu. At first I thought Brian had been eavesdropping on their order when he told me the amount, until I noticed the large, red, digital sign that displays your order total by the window. If I had any respect for privacy, I'd be a little mad at them blaring your order total to the cars behind you.

Yeah, I know what you're thinkin' - - but Mamacita wasn't around and that's not what I was referring to.  I'm talking about making a run for the border and maybe trying that new Loco Taco or the new Beefy Crunchy Burrito.  \n\nI've been to this location more times than I should, and I've generally had good experiences all around.  At times the service can be inconsistent, and sometimes not that friendly, but the food's solid and consistent and I go in with no expectations on customer service.  At the drive thru a lady starts talking through the muffled speaker and asks for my order.  She is polite and patient as I put in my order for that BCB.  Then she throws in a loop and asks me \"would you like to donate $1 towards my college education?\".  I was like \"WTF?\".  She repeats it and I still can't make it out (due to the muffled speaker) so I tell her I think I'll pass and head up to the window.  Still, the curiosity is getting to me - - I thought she said \"my education\".....turns out, she did.  \n\nAt the Drive Thru window out pops a nice young girl with a big eyes and a pretty smile and greets me w/ a friendly \"hello!\" - she's quite chipper this late at night and she's very polite and courteous, her name is Jessica.  I said she sounded different than the lady on the microphone, her response was that wasn't her, it's her boss Diana R. (does \"R\" stand for \"Ross\"?) and she was in training.  I asked about the $1 donation script - - was that for reals?  \"Yes!\", said Diana Ross, \"it's to help me graduate college w/ my degree, and it's never too late to get your degree!\".  Donna's right - - it's never too late to invest in yourself.\n\n I ask Jessica for elaborate but now there's a queue of cars waiting behind me. Instead of getting stressed out or trying to push my order out asap she patiently explains the details - - the $1 goes into a fund that is used to support those who are going to college.  I ask how it's going - she said it's \"so-so\", and if I'd like it to go to Diana Ross then I just need to sign my name on this form and put her down.  Sounds like a good investment to me, I'll pitch in.  \n\nHad Jessica not been so nice and patient and courteous during that transaction, I would have likely not donated anything or even asked about it.  Just think if we had more people like Jessica and Diana Ross - who were kind, patient, courteous, and professional - it would be a much better place.

(sorry we wanted to give you more business- wont happen again (probably will tho because food is good and i am desperate)) but we weren't rushing them, they were rushing us and really made us feel bad for ordering food? talked to us like it was an inconvenience to their day, and thats relatively how you're always treated. at one point they even told us to stop ordering and pull forward and when we pulled up the cashier looked pissed at us, half ass yelled at us, and gave us the wrong order entirely and literally didn't give a single shit. Would've gone back if I didn't think I'd get punched, order was so fucked up. Also, the speakers are absolutely terrible so they never know what you're saying and you never know what they're saying. Order wasn't even that big, they were just incapable of listening through the speaker and communication was really bad. And if they talk fast you're fucked, cause in my experience they don't slow down for you, and get annoyed when you ask them to repeat it. If you're socially anxious, this is eternal prison. Sucks that it was mostly the employees that ruined it though, we weren't being impatient, didn't mind waiting- as it wasn't their fault. But the employees do not extend that recognition to you. I think if we were older we would've been treated with more respect, but we also shouldn't be treated like trash just cause we probably won't flip out about it.

Hopefully the manager figures something out because not being able to get a refund on over 25 dollars of food is ridiculous.

My family and I went to the drive thru to order some lunch the day before easter. We asked for a minute to get our kids orders ready and the lady (valentine g) was very rude.

We pulled up to the second window and were asked if we wanted sauce. At this time I realized I ordered the food for my children and forgot about myself. We asked to add a taco and she was visibly more angry. She took the credit card from my husband and yelled into the cooks that she needed another taco. Then proceeded to throw bag after bag of food in our car window at my husband. When she gave him the drinks she put his card on top of one of the drinks and rudely just said \"card\" like we are supposed to know she wasn't going to just hand it to us and put it on top of our drink instead. After we received the last taco we ordered we started to leave the parking lot when I realized my children did not get their drinks. We went back and rather than dealing with her in the drive thru I decided to go inside and talk to the manager about the drinks and the customer service his staff was giving at the drive thru. He seemed complete unfazed by what I had to say. While getting the drinks for my children he had to remind his staff to get back to work and take orders at the drive thru. Also valentine decided to hide behind the kitchen equipment while her other coworkers came around the corner trying to see who was talking to their manager about their customer service. All the manager had to say at that point was have a good day and sorry for the inconvenience. None of it was sincere, it was like he didn't even care that his staff could be so rude and unprofessional. I understand this is fast food but if you don't like your job then maybe you shouldn't work in fast food or customer service.

Perhaps in a moment of panic, my order (A number ten (10) combo) was slightly obscured, and rather than successfully getting the aforementioned Doritos\u00ae version of the Gordita Crunch, I was instead placing an order for a plain Cheesy Gordita with two FIERY DORITOS\u00ae LOCOS TACOS accompanying it, along with a large (20 fl oz) beverage. \n\nImpressions:\n\nAfter getting over the initial confusion and perhaps disappointment of the received order, I decided to make the best of a bad situation and begin the ritual application of Taco Bell hot sauce. As a purveyor of all spicy foods, I of course defaulted for the spiciest available variety of sauce, which is named Diablo, as to elicit images of Satan himself. When I imagine a top-tier sauce, I picture something that could double as a chemical warfare agent outlawed by the 1977 Geneva Protocol, a sauce that would send pain through every exposed membrane of the body, a concoction so powerful the human tongue would recoil as if bit by the most venomous of snakes (The Inland Taipan, incase you were curious). I assume purely for purposes of liability, this is not the case, and while the diablo sauce delivered a pleasant level of spice, it was by no means the masochistic experience I had wished for \n\nI started with the Fiery Locos Tacos, and upon examining the first one, found them to be well balanced, but delicate. The shell, a vibrant red, was flavored with a spicy chili-esque powder, giving hints of lime, and filled with ground beef, lettuce, and shredded cheddar cheese in successive layers. My first bite was met with a sense of relief, the taco was crispy, the ingredients were hot, and the lettuce was even, dare I say, fresh(?).  I administered a few Diablo sauce packets which complemented the seasoned shell quite well, and within minutes had consumed both of my hard-shell tacos. \n\nI moved on to then what was to be the crown jewel of the meal, the Cheesy Gordita Crunch Wrap.Like an Arkansas wedding, this smashing together of two closely-related entities produced a surprising mutant offspring, but in this case, it was met with salivation and enjoyment. The Cheesy Gordita Crunch concept is nothing new, but captivated my interest for its complex taste built upon a fairly straightforward platform. \n\nAt this point I realized the key to Taco Bell's success lies within a simple psychological principle. Throughout the meal I felt a sense of nostalgia, as familiar tastes and textures of elementary school lunchroom food wafted through the air. It has been theorized that smell (and therefore, taste) have perhaps the strongest connection to memory than any other sense the human body possesses (Willander, J., & Larsson, M., 2006). It is perhaps this aspect of the human condition, our existential need for truth and reverence through the lens of our childhood experiences, which is reenacted but only for a moment, by the ground beef and Dorito flavored taco shells before is. The pressures, expectations, and formalities of the adult world temporarily disappear, as it is quite impossible with any semblance of maturity to eat a red-dyed taco out of a paperboard holder and feel serious about the whole ordeal. For $1.79 (plus applicable state and/or local meal tax) you too can relive your glory years, when the hardest decision of the day was which side of the playground smelled the worst. \n\nThe Gorditas biggest strength turned out to also be its largest weakness. While the taco shell and soft taco outer layer provided excellent texture and axial rigidity, this massive outer layer absorbed much of the inner flavor, like a protective sheath of cheesy tortilla, and provided a seemingly bland overall flavor compared to the Fiery Tacos which I had consumed prior. Had I ordered correctly, I would have been treated to a Fiery taco within the Cheesy Gordita Crunch Wrap, and this may have remedied this whole blandness situation. \n\nAt this point I felt two things: The first being that even after my triple-taco spread, I was still hungry, and the second, that I had an editorial obligation to provide a review consistent with a wide spectrum of menu offerings, and to get below the surface to really discover what Taco Bell is all about. I boldly returned to the counter and placed an order for a Crunchy Cheesy Core Burrito, which promised a cheddar filled center, the internal crunchiness of seasoned chips, and a soft steamed burrito exterior. In what seemed like only seconds I was handed a bag containing my final challenge, a foil-back paper wrapper holding the creation, initially surprised by its weight and size in my hands. \n\nTo Be Continued...", "date": "2016-08-31 18:49:26"}, {"review_id": "z-16lnZjZ74BQ6hwn7HOoQ", "user_id": "JM_JfYRtTIBc42zHSRgsrA", "business_id": "Gz48AcJa_iMyHmA96vxwWA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 6, "funny": 3, "cool": 1, "text": "The only two taco bell locations in the entire Boston area are here and NEU's main student center.\n\nNEU's taco bell is good but they only have limited options to choose from and they don't serve chalupas.

I have only been thinking inside the bun lately; too much Americana on the mind at a time when isolationism seems more pleasant than the alternative. And fourthmeal? As forgotten as the naivete of our youth. What I can say is that it is always an experience when our post-divorce paths cross in the distant badlands, the nexus of drinking about you and not being able to find any other eateries open as late that enthuse me even a little bit, like a gas station burrito, I would always return to you over that option.\n\nAt the juncture of our latest fond encounter I was taken aback. This was the first time, across the wide and disparate lands, that the guy taking the order through the squawk box asked me if I wanted to donate to charity. At no other Taco Bell has this happened. I did not know if this is a new Taco Bell thing; or just that one. I find it mildly humorous that like many people, I was in the drive thru late in the evening because it was cheap, as in I did not have a lot of money but I could still eat like the King of the Peasants awash in my wealth of cheaply priced tacos. That demographic of your drive thrus, especially in the late evening, I would not think is going to be among the big contributors to that enterprise. Shaking down an investment banker or oil & gas person, that is a different story. They are assholes, excepting Warren Hellman, but they have the money to fix all the root causes of feigned evil and evil-in-fact. But your typical Taco Bell customer? No. We're not seeking authentic Mexican cuisine; we are broke and need cheap tacos. So I will be interested to see if this was an isolated incident; or if this is a new chain thing you are rolling out across the board, like fourthmeal or think outside the bun. \n\nP.S.

He asked if there was anything else and I replied with a yes and tried to carry on with my order. After everything I ordered, he said,\"do you want anything else?\", not can I get you anything else. I did have one more item that I wanted to order and I did. I ordered a Burrito Supreme. Well, the number one has a Burrito Supreme and he rudely said, \"another one?\", like I was some sort of pig or something. His demeanor was awful. This is the manager we are talking about here. This man need not be in customer service, he should be in an office or on the assembly line (firing). When I asked for a few more hot sauce packets, he practically threw them at me.

I pulled back thru the drive thru, was met at the first window this time by a wonderfully nice man that not only had what was missing from our order ready, but at his own doing, threw in 2 empanadas for us.

The last four times we have gone through the drive through, our food has been smashed, missing items, and the special items without onions were not labeled so eating the food is an  allergic guessing game. The times that I called to tell them we were missing items, they said just tell us when you come back through that you are owed items. We did. The person at the drive through said that without a managers name and written information, they would not do that. The person started to get really upset and we just gave up. Today, we walked in and ordered. There wasn't anyone at the counter so we ordered from the order computer. The good thing about that was we could specify no onions. They took Apple/google pay.

I immediately declined because I didn't want to pay nearly $2 for one bottle of water.  We told her we were going to take the food to go instead, since we couldn't get any water. \n\nAs we waited for our food, I saw a stack of cups on the counter near the register.

I actually thought about grabbing 2 of those cups to get my mom and me some water, but I didn't. \n\nThe lady with the headset quickly recalls our order out loud, drops our food bag onto the counter and yells \"thank you very much!\" AS SHE IS WALKING AWAY FROM THE COUNTER!! She recalled our order so quickly that it all sounded like one long sentence and my mom and I didn't understand her at all. I actually had to yell to catch her \"what was that last order??\" She came back and repeated it a little slower but still walked away in the same fashion. I'm irate at this point, but chose to stay calm because of my mom. There was a third female standing behind the counter when the one with the headset did this. I kindly asked her for mild sauce. She gave me a blank stare, but one of the other customers pointed me in the direction to get my own sauce.

When we arrived it was 1:55 am. There looked to be a transient male pedestrian at the drive up menu where orders are placed. We waited. And waited. And waited. at 2:15 am my husband decided to walk up to the drive through window and see what was holding things up and why we had not even been acknowledged. As if waiting for that exact, perfect moment to attack, the female inside lashed out at my husband verbally and when he began to walk back to the vehicle she became louder & more offensive and literally began to come through the window towards us.

Taco Bell.\n\nOk, if you're expecting gourmet food, this is definitely not the place to come to.  Taco Bells are known for coming up with inexpensive fast quasi-Mexican food.  I had a work colleague who was born and raised in Mexico City.  He never moved from there, but he visited the US a few times.  When I visited Mexico for a work assignment, Carlos decided to take me to one of the best taco restaurants in Mexico.  While we were waiting for our food to be served, I asked him what his favorite American fast food restaurant was, and he answered,\"I love Taco Bell food, because they call it Mexican, but you can't get that food in Mexico.\"  His reply caused my Coca Cola that I was drinking to burst out through my nostrils for the first time ever.  He had me laughing so hard, but he was also serious about loving the food too!\n\nTo be honest, I like Taco Bell's basic three crunchy tacos meal that comes with a drink (iced tea for me).  It brings back good memories of being  in my late teens and just being able to afford to eat at Taco Bell.  lol.  And the tacos still taste the same!  Crunchy hard corn tortillas, with the indescript meat that is easily recognizable by its unique very slightly spicy flavor, crisp shredded lettuce and shredded orange colored cheese tossed on top of the rest of the ingredients like they were trying to hide something (most likely the indescript  meat).  Life was so much simpler then.\n\nSo, fast forward to today.  I used the Taco Bell phone app to order the meal, and told the voice coming from the drive thru speaker that I was there to pick up my mobile app order.  Even though there were four cars ahead of me, it took probably 5 minutes for me to get to the window, which I felt was great!  The three crunchy tacos meal is still the same as it always has been, flavor wise.  Fast ordering, fast line for fast food.  The only thing that I could complain about was that I had ordered unsweetened iced tea but was given sweet iced tea.  It was ok with me, though, because this sweet tea was not sickening sweet.\n\nI don't know whether or not sitting indoors is an option.

Once I got into an argument with the manager and he acted like he has these conversations every day... somehow I believe he does.  Avoid this location if you don't like being ripped off.

The last four times we have gone through the drive through, our food has been smashed, missing items, and the special items without onions were not labeled so eating thee food is an  allergic guessing game. The times that I called to tell them we were missing items, they said just tell us when you come back through that you are owed items. We did. The person at the drive through said that without a managers name and written information, they would not do that. The person started to get really upset and we just gave up. Today, we walked in and ordered. There wasn't anyone at the counter so we ordered from the order computer. The good thing about that was we could specify no onions. They took Apple/google pay. Our no onions burritos were in a SEPARATE bag! That made us so happy. When we got home and went through the bags, we were only missing one item. That's better than last time. The food was hot. So, previous visits would have earned them a 1, since I don't appreciate people accusing us of lying about missing items and that all the food was mixed up in the bags, but they have redeemed themselves. We know which items were onion free and were only missing one item this time. \n\n\nI am updating the review because this visit is back to the normal Taco Bell experience. Food was not labeled.

The main reason I'm writing a review is to keep people AWAY from this location. \n\nFirst, the drive thru is SLOW. The reason it's slow is their customer service. The employees at this location simply don't care. Usually Taco Bell employees are timed on how long they take to serve each customer. They don't seem to follow those guidelines at this location. Multiple times I've received the wrong order. Multiple times I've received bad customer service. More than once I've spent my entire 30 minutes break sitting in the drive thru. Once I heard the employees talking amongst themselves. They must have used 5 curse words while I was sitting at the window. I don't care about cursing, but I work in customer service. Extremely unprofessional.\n\nThe second and most important reason you shouldn't go to this location...they've made me sick TWICE. I work near this Taco Bell and my coworkers told me not to go here. They've all been sick at least once, some of them twice from this place. The first time I didn't follow their advice and ended up on the toilet all night. I thought it was a coincidence. Tonight I went for the first time in months. TMI, but I have horrible diarrhea and vomiting now. This is FOOD POISONING. I've had food poisoning twice in my life and it has been from this place. I noticed they cut corners when it comes to customer service. It makes you wonder how many corners they cut when it comes to cleanliness and proper food handling.\n\nTomorrow when I feel better, I will be reporting this place.

I've gone there twice now, and it wasn't just the stupid girl in the drive through that ruined it the first time.  Apparently none of the employees are all that bright.\n\nThe first time I was there, this girl was chatting up an Asian girl at the window.  She kept talking about her brother and some situation.  She NEVER said ANYTHING to me.  Not even my total.  She just took our card since it was already in my hand... And then continued to talk about her brother's habits.  I think the Asian girl could tell I was annoyed and that this other girl was doing everything the wrong way, but it's not like she did anything to fix it.  I heard her tell the girl to ask me what kind of sauce we wanted, but the other girl was still talking about her brother, so I just told the Asian girl, \"Mild and Verde.\"  Lucky us, they gave us two packets of each sauce for our three meals.\n\nThe second time, our three meals got three packets of verde and three packets of mild sauce.  So they're obviously sauce squaters at this particular Taco Bell.  And the girl at the window was alright.  She was decent in speed AND apologized for our wait... But then she forgot part of our order.\n\nI had to go in to get the rest of our order because my biggest peeve about Taco Bell is eating it cold since it also instantly gets soggy.  I go in and this guy at the counter actually talks in slow motion. TALKS IN SLOW MOTION.  So while he's taking this girl's order, I'm standing in line angry.  This lady rolls up to the counter to complain about her empanada being cold in the middle, waits there for less than a minute, and someone from the back comes up and helps her, but pays NO attention to me... The person that was waiting there long before this lady.  Sorry I'm not in a scooter for being obese, Taco Bell, but I need service too.\n\nNow Slow Motion Man finally gets back to me.  He didn't say anything, so I said, \"I just went throught he drive-thru and you forgot part of my order.\"  So he's like, \"Oh, what's do you want?\"  And being a smart alec, I said, \"At least the Taco Pizza I ordered.\"  Then he's like, \"Oh.... Let me see your reciept and your bag.\" So he goes through my bag and reads my reciept in slow motion.  Seriously?  You forgot my order and now you're stalling even longer?  Then he went to the back and tried to yell a new order at them to make a fresh taco pizza.  She just forgot it, bro.  Maybe you should go to the window where it's sitting.\n\nThe girl realized she had forgot it and brought it towards the counter when she was like, \"Oh, I forgot this, is she here?\"  Yeah, I'm here watching these idiots fumble around.

I was ignored for a few more minutes before a manager logged into to the register, told someone it was okay, and after a while, someone took my order.\n\nThe real kicker came when I tried to pour myself some iced tea.  The spout came off and tea started shooting everywhere--over me, over the floor, over everything. I yelled for help, and an off duty employee who was hanging out in the dining room rushed in to stick his finger in the spout. He told me to tell someone what happened. I called for help, and someone did come to rescue the guy's finger from the iced tea container. I then went to the counter to ask for iced tea figuring they had some by the drive through, and considering the circumstances, they would be willing to at least pour me a cup.  The guy asked me if the tea got all over me. Yes, it did. I asked if I could get iced tea from the drive through line. I was told no.  No apology, no tea, no offer of help of any sort... just no.\n\nSo I was ignored, and I got drenched with iced tea. There was no apology or even an offer to pour me some from the drive through container, and basically nothing.... I do appreciate the fact an off duty employee saved me from my iced tea shower, and another employee did fill my cup with what she was emptying from the defective container.... but I do think my experience could have been much better.\n\nI threw out my iced tea drenched receipt, so I won't be able to fill out my survey, but I will probably contact corporate because this was ridiculous.  But whoever stuck his finger in the iced tea container should be thanked.  He told me it was the second time today the spout came off, so get that thing fixed!", "date": "2018-05-05 04:53:57"}, {"review_id": "1hYdx2z7tOxUZSR4TIeD6A", "user_id": "NtLTKEy7bQyejgHnT9JpBA", "business_id": "DN_GtUrFboam4vo6yHmAPw", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I was driving by and I was starving. \nSo, I found myself inside this Taco Bell.\nTerrible. \nAt least their prices reflect their quality.", "date": "2010-09-11 19:16:46"}, {"review_id": "uOz17VcTR6j2BsGMafSOhQ", "user_id": "kpzVszK4oVmcmg3yL8dT-Q", "business_id": "ISKKywD0wZeoXyOLf5CU1w", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "All-star Taco Bell experience!\n\nI've passed through here several times now while traveling on 71 and the service is always very friendly, fast and accurate.

I guess I had just seen one too many Doritos Locos Tacos commercial, lol, so I was like eff it... let's see what the hype is about.\n\nInitially, I wanted to go to the Taco Bell off Howell Mill, since it has slightly better reviews, but traffic was kind of bad so I went to the one on Ponce, which is closer\n\nI go through the drive-thru, order my taco, \"one doritos locos taco please\" \"yes, just one sir, no, not the supreme\" \"mhmm, that's all\" \"thanks\". I ate the taco as I drove back  down Ponce to go home, and I must say it was pretty darn good. Hot, crunchy, and the cardboard wrapping for the taco was nice b/c it kept the taco neat and easier/less messy to eat. \n\nIn fact, I went again the next day and ordered the regular crunch taco (99 cents) and the doritos locos taco (1.39) to compare. And again they were both hot and tasty. (Not much difference in taste btw, except for the Doritios one is just a little cheesier and crunchy). The second time around there was a line, which made it sort of slower, but I didn't mind since I was in no rush. Plus, I think they might be taking the advice of their customers and making the items fresh b/c everything did taste quite fresh. I didn't feel bad afterwards or anything... a taco bell taco is definitely much better than a burger from mickey d's (which always leaves you feeling like crap). \n\nSUMMARY: All in all my two consecutive experiences were pretty good. The people were nice, food was fresh, price is good, the line can be a little slow, but I think its because they make it fresh. I will add that I've only gone during \"after work\" hours  (3:30pm-6:00pm), so I don't know if that makes a difference in service and food quality or not. I went into it with little to no expectations, besides I'm a Willys/Chipotle kind of girl so I knew this would not compare.... to my surprise the tacos were good.

Of course, most of their \"specials\" just use their same everyday ingredients in different configurations. . .usually either chicken, ground beef, or steak with either soft or crunchy tortilla, different variations of lettuce, tomato, cheese, sour cream, or beans, etc, etc.  But, still, it's always kind of amusing to see what they come up with!  Today, the current special was the \"Loaded Taco Burrito\" with \"Double Beef\". The picture of it on their menu board looked good, so I ordered one.  Well, mine turned out not to be \"loaded\", didn't have \"double beef\", and it certainly looked a lot more meager than the one pictured on their menu.

Something has changed. The food has often been a little iffy here, but the staff made up for it. The order/window staff are still stellar, but whoever is managing this place has severely dropped the ball. The last three times in a row that I have been there the drive through has been 15 minutes plus to get food. It is the type of entry that once you get in you can't get out so you are a prisoner once you make the mistake of getting in line. It is so bad that people are honking horns and turning off their cars and this is in non-rush times as in my last visit was at 2:45pm on a Sat. not lunch, not dinner, and didn't get out until 3pm. It is all on the crew responsible for making the orders and I have been told they are short staffed now (for weeks).\n\nThe food quality has dropped again (it sort of goes up and down here from my experience over the years) the beans taste bad like they have changed something on them or in them. Not spit it out of your mouth and get sick bad, but bad enough that on my last three orders I haven't finished one of the bean burritos I've ordered. In some cases I have thrown full burritos away because the first one was bad enough I tossed it so that I didn't even want to try another bite of the second one.\n\nEons ago I worked at a Taco Bell, so I know what they go through, and I know how long it is supposed to take and what constitutes a \"rush\" of customers/orders. I know what the food is supposed to taste like. This isn't on the window guys, it is up to management to adequately staff and train the food prep crew. They fell down on this and I can't recommend anyone go here at all unless they make some serious changes to get back on track. If they don't get their act together they are going to lose their best people and that will drive away regular customers. I'm not coming back until I hear about them making a change to fix whatever they broke. I can get served faster in any of the sit down Mexican restaurants around here and get better food. That is what I suggest you try or hit up one of the other Taco Bell locations and try your luck there.

I normally go during the day to evening and use the drive through. I don't know how they manage to keep hiring such great people! There always seems to be a good energy every time I get to the window.\n\nThe food is the food. For a while there was an issue with the beans not being cooked right so some were crunchy. The service was so good I kept coming and it has been over a year since I've had any food quality issues. I have called their corporate office more than once to compliment them. This place is like therapy, if I'm having an off day I can count on them to have a genuine smile and do their part to make it a great fast food experience.\n\nFast food is normally thankless and often involves dealing with customers that are rude and condescending. I hope this store has weeded out the bad customers by now because they really are that good. It really does spoil you for going to other locations because you are lucky to get average service from average workers that are just doing a job. Customer service and the way you treat people really does matter. I have been coming here for years and the quality of people has been the constant that keeps me coming back and wishing all fast food places had staff like this.", "date": "2015-09-21 19:03:43"}, {"review_id": "RUo3pnOAL8hykU1pjGM4LA", "user_id": "yP071xRuTHgteTER_rSdJA", "business_id": "gOkP_T26KVtqAO6ANE-gPw", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "It was pretty good for the most part.

This Taco Bell competes with lots of fast food type places in the food court within the Florida Mall: it serves up industrially manufactured, highly processed, and cheap food at its worst; no thank you - I had the soft taco option and there were three of these things in a portion, each was individually wrapped in its own little paper bag and all placed inside a bigger paper bag. The diet coke served up was flat. This food had no discernible smell nor did it have any detectible texture. It was lukewarm food too. The bits of grated, orangey cheese were rubbery and completely devoid of taste, I mean cheese is meant to have a taste, the sour cream was served in a tiny paper pot and priced at 59 cents was  more like plain yoghurt and the guacamole also at 59 cents served in a small paper pot just tasted metallic, it certainly didn't have an avocado taste. I suppose the only positive with Taco Bell is that it's cheap.

I know what to expect from a typical fast food restaurant, but this is worlds worse than your typical \"slow service\" or \"slightly wrong order\". I typically order a cheese quesadilla and I have started to, after many times of not receiving it, asking at the drive-thru, \"please make sure to not forget the creamy jalapeno sauce that comes on the quesadilla.\" A cheese quesadilla from taco bell comes with shredded tri-blend cheese and a slightly spicy, creamy sauce called \"creamy jalapeno sauce\". You'd expect that with only two ingredients aside from the shell, this is the least likely order to mess up, right? Wrong. 90% of the time I receive a horrendously burnt quesadilla with maybe 40% of the shredded cheese that should be on there scantily filling only the middle two slices of the fold. It's fucking gross. Like, how lazy must one be to forget an entire third of the ingredients of a quesadilla? You can also expect, if ordering more than one item, to not receive an item or to receive an entirely wrong order about 50% of the time. Driving back around a second time to correct the order is not only time consuming because they have such slow service, it's also REALLY ANNOYING because good luck trying to explain to your half-competent drive-thru attendant about the order they messed up a mere 5 minutes ago (if you're lucky to get through that quick). Most of the time, the \"corrected order\" they give you has some problem of its own, is given to you with the worst attitude, and comes only after a hassle of an argument during which you hopelessly try to convince the person at the window that you are right and they are wrong. Seriously unless you're a common customer here and know how to swing the ropes of dealing with their bullshit, just steer clear, because you will likely leave with a high risk of anger induced stroke and may certainly have one after ingesting your greasy, burnt order. Also would like to note, I tried to contact Taco Bell customer service about this location but was unable to voice my complaints. This taco bell really is the butthole, hell's end of all of the Taco Bells across the country.

BUT what really got me was that these people had paper plates and we're going around by themselves making plates of food for themselves. THATS SO UNSANITARY!! All of this happened while talking to workers in the back as if it were completely normal. There even was a guy who had a phone call so he walked out to the lobby to take the phone call and then once it ended he walked back into the back with the workers... This all was absolutely crazy but what really bothered me was that the workers were so distracted they took forever to get orders out, getting orders wrong, and not putting complete effort into there work. There was a huge line gathered waiting for food. Then, they got orders wrong. PLUS watching them making watermelon freezes and literally pouring the seeds to the bottom and filling it up and putting it out.

I saw this and promptly went and spoke to the night manager who had come in and assumed duties for the evening.

My other family members decided to go somewhere else to eat in the food court.  I choose Taco Bell.  I ordered my food with a friendly female cashier, who fixed my drink.  As I was waiting, I noticed people that had ordered after me, getting their food.  Still, I was being patient, afterall it's the holidays.  After 10 minutes, I asked the guy handing out food if mine was about to be ready (by the way, several times just calling out names and handing bags to wrong people because he wasn't looking in the bags after calling names. At some point, I noticed what might look like my food but I don't know because I don't work there!!!). He asked what I ordered and said, \"he got me\".  I wait another 5 minutes, then tell him that if it's not being made, please cancel my order. Also, told him I thought I seen what looked like my order but someone else grabbed it when he called her name. He said, \"why didn't you say anything?\" Again, I don't work here!! How would I know!?! He goes back to the left side of kitchen and tells the lady expediting what the issue is, this time where I clearly see he does. She's asked me, \"what did you order and where is your receipt?\" My receipt was behind the cups, that was behind the register. After ordering it fell so I just left it there.  I told her where it was and she didn't grab it. She said, sternly \"your food is almost ready.\"  I said, \"really at this point I just want my money back.\" She made it clear I was getting my food. At this point, we are 20 minutes in. The rest of my family was almost done eating.  I wait another five minutes and no food. This time I told the female expeditor on left that I demand my money back! A lady from the right side of the kitchen, I'm assuming the manger comes out and says \"what's your problem here?\" I explain to her how long I've waited and just at this point I want my money back! She asked me for a receipt, I told her where it was. She asked, \"why is it over there!\" Really?? What does it matter at this point, just grab it and look. Anyhow, after a 10 seconds of explaining why, she grabs it and says is your order \" tostada and what sounded something like about 'potatoes\"? I had a tostada but idk what the potatoes is, she said I can't give your your money back without receipt. I asked her can I look at the receipt, she said, \"what exactly did you have on your order?\" I told her again and she said yea this is your receipt but your food is almost ready!\" By the way another five minutes goes by and my food isn't even in a bag. I made it clear again, I just want my money back!! My drink was on the counter, I had my hand on it but not a grip.  She snatches the cup away from me (grazing my hand btw) throws it in the trash!!! WTF JUST HAPPENED HERE?!?!(normally, I wouldn't cuss on a review but really, wtf did she just do!?!) I said, \"that was rude!\" She states, \"well, you wanted a refund, right!?! I made it very clear by choice words that was unacceptable!! \n\nWhat should have happened because I waited over 25 minutes and because it was such and issue....I should have left there  with my food, my money given back to me and my drink refilled! Or I would have accepted just my money back, no food and to not have my drink snatched from me!! I worked in the food industry for over 25 years!! This is unacceptable!! The woman who snatched my drink to trash it, be glad my kids were there and your not worth jail time! Walking away from that counter with tears in my eyes because I was so mad and praying to GOD he give me the strength to just keep walking was definitely his grace working. I'm not even a believer!

While the food I had at this Taco Bell was okay (by Taco Bell standards), I do not recommend visiting this location. For a better, safer Taco Bell dine-in experience, go to one of the next nearest locations. I suggest the store at 1761 Howell Mill Rd NW.\n\nMy friends' parents were mugged in the parking lot here. Also, when I was waiting for my order, I watched several neighborhood kids walk into the store, with various sized empty cups, and steal soda from the fountain machine. They snuck out with huge grins on their faces. I'm not sure if the employees saw or even cared and it didn't look like it was the first time these kids had done it either. The neighborhood immediately to the south and east are historically known for high crime and drug activity, so the aforementioned incidents didn't surprise me in the least.\n\nI grabbed my lunch order to go. It consisted of my old reliable Taco Bell favorites: soft tacos and chalupas. Since the Doritos Locos tacos came out, Taco Bell's taco lineup has ballooned to over a dozen different tacos. Soft, crunchy, beef, chicken, double decker, etc. Through the years, I still prefer the taco I loved in third grade: soft taco with beef. In third grade, I could eat six of these in one sitting.\n\nThe soft taco with beef comes with seasoned ground beef, shredded lettuce, and cheddar cheese in a soft flour tortilla. There's also a soft taco \"supreme\" option that adds diced tomatoes and sour cream, but I still prefer the plain version. I like to add about a pack of \"fire\" sauce to each soft taco. I'll finish one in about four bites.\n\nTaco Bell's chalupa is like a soft taco on steroids. I prefer the chalupa over the gordita because of the chalupa's crispier, tastier (and greasier) shell. The chalupa comes with seasoned ground beef, shredded lettuce, three cheeses, diced tomatoes, and sour cream. Not surprisingly, it packs a bigger punch than the regular tacos (and about twice the calories).\n\nService I experienced at this location was fine.", "date": "2016-03-27 13:38:29"}, {"review_id": "_e8mJt-1aVpOSO36y1pT8w", "user_id": "-DEbrtVDPu11Gui41vmg2A", "business_id": "sIb2-T5WIgg61pHzupThdQ", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "I just made an online order from this Taco Bell.

My burrito came out way too quick, and was lukewarm.\n\nYou also had to ask for sauces, which was kind of weak (weak sauces, and in limited quantity). And yes, the inner fillings looked quite sad.

I thought pretty good, I'll order more of these. Ah...but at this taco bell, it is no resemblance whatsoever to what I got at the other taco bell. Just a mess no grilled cheese and loose cheese and goop a total mess. I also order the double shell taco with the soft cheese between the 2 shells for a $1. That is a new special item and I never tried it before so harder to judge but what I got was a mess and no visible cheese seen. It didnt look anything like the photos, nor did the burrito at this location. At this time I already left. You cant eat there. \n    However this is not the worst of it.

I guess from now on you better! \n     The lady who handed me the bag had a mask on, but the folks behind her had the around the neck trick thinking maybe I will only pull it up if people complain? or if I get caught??? Im not sure what the thinking is.  \n   The chairs are also all down and no sign, but if you sit down they will tell you you cant. Ok no indoor eating is  understandable, but most places put the chairs on the table, rope it off, or put up a sign but none of that here. I guess your just supposed to know. I would think we are just supposed to know we should have a mask on to but I guess I hope for too much. \n  There has been a rucus between the Mayor and Governor on masks but the mayors most recent proclamation reads they should be wearing one in ANY building in the City of Atlanta.

It said that they will start making up your order unless you reply to the email and say otherwise. ?  Well I didnt want it to sit and wait and get cold so off I went!

I ordered two double decker tacos, a bean burrito with green sauce no red sauce extra onions (my wife's favorite) an enchilada and a gordita chicken (thinking crunch wrap but said the wrong thing)\n   When my number was called there was one of those twisted cinnamon things sticking out and I said, \"This isn't my order I didn't order that cinnamon thing (a Churro).\"\nI then had the guy who took my order, who I hate to say it but his English wasn't very clear, argue with me looking at the receipt that that was in fact my order. In fact he said that twisty thing is your gordita and I said no I thought the gordita was something else not a cinnamon twist thing I guess its my bad I didn't know what I was ordering I was wanting to order that circular round thing thats wrapped up and has all the stuff in the inside. He says, oh a Crunchwrap I'll get that for you. So I got that for free and took it all home. \n   Well, sure enough on the receipt there is the churro and a gordita special order with chicken. I have a gordito and it's NOT the swirling cinnamon thing and there isn't an enchilada anywhere!?!  I wasn't charged for what I didn't get but I was charged for that twisted cinnamon thing that I didn't order! And I got a free crunch wrap minus the charge on the twisted cinnamon thing that I didn't order but was charged for.\n\nHow screwed up can an order get?

Their customer service is absolutely horrible. What these people need to understand is that there is absolutely nothing convenient about their service.  I would almost be willing to pay a little more to get a better customer experience, but their service is so absolutely fucking atrocious, that it behooves me why I keep going back.  I love the taste of their food, but the fact that I cannot even feel secure in the fact that when I have to walk in EVERY fucking time and tell them that they did not get the order right, something is seriously wrong.  \n      So I go through the drive-thru to order 2 bean and cheese burritos, 1 mexican pizza without tomatoes, and 2 volcano burrito's with extra meat and 10 fire sauces.  I had repeat myself to the lady taking the order literally 3 times to make sure that they got it correct.  Well the way Taco Bell Drive through works is that they do not give you the actual receipt till they give you the food and it is included into the bag.  I never quite understood that as its not like they are not supplied with computers to help them facilitate the oder.  But for some reason the receipt was never given until the food is given to the customer.  That being said, I paid for the food and of course did not get 10 ft before I found out that they did it again!!!  They put tomatoes on the Mexican Pizza.  On top of that they only gave me 1 bean and cheese burrito, but then again they only charged me for 1 bean and cheese burrito.  So I go into the store and walk up to the counter with the issue.  There was this very heavy set woman going behind the counter when I asked her if she was the one that I spoke to over the comm.  Her reply was, \"Do I look like I am wearing a headset?\"  I said, \"Fair enough\" and I asked for the person I was speaking to at.  She came out, and she really didn't say much as I was pretty heated at the time.   The cashier came out, looked onto the receipt and advised me that I never placed the 2nd burrito order.  Also that their sauce on the Mexican pizza comes with tomatoes into the sauce, which BTW when we ordered it without tomatoes, and the fucking sauce did not come with it in it.  Either way he took the pizza back and made another one without any sauce at all.  I mean no sauce!!  Then they gave me an extra bean and cheese burrito and did not charge me for it which was fine, but the fact that they got the order wrong every time is just absolutely baffling.  I mean even based on statistics, they would have had to get it right once maybe every 10 times or so.  That is just not the case.   On top of that they took the receipt from me so I had a serious time just complaining about it.\n     So my wife calls when I get back as I was so pissed off about it, that it was best that she call.  She gets the manager who states that there was no person that came in to complain today to them about this.  It's not like I did not even exist and was refusing to give the number of his supervisor, but at the end of the call we were able to obtain it.  My wife spoke to Eddie who was the supervisor over the store and explained the circumstance, which in the end he just wanted to provide us with free food.  When we complain about something, we do not ask for free food based on the fact that it feels that we get something for nothing.  So she politely declined and explained that when we complain about service, it is not about free food, it is about the customer experience that went so horribly awry, that we felt that we had no other option but to complain to someone about this experience that can do something to change this.  But to be honest, I do not feel that anything in the end will ever change with Taco Bell.  I know it is Mexican food, but the fact that they cannot get one person that can understand or comprehend mathematics or english for that matter is amazing to me.  I apologize that I force them to pull out the ESL (English as a second language) courses, but what is the point when they work in a predominantly English speaking country and cannot comprehend the use of the numeric system in English or what you are actually saying except for key words.  It creates a language barrier as well as a poor customer experience overall.  I hate even bringing up the language barrier, but if there is one in a country where people are supposed to understand English, than why is this happening?\n     I am so fucking done with Taco Bell in Texas.  I love the taste of the food but the serious lack of customer service as well as the lack of consistency from store to store is just horrific.", "date": "2013-08-16 21:25:25"}, {"review_id": "D1pV8moMO49iFa7HfC3gxQ", "user_id": "baUEP3IvWLyYLg6QWuI7KQ", "business_id": "vrc7TzESgKp8ttCv6gfyoQ", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 6, "funny": 2, "cool": 1, "text": "It was so nice having a Taco Bell just down the street... and it was awesome the first week, but ever since it's been a huge disappointment.

It's a facial expression. It's mild dread. It's German Village Taco Bell Employee Face.\n\nWhen a worker (who obviously doesn't want to be there but has checked Instagram 16 times since you made your order) hands you your food from the drive-thru perch, his or her confusion says, \"I'm sorry. Maybe?\" with a nervous energy that is almost palpable. No words are exchanged.\n\nIf you get everything you ordered, it's a success. That look - the confused gaze they give you - seems like they just reached into a trough (see \"NOTE\" at end of review) of Taco Bell food slop and threw random items into a brown paper bag and have their fingers crossed behind their back just hoping against all hope that some of the things they grabbed are things you ordered.  \n\nThere is a mathematical formula when it comes to waiting in line at this drive-thru. Every car (including your own) represents seven minutes of waiting time and ... I've been waiting to use this line ... it's not exactly ... if you've seen 1980s movies where making out in closets happened at every home in a suburban neighborhood you know what's next ... seven minutes in ... yep ... heaven. \n\nLet's say you pull up and you're the only car in line. Whatever you order (be it three tacos and nachos or simply a Mountain Dew Pepsi Freeze Cool Breeze Chiller) you're going to wait seven minutes for your order. If you're pulling up and you see three cars in line (this includes the car at the drive-thru window), you're going to be waiting 28 minutes (three cars and your own ... that's four).  \n\nI don't like reviewing fast food places because judging a place that hires high school kids is patently unfair - but the contrast between this Taco Bell and the Wendy's across the street is stark. Wendy's (whose commercials remind you of annoying people who are looking for excuses to double- and triple-text you like we get it you can be funny but relax for five freaking seconds dude) actually does everything right when it comes to German Village fast food options. Service is impeccable, the drive-thru line moves quickly, it's easy to pay for food (read that again and marvel at its noteworthiness) and you always get everything you ordered.\n\nThe German Village Taco Bell has to be the most horrendously managed fast food place in the country. I get it. Every community has a \"worst\" fast food place that people love to rip on, sometimes unfairly. Not this place. All complaints are warranted. I've lived in German Village since the mid-2000s and this place has remained THEEEEEE worst during that entire period. I'm not entirely sure what is going on. Before writing this review, I noticed some people gave this place positive remarks. These individuals must be actual Taco Bell employees or relatives of management. \n\nYou know how you will sometimes go to a place (German Village Chipotle or German Village Taco Bell) and want to WRITE THAT PLACE A LETTER about how awful everything about it is? Obviously, no one ever actually does that but German Village Taco Bell has pushed me closest to the brink. I just cannot - for the life of me - get over how terrible this location remains. How on earth has there never been a reality show made about fixing this place up?? It's THAT bad. The only thing worse is when you got stuck with a partner who didn't use deodorant or tooth paste in sophomore chemistry in high school when you were SO close to being the guy paired with the hottest chick in the class. It's awful. \n\nLike there should be a show with The Rock (I don't know if he has any fast food experience, I have never read any of his biographies) and The Rock goes into fast food places and gives pep talks and everything turns around and one of the employees turns his or her life around and someone cries at the end during an emotional TESTIMONIAL.\n\nWe all remember December 2015 as the month when \"BOSS NACHOS\" from Taco Bell were all the rage. Will and I used to love going to bars and making an order for \"BOSS NACHOS\" and just seeing what they served us (I miss the nachos at Eddie George's on campus ... too much sour cream, yes, but the overall presentation and taste hit every spot imaginable).\n\nThe Boss Nachos at German Village Taco Bell came in a gigantic garbage-bag looking thing. \n\nTrash. Yes.\n\nNOTE: I had to look up the spelling of \"trough\" on Google and the first thing that popped up were urinal troughs. They are like $1,700 for a low-end model. Seems like money not well spent.

When trying to ask for a refill, I was ignored by the front counter staff. She looked at me and pointedly ignored the fact that I had been standing there for 10 minutes, my boyfriend got mad so he went up to complain and he got help right away. \n\nThere were 4 people working,  one who seemed to be the manager, and 3 other staff who seemed to be flitting from the front to the back. Bad management and bad service.  Stay at the front to help customers, if you're  supposed to be at the front. \n\nDo not go here if you can go to another place to eat.

Taco Bell is the cheapest of the cheap food options in Happy Valley, so my expectations are already pretty low.  Still, it's my go-to fix when I'm craving some of that fast-food flavor we Americans hate to admit that we love.\n\nHere are some of the amazing features you'll find at this particular Taco Bell location.\n\n1) If you eat here, you can claim to be vegetarian.  This is very hip in the Portland Metro area, and the incredibly small amount of meat they put into their food (even by Taco Bell standards) doesn't count enough to qualify you as a carnivore.\n\n2) It's a tremendous time saver.  If you're lucky enough to travel with a barber, you can get a shave and a full-blown haircut while spending 20-30 minutes in the drive-thru line.  Alternative activities include becoming fluent in Polish, or studying to become a nuclear physicist.  \n\n3) You don't have to bother complaining.  The fact that they don't respond to email-based complaints, or essentially ignore concerns raised in the restaurant means that you can get home to shower off all of those loose hair bits instead of waiting at the counter for a manager to show up.\n\n4) It's lower-calorie food as well.  They're usually out of one or two ingredients, so the caloric intake from your meal will be considerably less.  They usually let you know that information after you've paid as well, as opposed to when you're placing your order.  That keeps you from adding additional items that might add to that waistline you've obtained after sitting in your car in the drive-thru line. \n\n5) It also saves you money.  If they were faster or cleaner, I'd probably eat here more often, which would put a small dent in my pocketbook.  Their abysmal customer service keeps me away until that craving for a taco becomes too strong to ignore, and that feeds the bottom line.", "date": "2017-01-31 00:02:49"}, {"review_id": "bPBbARbJcUZF4JONl5O-AQ", "user_id": "L4nt446mo-mxJsS6nt4nZQ", "business_id": "Xpkei8AFVLko9gN5g2xdgg", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Worst Taco Bell on earth.

This is a combination Taco Bell and KFC. Cashier ignored me for two or three minutes before grudgingly asking 'melp you' while looking beyond me into space. I had to repeat my order three times: six crunchy tacos. She kept thinking I was saying 'six soft tacos'. She really seemed like she was someplace else mentally. They got the tacos made fairly quickly, gave it to me in a 'to go' bag, even though I said it was for 'here'. I sat down to eat. The soul/R&B music was cranked up about 50% louder than it needed to be. There was no condiment stand for hot sauce, etc. That is usually a sign that there's a ghetto nearby because hungry 'po people' often visit fast food restaurants and clean them out of any freely available condiments: hot sauce, ketchup, salt, mustard, honey packets, you-name-it.\n\nSo I had to go back to the counter, wait to attract someone's attention because they were all carrying on about something funny in the back kitchen. Finally, a guy saw me and I asked for six mild sauce packets. He came back with a fistful (at least 20) of HOT sauce packets, none of which were mild. OK, so I can eat a taco with no sauce at all, I guess.\n\nI sit down again and open my bag of tacos, and there's only four. I checked my receipt: I paid for six. Again to the counter I went, and this time I didn't bother to politely wait to be noticed. I just loudly called back into the kitchen that I needed two more crispy tacos because they didn't give me enough. A lady came out and I repeated the problem. She nodded in understanding and then waddled back to the kitchen. I told her I was siting near the exit and to bring my tacos out to me. Five minutes later I still don't have my other tacos, so again I go to the counter and another employee is blankly staring into space instead of asking if I need help. I told her I was waiting for two extra tacos and then another lady realized that my tacos were just sitting next to the register. Nobody even thought to bring them out to me. I open up the bag to check and sure enough, another mistake: they were soft tacos, not crispy tacos. I dropped them right back on the counter without a word and went back to eat my last taco. I thought surely some manager would come and ask me what the problem was. Nope. \n\nBy the way, the tacos were terrible. There was only about half the expected amount of meat, lettuce and cheese, and whoever made them slopped meat sauce everywhere on the shells. The shells were cold and somewhat stale. And they wrapped them sloppily so that the contents spilled out.\n\nIf these people can't get make a decent taco to company specs, can't get a simple order right, and don't understand the basics of customer service, why in heck are they employed here? I dealt with four different people while trying to get customer service. Not one of them looked me in the eye. This was the worst Taco Bell I've been to in my life. I should have gone to Panera.

But this particular location is one that I try to stay away from, which is sad because it's the closest one to my house.  \n\nI will say that I have had more terrible experiences here than I have good experiences, and really how hard can it be? \n\nLet's start off with the fact that there is always something that they are out of for the night. Now I'm not talking at 1am after a huge rush of people going home from the bar, I'm talking at 9pm on a Friday or Saturday. And these are not ingredients a Taco Bell can survive without. When you are out of ground beef, chicken, beans, and cheese, you might as well shut the place down. My sister and I went 3 times and every time there was something they were out of. \n\nSecond, the orders are normally wrong, and if they arnt consider yourself lucky. I once stopped on my way home and did not check the bag because honestly you shouldn't have to. When I got home 15 minutes later I realized half the order was gone. I drove back up there and let them know this was the case they made me my \"missing\" items. By this time I had learned to check the bag after pulling forward, and immediately noticed that the order was still not completely there. I pulled back around and sat at the window (inside was closed) and finally, after 5 minutes, someone came to the window. I asked for a manager to personally make my last items as I figured they would at least try to make it correctly.\n\nWhich brings me to my last point. The staff is rude and incompetent. The manager that I spoke to just asked \"Well what do you want me to do about it?\" I wanted to try and be nice because everyone knows a horror story of someone spitting in food, but at this point I was just irritated. I told him that honestly I just want what I payed $20 for so my family could eat dinner. He gave me the rest of my food and lucky for me, provided me a lovely little flier for a \"free\" breakfast item. After reading the flier I realize it's just a normal event they were doing to promote the items and that was for everyone. Gee thanks sir. \n\nSo it's safe to say I will stay away as best as possible until corporate takes action.... Which I seriously doubt they will since everyone in my family has called multiple times to complain and it still remains just as terrible.", "date": "2015-07-10 00:23:35"}, {"review_id": "Yp3Ugv8AhbpIgqrUn90IAw", "user_id": "gEt2b4t34Zz3Q2HzkrT53g", "business_id": "HTazXocegk9oZE1W3qB-Bw", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Consistently the shittiest Taco Bell experience.

On the first, probably about a year ago, I went fairly late to pick up some dinner.  The girl working the drive thru window was very nice, but as I was waiting for my food I witnessed her bend over and proceed to projectile vomit into a garbage can.  I get that people can get ill, but doing it right in front of the window was a little alarming.\n\nThe second issue involved an online order using the Taco Bell app.  I submitted an order and then called the location about five minutes later to verify that it had received it and if the food was ready to be picked up.  The person I spoke with informed me that they hadn't received any orders.  I placed the order again and called back shortly after; same response.  I then checked my bank account online and saw that I had been charged for the order (once).  I called this location back asked to speak to a manager, who apologized and said I would be refunded immediately.  I waited three days or so and still no refund, so I eventually contacted Taco Bell Corporate, who finally granted me the refund.\n\nLastly, this third issue was just last week.  I was on my way to work and stopped to pick up dinner.  As soon as I pulled up to order, a female employee rudely informed me that \"We're out of lettuce, so if you order something with lettuce you won't get any lettuce on it.\"  Very nice.\n\nIt took three strikes, but I won't be back.

We live just down the road on Brodie, and being a Taco Bell lover this is a convenient stop on our commute.  I've lived all over (IN, CA, KY, TX) and have been eating Taco Bell at least weekly for 20 years.  I've had the pleasure of great Taco Bells near me, and a few bad ones.  Most are very predictable.  But never have I encountered a store like this one.\n\nI would be up all night if I were to detail all of the sub-par experiences we've had at this place, so I will just provide some complaints in aggregate.  We've been to this Taco Bell over 50 times in the last year, to give you some context.\n\nNapkins - This is probably the funniest complaint, but it is also sad.  Every time we go through the drive thru, they only give us 1 napkin, even though we order 6 items.  Maybe on 5 occasions we have gotten more than a single napkin.  Since this is always the case, I can only surmise that the manager instructs his employees to skimp on napkins.  There is no way that by chance all of the employees could just be that lazy or careless.\n\nMissing items - On approximately 1 out of 5 visits, you will get shorted at least a single item.  Sometimes we catch it before we leave the window, sometimes we don't.\n\nInconsistent food - The quality and size of the food varies greatly with each order.  Very rarely it is made huge.  Much more often you get items that are only half the size they are supposed to be.  They have very lame skills with the sour cream gun as well.

In fact I could not take any money from my account or I would have. In between pay periods is kind of rough. Anyways, I had silver mainly quarters few dimes and nickels and then three pennies. She was not happy. And again I am so sorry. But it is all I had to scrounge up until  my paycheck would come in and I was very hungry. Anyways the woman very angrily told me here's your order  and here'sYour drink. Shoved them to me. Then slammed the door just so angrily looking at me. I didn't realize when I did it was so terribly wrong. And I feel bad for Taco Bell because this was my favorite place in New Albany to go I lived here for many years. I was just passing by because it was on my route. Again I am very upset to have posted such a low rating but I think No one should judge someone circumstance just because they paid with  change.

Customer service was awful, and I will tell my story here:\n\nSunday April 28, 9:30/10:30 AM. \nI pull up to the drive through and see NOBODY in the parking lot or drive through. I am greeted over the speaker by a woman, and since I have never been to taco bell for breakfast(I know, I'm lame) I ask her \"do you guys have a protein bowl?\" her answer \"no.\" That's it, just a blunt \"no\" and then silence. So I ask \"is there a way I could add egg to the power bowl or maybe substitute for something in the power bowl? Her answer \"I mean...you can add egg on the side.\" After that, silence. I then say to her \"there isn't anyone in line behind me, do you mind if I have a second to look at everything?\" and she doesn't even respond. Typically, I would think a \"sure let me know when you're ready\" or something along those lines would suffice. But instead, she immediately replaced herself with a different guy. Literally maybe 10 seconds after I asked for a second, I hear a male voice say \"what can I get for you today?\" So at this point, I am feeling rushed and I just order random stuff off the breakfast menu that I didn't even want. I pulled up to the window, gave the young man my money, and then was told to wait at the pit for my food. Seconds before I drove away, I looked through the window and literally saw the lady YELL at this guy \"come on! hurry up!\" First of all, that is NOT how you treat your employees. You do not need to yell at them like they are in a sweat shop. When he came over, I asked him what had happened? Because she didn't even give me a response, but just put him on the headset instead? He then told me that she was \"in a bad mood because of stress from the night crew.\" I then responded to him with the fact that I too work in a stressful, fast paced environment and have to deal with hundreds of angry customers in my face daily. Just because you are stressed or having a bad day DOES NOT MEAN YOU TAKE IT OUT ON CUSTOMERS. Also, there was NO ONE in the drive through or parking lot, so it's not like there were a bunch of customers inside or out. I wish I knew this lady's name but her attitude was so awful and I promise you I will just go to the taco bell on 620 in Lakeway instead because they are always very kind and hook it up big time for me with the power bowls! Again, I wound up ordering random stuff I didn't really want. I wasted money and time, and I probably should have just driven away. I hope you can hear me Taco Bell at Four Points, because I am very upset with the way I was treated today. What's funny is, I am never that person to go on a tangent like this unless I find it very necessary. I can't believe this chick is a manager. I will leave with this--the young man whose name I didn't get was a tall brown haired white guy with colored eyes I believe. He was very nice and did nothing wrong. Another time, a young lady with long blonde hair (Chelsea I think?) was so sweet and got my order right!

Hayley's tone of voice was very disrespectful and turned it around on me to make me feel bad. I think Hayley would be better off not working with the public. I've actually heard her curse while taking my order shes whispered \"shit MF,\" You guys should've put a sign out saying \"OUT FOR THE NIGHT\" or something. So I had to spend almost $10. She said she couldn't put the $5 box in a bag because of corporate. And the tacos I got, they were the saddest looking tacos I have ever seen, even my roommate said so. I can't believe she would say for us to go to another taco bell. And I told her I didnt want diablo sauce and I got almost 10 of them. I think she did that to spite me. Cuz I said no diablo please just fire hot and mild and Haley S said, \"ill see what I can do.\" In a super rude tone. Like what is that supposed to mean? It means I didnt want the diablo sauce cuz I dont use it but she gave it to me anyways, pretty much just throwing away money from the company. I checked my food for spit or anything else before eating it. It was easy to check cuz you would think a supreme crunchy taco would be loaded right? You pay the extra money for it, theres like, 6 little tomatoes and I could barely find the sour cream, the taco wasnt even halfway full! This isnt the first time this has happened at this taco bell, sad crunchy tacos that is. I really dont want to drive an extra 3.5 miles to another taco bell but I guess after this last time, it was the last time. Haley S and Samantha,  it doesn't matter if you're having a bad night, leave your problems at home at put on a fake smile on, that's what my managers always taught me. Very dissatisfied and disappointed with Haley S and samantha,  haley and samantha, if you're not happy with your job, then quit. because if you ladies make yourself tacos I'm sure they would be loaded. Your job is to make food like you would want to eat it.

It was close, the Gordita Crunch was made with the wrong shell which is an easy mistake but my Potato Griller was made outrageously small. I almost laughed in my car when I showed my friend it, because there's no way someone can think this is normal.\n\nSo I went inside, where a gentleman from the front desk immediately asked \"Was there something wrong with your order?\" I said yes, took out the two particular items in question, explaining that my Gordita Crunch was supposed to be made with the Doritos Nacho Cheese shell.

If that sounds awkward to you, try being in the car at the time. Moving on.\n\nMinutes (or possibly hours) later, we successfully communicated our desires to the magic food dispensing talking box, which told us to drive up to the window. \n\nThe guy at the window was incredibly friendly, and I briefly considered asking him to be my super best friend, but I then felt that may have been too much of a commitment this early into the relationship. Baby steps.\n\nHe told us our total, and with doe eyes we held out a wad of crumpled bills and some sweaty coins and asked if this was enough to make our stomach hurts go away. \n\"Yes.\" he said, voice shaking ever so slightly. \"Yes it is.\", and cupping his hands together, collected our humble offerings, disappearing into the fluorescent food  palace of salvation.\n\nIt was at this moment that I noticed the huge poster in the window of the Doritos Locos Taco, and because I have the mind of a child, I'm all \"Oh hellz yeah, gotta get me some of that shit!\"\n\nSo as our Mighty Taco Lord came back to give us our change, I ordered one of those too. He wasn't annoyed at this in the slightest, suggesting that either he has kids, or maybe he's actually, for realzies, Jesus. I'm thinking Jesus, because not only did he get me that taco...he said it was on the house, if I just did him a solid and took some survey. \n\nI think thats how Scientoligists get people, but whatever, free taco!\n\nOur order, including my last minute addition, were made exactly as we asked. No tomatoes on my taco, no ice in our drink, everything was perfect. Not only is Taco Jesus super nice, he's also a good listener (ladies).\n\nNot only was everything made to perfection, it was also ready very quickly. Like, seriously. Ninja fast. Everything was done before we even knew it started (uhh...ladies?)\n\nSo would I recommend this place? I'd recommend you thank it for making sunny days and pretty girls every night before you go to bed, fool.\n\nI hope Taco Jesus the Mega Bro reads this so he understands the difference being nice to one person can make.

I couldn't let all of my new Yelp friends know that I was dishonoring the essence of an Orlando foodie by debasing myself to this level with my poor dining choice. \n\nGluttony: As I look over the menu quickly, deciding whether I need not only one but two cheesy gordita crunches this evening, I suddenly realize that there are four employees behind the counter standing around and blatantly ignoring me. I was fascinated by this and became so perplexed that it wasn't until a 5th employee showed up (about 3 minutes after I was standing at the register with my wallet out. No one else in the establishment.) that I realized it was more of an inherent problem at this location and not just me.

She slowly sauntered up to the register while texting on a huge android pone and stood there for another two minutes texting and completely ignoring me. I am not exaggerating. She literally stood less than two feet away, at the register, as I tried to make any sort of eye contact, texting, for two entire minutes. When she finally put her phone down and took my order she got everything into the computer and, before taking my credit card, picked the phone up to send just one more text.\n\nEnvy: Typically I would have walked out after the first 30 seconds of being ignored by the texting wonder but I knew that the story for this Yelp review would be well worth the envy of my colleagues.\n\nGreed: I filled out the survey on my receipt to let Tavo Bell know about the abysmal service I received and then greedily filled out the sweepstakes link to win $500 for my response. It was fulfilling to know that my ire may all be made worth it with my entry into this contest, and I was suddenly pleased and satisfied.

Pulled up. There was a car in front of me at the window. I was posting on Instagram while in line so I checked my post and it was 18 mins ago. Another 10 mins and the car pulls off. When I get to the window it's open and a man I assume is the manager/supervisor in a checkered shirt is talking about \"cleaning Shit\" I'm an adult, I've heard Shit before, maybe he didn't know the window was open. Neither he nor the employee acknowledge me and continue their conversation. Finally they look at me. Not \"hi sorry about the wait\" but turn and look at me  UM OK! Hi, I've been waiting a while and no one said anything and then the lights just turned off so I didn't know if there was something wrong with the system or what. I would've been happy with a rushed passive, \"sorry, what can I get for you\" instead I get a defensive \"that's not us the system does that automatically\" then he turns to another employee and is asking what they have back there, then the employee next to him is pointing at the screen saying \"this person hasn't paid\" and they turn back to me. Um... I hadn't ordered. And neither of them still asked for my order. But when they failed to collect payment from the previous car then they noticed me. Usually this place is fine. I don't know what's up tonight. I can't even be mad at the employee because if they manager is in the window showing such a lack of basic communication skills and lack of customer service then what can I really expect from the team.

It's a pretty sweet deal for us - I email Sam our orders and he brings us a tasty fast food meal! Plus I get to have lunch with my hubs (that's a pretty big plus).\n\nTaco Bell is what it is. For me, it's food that will fill you up quickly and cheaply. The free chalupas from the Blazers when they score over 100 points are particularly nice because (1) they're free, and (2) they remind me of the fun I had watching the Blazers score 100+ points.\n\nFor lunch from here I usually get a chicken soft taco and a crunchy taco. This is an attempt to pretend to be more healthy. If I'm hungrier I'll get the old college standard[1] or I'll add on their cheesy potato things. If I'm not so hungry, I save my chicken soft taco for later and it heats up in the microwave quite nicely. Today, I tried to save, and then reheat, the crunchy taco instead - bad idea (hence the note-to-self). I was not impressed by the volcano taco, by the way.\n\nWhat makes this Taco Bell stand out is that they always include a moist towelette and a mint along with the various sauces, receipt and plea for us to take their survey and win. My question is why only one moist towelette? I think there was only one time last year that we got 2... and we're usually getting food for 2-4 people! Do they think Sam is eating 3 crunchy tacos, a chicken soft taco, a double decker taco, nachos and a cheesy beefy burrito all by himself? Really? He's not a very big guy, nor does he have a tape worm.\n\nSo, it's not usually the best lunch of my week, but the coworkers are happy to have a cheap lunch of reliable (not great, but reliable) quality delivered.

He acted as though I should take pity on him because he only knows the KFC side of the house and knows nothing about Taco Bell and blamed management for not training him.  \nI had to keep asking...and then I got a little ticked as people that ordered their KFC got it and went out the door.

I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the former rattle snake den has been remodeled a bit and looks much better and had some newer and nicer employees.\n\nI was greeted pleasantly and even chatted with by a most personable counter person.  She made sure my order was correct and knew where I could pick it up.  She and the kitchen staff had excellent communication and seemed to get along well and work as a team.

I hope they know they have a gem in this woman.  What a difference!  I enjoyed my food as I always do when needing to feed the craving.\n\nIt's really likely I might not eat Taco Bell for awhile; it's not something I can eat often, strictly an occasional treat.

To a whole new world of yelping. To a tale worth telling.\n\nToday as I walked along Burnside, I saw a middle aged man passed out in the blossoming landscape surrounding Taco Bell. As I walked by, two Taco Bell employees were timidly tapping his foot -- but to no avail. This guy was out for the count.\n\nThe sirens started less than a minute later. (They must have those guys on speed dial!)  As I left Skinnidip, fresh fro-yo in hand, I saw the flashing lights outside and decided, against my better judgement, to head for the border...you know, in case any of the EMT guys looked like they stepped off Grey's Anatomy or something. (it's true.) \n\nBut before I could get there, I had to cross the drive-thru of death. \nAnd so did another man, however he was in an electric wheel chair...\n\n...dramatic pause...\n\nWhile we were crossing the crosswalk, a large unmarked van pulled out of the drive-thru and was blocking the pedestrian walkway in attempt to turn onto Burnside (which was essentially blocked by the now parade of ambulances and fire trucks). \n\nThis did NOT bode well for Electric Wheelchair Man. He decided to take matters into his own hand and steer his way onto Burnside in front of the van, where he proceeded to stop and vehemently cuss out the van driver.  \n\nHowever, with one wheel on the street and the other on the lip of the drive-thru, his wheel got jammed, his tires were spinning, and I was expecting to see dark smoke start spewing out of a number of orifices at  any moment.\n\nNeedless to say, about 3 steps behind Electric Wheelchair Man, I was in a rather awkward position. But come hell or high water, I was going to help this man! I dropped my yogurt (with a tear) and rushed to, well, I'm not sure what I was going to do because before I could do it, Electric Wheelchair Man GETS OFF his chair, picks it up, and carries it to the other side of the drive-thru!  He then demanded that the driver step out of his van and fight.

I guess from what i read they use a filler in some of their beef, but you can get chicken or steak as well. Nothing wrong with their meat IMO. the media blows things out of proportion just to make a joke.\n\nThe only thing i know is there isn't loud music playing in the background and long lines. I also never go to Tijuana Flats on a day other then Tuesday. I am not that big a Mexican food person to pay over five bucks. Lately TF has been skimpy on the meat anyway. it varies from week to week, but there is very little meat in the tacos.  They used to fill those suckers up but not no more.\n\nWhat I love about this Taco Bell is the employees are great, they also get the food out fast and keep the place immaculate.

Then a few months ago a cyclone fence appeared around it and ominous construction equipment appeared around the old building.  Soon a sign appeared, \"Coming Soon: Taco Bell\"  But wasn't it a Taco Bell before?\n\nToday I found time in my ultra busy high profile life to pay a visit to the newer, more colorful and much smaller Taco Bell.  I almost didn't.  Why?  Because I pulled into the parking lot and I couldn't readily identify where to park my car.  You have to pull in but wait watch the spaces on the left, they are car and van pool parking (?!?), to the right is for handicapped and maybe there is one space in there.  So I drove forward a bit and passed a skinny entrance into a parking area that forces you to walk across the drive-thru lane.  Or you can park past the drive thru entrance way up past the building.  Awesome planning!\n\nI hiked back to the building and found the front door.  Upon walking in my senses were dulled by earth tones and then assaulted with accents of bright yellow, very southwestern.  I ordered with the nice girl at the back of the place and took a moment to notice that even though the building is smaller there was probably more seating in this configuration than in the old one.  \n\nWhile I waited for my order of run for the border I walked up to the soda vending contraption.  Lots of buttons so my hopes were buoyed that there would be some new diet options.  16 options and if you count water and unsweetened iced tea there are three options for diet oriented drinks, and only one diet soda option.  When will they learn?\n\nIt's cheap, it is edible, it doesn't upset my stomach and I have never got food poisoning from them, that makes it a viable quick lunch option that is possibly a little healthier than a burger and fries.

So, first of all, all of the items were in the bag. That's step one, and this place got it right. Check.\n\nSecond of all, and most important of all, is the consistency in the flavor and the quality of the product. Most of it was A+ Taco Bell. The $1 premium burritos they are offering now are super good. They have some different flavorings going on that's different from the same ol' same ol'. I recommend trying them. \n\nBut the nachos we got were absolute garbage. There were more chip crumbs than there were chips. We definitely got the handfuls from the bottom of the chip bag. Also, we paid the 80-cent upcharge for the steak nachos, and we literally got three pieces of steak. I know a lot of people say that and they lie, because people like to blow things out of proportion, but I counted the pieces of steak. Three.

Upon reaching the store, we followed the instructions of the email to pick up in store and were directed (somewhat abrasively) to drive through the drive thru instead. When we made it to the window, I told the woman at the window the order was under my wife's name and she said she hadn't received it so I responded that it could also be under my own (which I told her). She said they didn't have the order and called the assistant manager over to help. Before he came over, I confirmed that we were at the right address, just in case. When he arrived, things went off the rails.\n\nJ, the assistant manager, came over and said they didn't have the order yet. I showed him the email from their site and it had an order id, which I gave to him. He said that they didn't have the order yet and I would have to wait until I did (mind you, he never turned around once in this conversation to check on anything). I pointed out that it showed as having been made in the tracker and was ready for pickup and he said this was the nature of tech (WHAT?! I grew up on the internet, this is not how it works) and they couldn't give me food without the order coming through. I asked if I should issue a chargeback through my credit card, what was my recourse here, and he said I should take it up with my credit card if needed, but giving me the food would be the same as giving out free food.\n\n(As reasonable as that might sound, that's what an assistant manager at a Taco Bell with a customer with proof of ordering and a relatively small order should probably jump to first, instead of opting to save the company a few dollars in materials which would be offset by the cost of a chargeback anyhow.)\n\nDuring this time, J is hanging out the window and ignoring the staff behind him. I hear them asking \"what name did they order under?\" and \"what did they order?\", which J just ignored. He didn't turn around to answer the question, he just kept looking forward and saying they couldn't do anything. Whichever intrepid employee took initiative to figure this out, good on you. It wasn't until one of them barged in and said \"we have their order\" when J finally backed off and was all of a sudden apologetic.\n\nDuring this whole process, J ignored his employees, didn't even bother to check if my order id was available and blocked our ability to talk to anybody who *could* help. There was no \"let's figure out how to make this work\" or even the slightest hint at J trying to reconcile the situation. he didn't try to figure out if our order number matched up or even try to get any clarifying information.
