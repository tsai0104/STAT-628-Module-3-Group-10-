 in my order was right but they gave me enough food to feed an African, I ordered for me and  my brother I got enough food to feed all of Angola very pumped,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food will be good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but as a fast food restaurant you expect your food In a timely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food has good,taste bu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only for them to hand me 3 big bags of food,they handed me the food ,I ordered one burrito ,ok not that big a deal but the burrito was not good,you know how sometimes they make the beans like flavorless,I worried the meat was bad,definitely the lettuce/tomatoes had gone bad although I still suspect the meat had to be causing the smell,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food served at the right,My wife's fresco taco had some str,ands of cheese in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I installed yelp and created an account and wrote this review about the time it took to get a taco,all while waiting for my taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As my food was completed,I ordered a few soft tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
barely warm food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food came out quick,the food was good,I did not give this establishment five stars because there was nothing in the food that st,three tacos , and cheap and came out good my only problem and the reason I gave this place the rating I did is because one of my tacos had a hair in it ,Once I found the hairs I went up to the very nice and helpful cashier and she happily replaced it and even gave me an extra hard taco for free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place makes no effort to put out decent food, The food is dry, MUCH better food there, They also screw up on the ingredients , and tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is what it is,the cost comparatively priced to other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With my first bite of my nachos bel grande their was a sticker in my food that I choked on,Dear Taco Bell please pay better attention to what goes in your food,and upon my last bite their was a huge hair covered in meat ,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I typically have a decent process of ordering food through this taco bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had tacos bean burrito ,and nachos and its plain garbage taste nothing like tacobell in california or illinois,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This tacobell always has really fast,All in all I love this tacobel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once I received my food,Go somewhere else like Tijuana flats (Tijuana flats had excellent service and food),Since I'm vegetarian I ordered a supreme crunch wrap with substitute beans ,and double checked to make sure she rang it up correctly and then after paying I looked at my receipt and didn't say substitute beans so I clarify with cashier again ,it had meat in it after I bit into it,I saw there was meat ,and spit it out but I triple check with cashier that to make sure there was no meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went through the drive thru with some friends around 11:45pm and it took too long to order and get our food for us being the only,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Taco Bell is my favorite food ,The food quality is also consistently the best I've ever seen,depending on the age and other factors the food quality can degrade,but every time I visit this Taco Bell the quality of the ingredients seems to be as if they are as fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Oh and my husband loves the cool ranch dorito tacos,and now the difference between a real taco ,and a bagged taco meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do not expect Taco Bell to be great food,chips are stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was good,although we were shorted a taco, The main reason that has me dissatisfied is how little nacho cheese I was given with an order of nachos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfriendly staff (and there's usually a kitchen full of 6+ making food),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was bachelor food ,Needless to say we thought we had food poisoning ,Maybe one of the workers thought it would be fun to make people trip out or maybe we ate some cleaning fluid from the counter top that got in to our food,I refuse to eat their food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love spicy food,which are basically small burritos, Mild is chipotle,I started with a bite of the chipotle as a baseline,prices are low,beans,a little meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amount of time and the food is always mediocre whether it be cold,Every time I come here the food is fresh,good food,at a good price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freshly made warm and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My review used to be 2 stars but then I received this today with some equally skimpy potato soft tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great customer service and food,Girl at the counter was very polite I think she had red hair and an Ashley made my food ,It was very busy and they were fast and delivered great food,and it was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Theirs location makes good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nor was the bean burrito,the soft chicken taco wasn't too bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got home and all my food was cold,Second time they shorted me 1 taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they probably pay their staff so little they have very poor quality food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is pretty,From the time I ordered to the time I got my food,Only thing I'd suggest is that they get the food out faster,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now I know what that tastes like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got home and all my food was cold,Second time they shorted me 1 taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only beans,Ended up with a pizza full of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You are better off going inside or somewhere else for food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I asked to speak to the manager and asked why the 20 to 25 cars that went through the drive through after I ordered got their food first,    As far as food quality it was sub, I agree with the kids that the OC taco bell food is much better, They took my order at 6:11 and 6:38pm I finally got my 4 tacos ,but I do take issue waiting almost 30 minutes for a few tacos while 20+ orders after mine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Generous portions of sour cream if you are looking for that,Food is Taco Bell quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For example tonight we ordered: 1 Steak XXL GSB no sour no guacamole,Many times they have added the sour cream and guacamole,Also ordered a Crunchwrap with no sour cream ,and well I took a big bite and bit into nothing but sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's typical Taco Bell food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is pretty good,But the food is always hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Since having someone pick through my food to remove the gross,we're out the food ,he began picking through my taco salad to remove the part that wasn't ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all Taco Bell food is the same,Three cars ahead of me and it took more than 25 minutes to get tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I only order the Mexican pizza so this review is less about food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Out of food ,  Never seen so many people waiting so long to get low quality food,  When it takes 15 mins to get a taco ,and taco shells, Low quality isn't their fault since it's Taco Bell ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today they were out of tortillas for the stuffed burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I give this place four stars because their food is always hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all the condiments and food accessories are always stocked ,The food is always hot,Food quality I think is also as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I'm a picking vegetarian with all beans no meat orders ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cold food every time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have noticed no portion or quality variance from other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is Taco Bell,Sometimes up to 20 minutes for your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
End up being in there longer than the entire line and the person who orders after me gets their food,Five people standing around and not one mentions wheres this persons food,I literally had three tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will still take them 25 minutes to give you a couple tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ask for soft tacos ,I order chicken ,and I get steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is Taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have a slight taco addiction these days so if it's meat in a shell with cheese,lettuce and sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20 minutes 5 employees before they would even start on our food then served the window before us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you want below average food,The food there is always better ,It's worth the extra 2 min drive to go to the Taco Bell on corner of Morse ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent food ,You have to take water from the refreshments machine and it tastes bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
two burritos with no onions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from the food to the friendliness ,Don't spend almost an hour waiting for your food - it isn't worth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They got everyone's order correct and the food tasted really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both quesadillas we ordered barely had any cheese inside,Then my 50 cent side of sour cream was half full,I could've just bought a tub of sour cream for 50 cents more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fast and the food is so fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it is not any type of food that Taco Bell serves,unless you like foreign objects in your food,I asked for and paid for extra sour cream on my nachos,I got NO sour cream at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I like the bean burritos without sauce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super friendly drive through staff and one of the best tasting burritos I've ever had from a Taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
order a number 7 chicken quesadilla ,and practically did not have chicken eat a slice without a piece of chicken inside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the Texas of Fast food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
went to the line and made our food ,AND remembered to give us our sauce when he handed the food out the window,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food i have gotten from them is usually lukewarm,For some strange reason it also always tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and then rolled into burrito form so exquisitely that it was if they were made by the h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Be ready to sit in the drive through for an HOUR for a taco post-Disney,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I ordered the steak quesadilla, The steak quesadilla satisfied my taste buds ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually order with beans instead of meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The guy dressing the tacos at 12:00pm THE BUSIEST time of the day was terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They don't mess up on orders and the food is hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Consistently wait a long time for uneven food,everyone in the store was involved because we were stuck in the 7th circle of Hell waiting for our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only reason they got 2 stars is because my food was hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have an allergy to dairy so I asked for my breakfast crunch wrap to be made without cheese,When I got home and took a bite of my crunch wrap I got a mouth full of cheese,It's just very upsetting that when you tell them you have an allergy that they don't respect it enough to spend a few extra minutes to just make one without cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Slowest taco Bell in the entire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While this TB offers the usual assortment of food that will kill you immediately interspersed with food that will kill you more slowly,they're more suggestive of My Little Pony than they are of fast food tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And today I waited for over 15 minutes for my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it did seem to take a LONG time to get my food compared to other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was charged for food items by an employee (Rebecca) who neglected to put the items in my bag,  She said she was throwing my food out that was made, The fact that she didn't give me my food the first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chalupa evokes the experience of authentic Mexican food much the way Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean simulates the real,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you may wait longer for your food than if you waited in the drive through,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fairly consistent service and tasty food,Came with 4 different crunchy tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not once but twice my food was prepared wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Five stars for their great fast service and quality food,We ate there consistently for 10 Nights and no change in quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And it can take longer than 10 minutes to get food here,half stuffed burritos ,ALWAYS out of the chicken rolled tacos,and yellow lettuce with a almost frozen cheese are a normal,Always a disappointment when it comes to the quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was short a crunchy taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A super fun activity is to get your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My review used to be 2 stars but then I received this today with some equally skimpy potato soft tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20 full minutes later we'd received no food while folks who ordered after us were finally getting their food ,and when I asked when we could expect our food to be ready,Upon refunding our money (after waiting 25 mins at that point) the shift manager then grabbed a bag of food ,but the other folks who were waiting patiently for their food,6 of which were plain ol' tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food here is as dece,hot mess after the club food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 stars for the food,I asked to have my chicken quesadilla double toasted ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1 crunchy taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These guys bust their arses everyday workin shite wage for makin shite burritos give em a break man for fuckers sake eat a frekkin,taco supreme ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or at least get our food in a reasonable,I ordered my food, As I was waiting for my food there was a traffic jam outside where people were trying to reverse out of the drive thru line,I ordered my food per my receipt at 5pm ,There were over 20 receipts on the counter top by the register all spread out where people had got their food ,I have vowed to drive the 4 miles up the street to the other taco bell and get my food there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited for the two cars in front of me to get their food which took 15 mins,when I got to the window I paid for my food ,"""you can't place food orders at the window",I ordered a $5 taco box that includes TWO tacos ,can you imagine at a taco joint,And then I had to wait another 10 mins for my two tacos ,now I'm even more hungry and I asked to add another taco,and asked for some sour cream, sour cream is fifty,,,,,,,,,,,
I got 2 soft tacos ,The problem came when I ordered a taco salad without sour,but I said no sour cream ,Granted it was a much larger salad than the last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Over 45 minutes for a 12 pk of tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have to seriously question if the food temperatures met Health Department regulations, If it isn't even warm enough to melt the cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I mean the food is just what you'd expect,Reviewing Taco Bell for the food is sort of besides the point,Did the food get out fast,But the food took nine ,Given that it was dinner hour and that some folks were ordering mountains of food,"But it's also not ""fast"" food",and a half minutes for a bean burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From entering the line to exiting with my food it was 47 minutes,There is NO world in which it should take over 40 minutes to get a couple of tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food has always been decent,and I have never had any problems with food temperature,So I will continue to patronize this TB location when I have a semi-Mexican food craving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food quality is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which was fine because i didn't mind coming inside to get my food to go,Sometimes i get my food ,and it's super fresh and delicious within a few minutes but most of the time you wait 30 minutes or longer in the drive thru for $5 worth of food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not sure if you all aren't changing oils or handling food properly,Each item tasted worse then the next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30 minutes we waited for food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this taco really cranks my tractor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10 minutes after that I got my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they've also given me above par food on most other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
number 7 steak with a soft taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It smells like food inside,I came here after my latest surgery and ordered some burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can go and sit down and order a steak almost anywhere else ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
) It'll be worth it to get better quality food in a more efficient,I frequently order the shredded chicken burrito (along with many,other things) and the burritos I receive have half the filling I get from other,2 times in the last month I've received burritos with just shredded chicken in them,rice,The SCB is also supposed to include chicken,cheese,and a teeny TINY bit of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,
 40 mins later I was just getting my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seven people got there food before me,The loaded manager got a bunch of free food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The last three times I ate here I couldnt finish all my food it tasted so bad,The service is lightning fast but maybe they should start taking a little more time in preparing the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Two big boxes and s 10 pack of tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just on a whim after a meeting in downtown I stopped at this and Taco Bell right off the freeway was in the mood for a Crunchwrap so I got the Crunchwrap and a taco ,and while I was eating the taco I noticed the show tasted just a little,bit out of date a little bit stale and I got that strange does Taco Bell is always so busy so when I bit into the Crunchwrap I was even more shocked to taste and extremely rancid stale tortilla shell but since I went through the drive-thru and went back on the freeway I couldn't turn around go back and exchange it and what would they exchange it was from the same pile of the taco shells I was very disappointed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is always hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you expect the food to be average,It's taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Horrible food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I drove to the window and she was being being rude and said call 1800- taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My review used to be 2 stars but then I received this today with some equally skimpy potato soft tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a bean burrito for myself ,How do you mess up a bean burrito,and as I took a bite it tasted rotten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its a taco bell so it doesnt matter about the food,is how it takes no less then 15 minutes to get your food,This is slow food,Wasting my time for a damn cheap taco food,I have been in there to order a single taco,literally one standard taco,although the quality is,It always tastes the same,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I finally got my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff is usually pretty nice and they usually get the food right at least,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 there has never been a time where they actually got my order correct and gave me all the food I ordered,and they do not listen to your order or double check the food in the bag is all there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didn't even eat my food I was so disguste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
00 ever spent now to the food,Last but not least The 6 pc Naked Chicken was nice and warm with a side of cheese sauce on that thang they were good,The Burrito was massive soft filled with Beef yummy and the lettuce was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got the food 45 minutes later,Ordered 3 crunchy tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mind you we got charged meal price ,Apparently all taco bells do not have anything but beef chicken ,and cheese in the Orl,and they didn't give us a few meal due to the lack of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The employees appear to actually like their job and it shows in the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm actually impressed with the quality of the food it looked just like the commercial,Food came out super quick and was the best quality I've ever seen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Their ""burrito supreme",""" is not a supreme burrito",It's about the size of one of their dollar menu burritos,Del Taco has EPIC burritos,A Chipotle burrito platter is also MUCH larger than this,which are MMMUCH BIGGER and BETTER for the same price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After another 10 minutes they finally got off their behinds to give me my single breakfast burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the quality of the food is lacking ,The food is always consistent,the quality is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Try the vegetarian power bowl,( Also comes with chicken or steak if you like) Saborito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
makes the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We drove through at around 1030 am and the staff was quick accurate and the food hot,We asked for extra cheese on the nachos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is consistent,So what if you asked for cheese instead of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 You don't even see any beans on one of them, I prefer quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today I went and ordered a taco salad ,I got a total of 3 jalapenos on the nachos and 4 on the salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The boys ordered their usual Beefy 5 layered burrito,I ordered a Steak power bowl sans the rice ,and beans,guacamole,lettuce and cheese,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Soft shell stuffed with cheese and overflowing with meat,lettuce and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Ordered 3 tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food,They gave food to 2 other,The taco shell was old,The taco was dry,quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Order stuff without meat ,but some of the order came with meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by the time you get your food you don't even want it anymor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 accurate orders and for the most part have fresh food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I ordered $25 worth of food , Then I come back and the manager tells me I didn't order that much food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wrote review after eating the food at my nearby,hotel and again I could not find any fault with food presentation/quality,in fact probably that best tostada I've ever seen / tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I could not fit my work truck through the drive-through and Lead carry-out attendant would not open the door to let me pay for the food kept telling me to walk around the entire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wasn't going to write a review had they answered the phone but being that they are to busy giving people the wrong food so they can't answer I decided to rant my frustrations here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was charged more than the price listed on the drive-thru,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wow I think it's amazing how you going to a place they miss your order up pretty bad get shitty ass service and everything like that then you called and complained and they send you a coupon for 3 dollars really after you spend 10 on tacos they're going to give you 3 dollar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took over 45 minutes for food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Waited over 40 minutes for food as workers moved at a glacial,I almost celebrated a birthday waiting for some stankass food that tasted like dog excrement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you like Taco Bell food,and almost always mess up food prep,they'll give you messed up tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you sell the beef and I want beef instead of chicken why won't you just not put chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some friends and I ordered some food on the wall kiosks in this Taco Bell ,and began to wait for our food,However it soon became apparent that 20 minutes had passed since we ordered our food,People who arrived after us were receiving their food ,At this point it took them another ten minutes to even begin the food that was ordered over a half,What truly left a bitter taste in my mouth was the employees reaction to our situation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Dylan and Josh made me fresh rice chalupas ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's alwaaaaays packed even at 2am still packed and when it's packed it means your food is made sloppy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great to have 22 sauces with no food to put it on,Dear tacobell,Also What kind of tacobell is out of tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food takes forever to come out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was ordering a bowl,When I got to window I was told there was no lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they might spit in your food,"""ok dont spit in my food or anything like that ok"" ",I ordered a simple $10 value meal and they were out of the fritos but had the meat,so I just politely asked could they then substitute sour cream for the fritos instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Employees not listening to the manager to make my food ,30 minutes to make two  bean burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5 layer burrito has 2 layers of tortilla,No beans,a layer of cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So he came home grabbed the food ,and drove back for the THIRD time and went to return the food,A bug in the food is gross,accident or not and I am not eating food with a bug in it,the food ,We wasted money on disgusting food that we didn't eat,It's not like we were trying to make a buck and get free food,We were returning the food ,food quality ,It's just obvious they don't care about quality st,,,,,,,,,,
 I should've walked to Pollo Tropical instead of wasting 20-25 minutes to get a simple burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went through the drive through and the food was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The love affair started back in college when all I could afford was the bean burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They can't even make a small chicken quesad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the #2 and three soft tacos from the drive thru just to get five mins down the road ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My food was prepared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We had to wait an extra twenty minutes to get our food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
received their food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I'm so tired of ordering something and getting an ¢85 bean burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No beef on the taco supreme ,I'm allergic to certain things so I ask for no beans on my nachos ,and beef on the nachos along with beans,and no meat on it as well due,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15 minutes later only 3 cars had gotten food,How hard is it to fry some food,Be prepared to spend more time waiting for food than you do in a real,make a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location rocks and is the best place to get free food,but I keep coming back for the free food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would give it one star but the food we did receive was not bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really upsetting seeing as we waited sooooo long to get this food before the long,When we finally got our tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waiting on 3 tacos took over 10 minutes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of the food was fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last night I wasted 20+ minutes of my time waiting in line and over $20 on no meat but beans in my tacos because the man taking my order did not underst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  The food was the same,as every other Taco Bell but the service is so slow you could go to a full service restaurant and get your food faster,  Total time from getting in line and driving away with my food 30 minutes ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My steak quesadilla came with absolutely no steak in it also asked for extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They handed my food to me before I even sat down,The food was super,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and if I have to tell you about the food,So this post isn't about the food,because it's the same taste and fast food quality that you can get at any Taco Bell location across this great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We had to wait 15 minutes to get 10 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both food items I ordered came with the items I asked for to be left off ,I work in the food industry too ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we got home and my vegan wrap was full of cheese so I just could not eat any of the taco bell food,he has food poisoning ,and is very very sick from this food,a chunch wrap beans instead of meat and no sour cream and a taco beans instead of meat,I am vegan so I ordered a crunchwrap supreme and subbed beans for the meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't worry about it I'll make your food""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The shredded chicken tacos were awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I had only low expectations when I agreed to take my family on the way home from delivering food to the gr,most importantly a beef to chicken substitution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Our food came out very fast ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I put it as 4 stars because they got rid of my favorite burrito (gri,lled cheese burrito),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm glad I can help pay for the new remodel by purchasing meatless tacos,loads of lettuce and cheese with NO meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they need to hire more competent and motivated people who can provide quality of customer servic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do not go to Taco Bell for quality food,received my food pretty quickly,I was at the light and opened my box to check my food,I killed the bug and took it back along with the food ,I've had food from a few,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the second time I've been here & had to wait FOREVER for food in the drive thru,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I pulled up in the drive thru and I've literally been sitting here for 30 minutes all to get to the window and he tells me they don't have anything to eat except crunchy tacos,I don't even eat meat I was just gonna get cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The dining area is usually dirty with food crumbs on all the tables ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
once I've waited 30 before just leaving without food,There's a KFC in both directions along the highway and a taco Bell 10 mins away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It really sucks that it's good food in a pinch,I picked up the food on the way out of town the closing manager literally laughed at me on the phone,A shredded chicken burrito with extra,I'm pretty sure they moved the quesarito recipe with a shredded chicken burrito recipe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took 30 minutes for 3 plain tacos,They were maybe understaffed but watching them take about a minute to wrap the damn taco was making me mad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Paid extra to substitute beef with chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheesey bean and rice burrito for 1$ can't be beat ( al,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the bowl is almost the same price as Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes staff forgets edited items from menu and give you default order from menu so you paid extra for chicken Crunchwrap ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
although everytime we order tacos we rarely get any cheese,The tacos would be alot better with more chees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you love their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also want to add I waited 15 min for two burritos and this lady who was there before me was there waiting so long her and her daughter both asked a few times about their meal and got told to wait and they ended up just leaving without food or a refun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I once waited 10 minutes for a single taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a taco bell so you don't expect the quality of food to be great,some food item,It usually doesn't matter much to me because all the food at taco bell is the same, quality to me (i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I headed home and ate my food,The food was fire ,I feared that it wouldn't be warm but it was toasty and delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They filled the entire bag half way with just sauce packets and left out half our food order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh and the tacos were beyond sloppy,I ordered a chicken chalupa with nacho,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gave me my food took my credit card h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the staff flirted with me and the food was POORLY made,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food always tastes like it was just made,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went there around 11:00 and received my food only a few,The burritos were delicious, and the tacos were alright,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We went through the drive-through after leaving universal and barely waited for our food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but like damn how hard is it to make a supreme taco actually supreme,not a horrible establishment but it's irritating going 4 different times and paying for supreme tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It is a slow food Establishment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are at least 8 high school kids that haven't gotten food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30 minutes for crappie tacos aka Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am a tacobell fiend,I went to four other tacobell locations in the area trying to find good,tacobell,primarily adding meat to vegetarian,I usually place a mobile order for drive thru pickup and asked a few times in the past if they would seperate the vegetarian items & meat items (for the other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still took forever to give me my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took over 45 minutes for food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know it's not authentic Mexican but some food is good,food served hot,The menu looks big but most are usually the same food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sure as hell isn't making food ,It's tacos and burritos,cheese and beans in it ,throw some meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually get the chalupa and the bean burrito then i come on myself because that's what chalupas do to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was pretty much,Drove through as required with the pandemic and ordered a chicken power bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For one it takes forever in the drive thru &2 they gave me the wrong food  I asked for burritos not tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I simply asked for ""no cheese and sour cream"" on my wife's tacos since she's lactose",We received dry tacos with nothing ,but cheese/chicken inside (picture attached),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unfolded my burritos to each of them dry as hell no sauce,cmoooon I just wanted a cheap tacobell meal ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because they frequently make small mistakes on tacos,Gonna go to the Stoughton location the next time I crave tacos,but my wife is very particular and won't even eat something if there is lettuce on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We got home and there was only 9 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kindly if 9 response to me was that they make burritos the way they make them and if I don't like it I can stop coming back to this Taco Bell or I can take my food away it's already made,I come through the Taco Bell a lot and every time I ask for sour cream there's always just a tiny bit in the very bottom of my burrito I asked the manager,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was Taco Bell food so,But the service was way above Taco Bell quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My kid got his liquid cheese injection ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have two dedicated food lines for making the food,Had crappy food at the drive-thru,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 After ordering our food, It was so overwhelming that we decided to leave and take our food to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am a vegan and requested extra potato's in my cheesy bean and rice burrito ,and for the spicy potato soft taco they added cheese ,when the request was for no cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Terrible taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Upon getting to the window I placed an order for two chicken quesadillas with a young,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which mind you is a nice mini burrito loaded with taters ,at a very convenient price,and cheese,tasting as if they were fresh out the freezer :/  Then they gypped me on the nacho cheese sauce for my nacho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I absolutely love the staff and the food,Great service with fresh food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make it poor quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I have given them many chances but the food keeps tasting not fresh,They used to make fresh tacos,but lately my tacos are hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I opened the last burrito to eat ,Either someone was eating and working and wrapped the wrong burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was gross,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Overall the food was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food there is really goo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and they gave me chips instead of cinnamon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight was the last straw when they gave me a crunchy taco ,which is nearly 3x the price of the item I received,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always come here after a bar round and the food is really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plus the food was super,something about him made my 1am burrito less pitiful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They forgot one of our $1 potato tacos tonight ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once the food is ordered it takes several,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UPDATE 5/13: There was only one car ahead of me in the drive thru but it took me twenty five minutes to get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just give me my burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How the HELL do you run out of taco meat ,and beans at a taco bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is definitely better than the environment in which it is consumed,Is the food really that good,I usually walk in to grab a quick bean burrito or a spicy chicken burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This taco bell has very nice decoration inside and recently i was so happy that this place and the owner try very hard to keep customers happy and have fresh   food at the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They always take forever to greet me at the window and bring me my food late at ni,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was lettuce and tomato in my cheese quesadilla--- yuk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shitty tacos late at night,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then when I got I food I asked for hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food doesn't seem to st,doesn't mean you'll get the same quality at each location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will say they have made my food correctly every time ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now let's about the customer service/sales associate: no need for one since I used the Taco Bell app to purchase my food,He kindly gave me the food in the bag ,a drink and the burrito for about $7 (which is average,They had this new taco called the Bacon Chicken Chalupa , amount) but it was delicious,and it tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even still the food is really poorly made, First time food was terrible,but there is almost nothing in my burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wrong prices charged,Even rice once,like chicken or ground beef,running out of key ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finally I'm 2nd to the window about to pay and get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great price,Great option for vegetarians since you can substitute beans for meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Make sure you check your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my food fell apart,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as I observed with all the horseplay and lack of interest to get the customers In and out it should never take 15mins for a 2tacos (2nd strike) ,(3rd strike) as I'm in route to my hotel I take a bite of my Hard taco which has clearly been out  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Price is very reasonable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm only giving this 3 stars instead of 1 because after waiting nearly an eternity for food one night,the food has been your average,Not sure why everyone in the food industry here hates their lives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who can say no to nacho cheese sauce though,But the quality is better ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but this location has been very consistent with their service and food preparation with the orders that I have had,I don't think I have ever waited more than 5 minutes to get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I guess this is what is to be expected from taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is almost not edible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My one big tip: request to get your burritos grilled,Don't eat meat so TC has the best options for me,They had issues with their supply of essentials incl cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This place will make you want to ""return to sender"" your food items ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality ,and taste always remains consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm only giving this 3 stars instead of 1 because after waiting nearly an eternity for food one night,the food has been your average,Not sure why everyone in the food industry here hates their lives,my gf pulled out our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time we get home we realize that either were missing food or the food given wasn't the correct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Drive through lady literally always throws the bag of food at me,Third times a charm after their third attempt all the correct food is in the bag,*update there was spit on the two tacos that I asked them to make me that they forgot the first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the dining/waiting area feels like it was partway dismantled in a hurry a while ago in anticipation of renovations that never happened with mounting holes on a disused food tray holder ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went with my girlfriend and she ordered a quesadilla while I ordered a combo deal for taco day ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wait over 20 minutes when a thug comes out with my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and food was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then sat at our table for awhile before the food was ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we skipped the freeze and ordered a Crunchwrap supreme and chicken quesadilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delicious food ,if a Taco Bell is clean and makes a decent taco,Now grab your to-go bag of standard issue tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Found pubic hair inside my double decker taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OK tacos at good, prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My review isn't on the food because it's Taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service was quick and fast and barley had to wait to get my food,The food was good,and fresh and delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Found a LONG BLACK HAIR in my food,gives better customer service and quality than this place does,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
came with good amount of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the grilled stuffed burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was good,but the filth around us detracted us from the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ever since the new manager Dustin took over service and food quality has greatly improved,the food taste fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or serve you lukewarm food,This taco was fresh,and bursting with meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I normally don't write about chains since I'm sure everyone knows the quality of the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Did you know they have salsa verde,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typically the food always comes out tasting fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love tacobell anyways,This tacobell is a gem,"They are the first tacobell to pretty up my ""tacos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Clearly asked for no beans on the burrito supreme,And when we got home I made it through 1/3 of the burrito supreme ,Spit it out and threw out the burrito,and then bit into a mouthful of beans,Driving down the road we looked in the bag and saw no chips for the nachos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It smells so bad that when they open the drive-thru window to give us our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came there tonight in order to get some food after getting off work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
spend half the amount and get at least a passable facsimile of actual food fit for human,I feel as if the taco meat at Taco Bell has suddenly become watery,making it impossible to make it through your three taco meal before the third,Also why oh why are the taco shells stale the majority of the time now,Can you not figure out a way to keep the shells crispy and the meat non-,Is it just me or have a lot of the fast food that used to taste great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ordered 3 nacho cheeses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food for the occasional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the employees care so little about a customer who can see them imagine what they do to the food , I would be very afraid to eat the food from this Taco Bell given the attitude of their staff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything was fresh and the new grilled chicken quesadilla is pretty delicious,They are not stingy with the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the lobby/tables are more spacious but the quality of food remains the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUSHED by 4 other burritos stacked on top of them,1 - We ordered the #3 crunchy SUPREME taco combo ,2 - Then the tacos were at the bottom of the bag,3 - The tacos were crushed,I had to eat them in a bowl,and it didn't have any sour cream or the tomatoes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Drive thru backed around the building and the workers are dancing and jacking around while Making the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered 9 tacos,Then they gave me six tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was usual, Taco Bell flavor and quality- nothing noteworthy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Giving me the wrong type of meat in a burrito,not knowing what a grilled stuft burrito is that is on their own,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I come for quesalupa which is Great with chicken with queso in the shell it's worth but it does take time for food to come out,they should hire more people if they need more man power to get the food out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's not even worth talking or going back to that establishment for more food or for them to fix their mistakes,a burrito that wasn't supposed to have onions had a onions loaded in it ,and my husbands burrito was falling apart in half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have old tasting food ,and I got little to no beef in my taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is nice, and hot when I order and the service quality is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ingredients they made the wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but still shy of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was okay,taco little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of my tacos had a minuscule, amount of meat on it (see picture),I got home and they hadn't closed the lid on the cheese sauce from the nachos,I got 2 cheesy gordita crunches and nachos and cheese,The cheese didn't spill this time,I barely tasted it as I ate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As for the food,which I think says a lot for a fast-food joint,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't order the taco salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're always fucking something up and if they aren't it's poor quality food,all my food is going back ,I had my servant pick me up two beefy furito burritos with sour,If they didn't fuck up and actually gave me sour cream it'd be one little squirt on one end of the burrito,my mom ordered a 7 layer burrito ,Once he arrived home I began to eat them and I realized there was no sour cream,I paid 90 extra cents for the sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10 min later the guy orders something else while still waiting on his food,I ask myself every time I go there if they are butchering the cow in the back to get the beef for the tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Normally the food all tastes the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We also noticed that some of their food costs more than at other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the Doritos locos meal and got all regular hard tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How difficult is it to punch in 3 bean burritos,1 black bean burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all of our food was falling out all over the place,our tacos were poorly wrapped,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,I ordered 2 doritto tacos,he ended up charging me for 3 tacos ,I had to turn around without getting hit before pulling around the corner to finally find the drive through window,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" I left confused and when my friend and I got home we opened our bags and the tacos ",I can recall ordering a $5 box with a Spicy Triple Double Crunch Wrap w/ guacamole (which by the way implies 6 layers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I felt like I was eating garbage- and I actually did go through a dumpster diving ""freegan"" phase where I scavenged food from dumpsters behind grocery stores ",Because he's really into food that has been advertised to him on TV commercials,I felt better about doing that than I do about the bodily sensations which followed me consuming the goey blobs of excess cheese sauce dumped into tortillas that they try to pass off as burritos here,To get my boyfriend that new taco which has chicken as a shell,It was sour cream on top of too much low quality cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's also the time I got food poisoning ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cold food ,eat your food vomit the rest of the night,order steak get chicken,pay for an extra side of sour cream or cheese to find out the container is almost empty,wilting lettuce,hot salads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always crave tacos and Mexican food,Had it last week and actually woke up with food poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
including the girl who brought my food to the front for me,The food still is regular,TB food,It's good when you are in need of quick food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go to Taco Bell for their food, It also came with a burrito supreme,taco, It had a funky taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had the Cantina bowl ,For the most part I have disliked Taco bell because living in NY the quality was always poor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its alright for fake mexican food,Its good for late night last minute food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Longest line and VERY bad quality food even for fast food,Gave them two chances because of location and soft tacos were soggy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was the average,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are continuing to put out great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Beware of price hikes,due to the fact that the franchisee has higher prices than any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the smothered burrito, This smothered burrito is accepted,Im so happy to finally see a burrito that is served with red,  You can get this same burrito at ANY taco bell now, Still though I will go back for this burrito,sauce and melted cheese on top ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service was good and the food was hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just the food,Go to the one on north Druid hills if you want good and accurate food from Taco Bell,Tonight I was craving a bean burrito,I needed more than just a bean burrito,I get to my burrito ,I open up the burrito ,If I order and pay for a taco supreme,half the time I get a regular taco,so I ordered some cool ranch tacos,I eat the tacos,but am left with almost no beans ,the beans aren't even lukewarm,which are both in broken shells with a gallon of sour cream,It was like eating sour cream in a shell,,,,,,
As Brits we are used to burgers for fast food but the crispy tacos are amazing,Low prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15 mins to get food @ 2 pm on a Tuesday, You have employees w/ serious attitudes that are trading food over the counter for c,He got his food in about 3 minutes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You're better off getting your tacos from Wendy's across the street,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pull up in front of the drive thru and wait cuz your bean burrito needs another 12 minutes to cook,here's a taco,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and what did i get on my 3 fresco bean burritos,no cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food really isn't all that either I guess that's why I really don't eat Mexican,food that much, Now I know that I'm a little old but not that old but the prices are very high, But why are there prices more than the one on Washington here in Titusville I feel that it would be better for me to drive to the one on Washington than go to this one on Columbia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delicious tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Drove right up and picked up food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always stale,dry beans in the burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
since I had to order chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
since you already waited so long for your food,Also I don't think this Taco Bell knows what supreme tacos are,The multiple times I have ordered Locos Tacos supreme I have never once received that delicious sour cream on my taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I used to work in food service for 10 plus years so I'm very underst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality is disgusting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also asked for a grilled stuft burrito (among other,The kfc side NEVER has chicken ready,This particular instance I ordered a chicken nugget go-cup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She takes the orders and dispatches the food to both,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was your usual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for 6 soft tacos with no lettuce ,What I got was 6 soft tacos,all with lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have never had any problems with my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food was very dry and tasteless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If it's not the quality of food,It's unfortunate because I love burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is as to be expected,I would probably give them five stars except that every time I have ordered their cinnamon twists they just taste old, They just don't taste good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It's not health food,beans, Various combinations of meat, I had a steak quesarito,This was tender steak in cheesy sauce,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I've been to some places where when you open up your taco or burrito,I got a few tacos and a couple of burritos,but the burritos were nicely wrapped (,The tacos were crisp,or leaking oily meat,had plenty of cheese on them ,and the lettuce was still chilled,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nothing makes me question sanitary conditions like trash and food strewn about,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Missing items ordered and horrible assembly of the food ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not to mention having to wait another 10-15 mins for them to bring me my food, Then i finally get my food ,and all it is is lettuce and tomatoes literally no meat at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Skip the fast (not) food ,and visit Chuy's or On the Border down the way for better quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no lettuce or tomato on my tacos,guess what I found on tacos ,charged me the wrong price ,.lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had soft tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a bean and cheese burrito without onions ,I ordered tacos with tomatoes ,and got onions and no cheese barely any beans,To top it off when I poured out the chips for my nachos all I got was pieces,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's normally a quiet place to eat and enjoy your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Go to Chipotle across the road and you'll get your food faster ,Wow I just waited what seemed like an eternity for a couple tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It taste ok but my cholupa taste weird and it took a long time to get food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The company you work for ADVERTISES ""Fourth-Meal"" aka drunk food",they were running out of everything and people were waiting over an hour for food,You'll be sober before you get a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went in tonight and bought a bunch of food for a bunch of family members over at my house,I ordered my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I could have had better -food at the 7-11,My burrito was dry, If she was not back in 5  minutes I would have to end my taco quest , I asked for no tomatoes on my taco,taco craving, My taco bell grande was ok but the refried beans were like, Instead I got no lettuce , As I wait I start thinking of my options which were plenty along in Kissimmee but I had my taste buds set for taco bell,,,,,,,,,,,,
Took over half an hour to get food ,and then there was a single taco missing from the order,Went in to ask for the missing taco ,"nasty about the ""missing"" taco as through we would make up a single",missing taco,Felt like they were insinuating we were lying and trying to make a dollar on a free taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1x had no beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was given a refund but legit wasted 20 minutes and wasn't able to get food,No food for me,Paid and was told they're out of beans, how does taco bell run out of their top ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was on par with other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went here just to satisfy my desire of the XXL steak nacho,It was almost $7 to load up on this platter of steak - well,it wasn't really steak - not sure,what it was but I know steak ,and this wasn't steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I haven't had the breakfast from here yet and even though we only come here once a year I know it's a place I can always count on that will actually have decent food for a decent, price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SUPER SHow long does it take to make a few tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food was okay but they screwed up part of our order instead of giving us ranch for the taco salad they gave salsa dressing,when we got back to our hotel that was kind of far away we discovered that it was salsa dressing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If they think it's funny to serve food they've bitten off of,think of what else they might be doing to your food because it's 'funny,They served me a burrito that someone had clearly taken a bit out of before h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I order the steak power burrito all the time ,and the girl at the window told me tonight that you can't order the power burrito after 11,No where does it say that AND I have ordered the power burrito after 11 before,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can always count on quick service and well prepared food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How long does it take to make a few tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got home and our food was gross,stale as shit and tasted like it sat all day long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Employees were playing around in the back while at least 7 people waited for food,Took me 30 minutes to get a bean burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
came home got two regular soft tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered $16 worth of food,Received $7 worth of food,"She said there is no way to take my number down or get my
food that I ordered unless I drive back with a documented",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then watched them had my food to the person who ordered after me,oh sorry about that we gave your food to someone else,Then I had to wait again for my food to be made,I waited 25 mintues for 2 chicken quesadillas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our order was messed up (hubby and I are vegans) and our order consisted of cheese instead of the fresco that we have always asked for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Being serious tho this place is straight trash and i think there meat is literal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quality of food is really good,but please explain why I bother using the app to skip the line is they don't make the food before I get there,Also make my vegetarian Crunchwrap wrong with BEEF added to it and my potatoes soft taco with cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was given two wrong burritos with my order & was not given a receipt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheese sauce was half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Therefore the only way for me to get food from this ""Open until 3am"" restaurant was to drive my non-existent",vehicle through their drive-thru in order to get food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My main issue was how impatient they were while we were in the drive thru ordering our food,they pushed and shoved the receipt and bag of food at us after touching the top of the bag,the burritos were good,The tacos were how they're supposed to be at every location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst service worst food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was very good,The general manager JR made sure we had everything we need and even brought our son a new taco without lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ran out if food (Mexican pizza) this should always be restocked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were not stingy with taco toppings ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today I get my taco looks like it was thrown into the bag ,and all the cheese is outside the taco ,and the meat is on one side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gave me the wrong food for a mobile,I got a few things but they gave me a bean burrito instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expecting Michelin restaurant quality service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband said his chalupa had a weird taste to it ,The cherry Pepsi tasted nasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nachos have cheese,When you're pregnant and craving nacho cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If I stick with bean and cheese burritos I might have a fighting chance to have a steady,I don't though and triple steak chalupa Gordita nacho box looks so good,Nacho cheese for fries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both items tasted as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered combos and gave us only the food ,Another time we went we ordered food on the app for pick up ,and when we got home we realized we were missing food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So as I'm paying for my food I ask "" can I have hot",Not to mention that whenever I go to Taco Bell they ask you if you want sauce before they even give you your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perfect and fresh tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh Taco Bell -- I know it isn't the healthiest of foods ,I am a bit upset that they don't do happier hour with food anymore -- a crunch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the manager came to us asking if our food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Actually shocking how fresh and packed the tacos are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I go to this Taco Bell and order a bean burrito fresco style it ALWAYS has cheese on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is only one ""double decker"" taco listed ",""" Yet when I ordered the ""double decker taco"" I got something less expensive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I once had to go back twice because they put beef in my Crunchwrap that I specified should be meat-free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get my food,The dude that waited on me tried to snatch the tray he put my food on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it just saddens me when I see people serve food with no care like that,the taco salad shell was served completely broken,I ordered some tacos on the side which were okay,Either the chicken is amazing,in terms of overall quality control ,The quality was not there at all,so you get all that old charcoal taste on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And if you order a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Go get some real food wish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From incorrect orders to burnt food ,and today waiting over 15 minutes in the dining room and still no food being prepared,Workers are fighting with each other in the back and customers are sitting there waiting for food for a longer time period than would be acceptable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food has sucked every time ,Wish I had a bowl of cereal instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Serving a broken  taco,Sorry that your life is  miserable  but that doesn't grant you freedom to ruin my taco Asshole,just a simple quality product,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my quesadillas are always a mess the cheese isnt even melted ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I was really taken by surprise today by how great the food looked ,and tasted ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're guaranteed a 15 minute wait for your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered some Mexican pizzas and they came undercooked and as a result got food poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Giving this place a 1 star simply because while I was waiting for my food the ""female","That makes me REALLY want to eat my food while I hear you talking about your ""privates"" Smfh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Consistently well prepared food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
took 20 minutes to get two soft tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The guy in the back is grabbing chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited in line for 30 mins to get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered some food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm giving it a 1 star just because the food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe 3 orders ahead and 15 minutes later no food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is a pretty,but I do sometimes get a craving for their crunchy taco, It's a basic but solid fast food taco with seasoned,and cheese in a crunchy shell,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and here's your steak burrito,I noticed that there were only 2 total burritos in the bag, I watch in PURE HORROR as she (with bare hands) took one of the burritos out of the bag,"""  She then waved the other burrito in my face ","""  It took a great deal of effort and patience on my part to remind her that I had ordered 2 chicken burritos ", Eventually someone else brought out the new burrito ,and promptly threw out the first chicken burrito (the one that Susie Skipsalot opened with her bare h,"The steak burrito tasted ""off""",The chicken burrito, About halfway through the burrito, INSIDE my burrito was one of those plastic-wrapped,"with bare hands) and said ""Here's the chicken one", There were 8 (eight) nacho chips in there, One of the chips broke ,"and said ""And here's the steak one",and 1 steak,1 side of nachos with cheese,The order of nachos with cheese i ordered, The cheese sauce with them was cold,when I tried to dip it in the cheese
3 tacos,Go to eat the third taco no meat lmao like literally no meat I had a lettuce taco incredible,The chicken griller had rice in it strike 3, supéreme and a chicken griller,I get home no sour cream strike one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the staff don't seem to know what they're doing and take 30 minutes to fill the most basic of orders (a cheese quesadilla),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are pretty quick in taking my order and getting my food out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both food quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our food all came out within seconds of each other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bizarre since there was no one waiting for food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm almost always very patient with these kinds of mistakes because it's fast food but their lack of any sort of quality is the most consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered food through the drive thru today ,The best part is he threw them in the trash then picked them out of the trash with the same gloves he was touching customers food with he was ripping the chicken,I ordered the chicken tenders ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not really a Taco Bell fan so this review isn't about the food,I spoke to a manager that literally shrugged and repeated the incorrect price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I ordered my food,The food was fresh,I love Taco Bell and not having to cook my own food sometimes,not Ruth  Chris steak house or Antonio's,Is it 5 star quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Than while waiting for my food you see every employee walk by the windows many,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep in mind it's in a very touristy area so be prepared to wait your best bet is to use the mobile app and order your food it's awesom,Food was fresh and delicious my first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We went here this past Monday (7/13) while at the hospital very late and service was a bit slow (they seemed understaffed) but the food was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stopped here tonight for dinner and tried to get two beefy frito burritos ,but they were out so I got two beefy nacho burritos ,and a cheese quesadilla with no sauce and had to wait 5 mins for some guy to come out dressed in shorts and a tank top and got a cheese quesadilla with sauce and two gross smushed burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No contact food prep , My tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered three tacos without lettuce ,All 3 had lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The reason I'm giving this Taco Bell 2 stars is not because of the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the rice burritos and mini chicken quesadillas great for a quick bite to eat when on the go I think of taco Bell as a healthier choice or option when doing fast-food service at this location could st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delery for 10e Columbus st ocoee fl34761 4 taco's 1 chulpa that's al,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He also told us to pull up and they'd bring the food out,but you'll leave the same because you won't get your food anyhow,but I should have figured as much when your hilarious excuse for a manager stood like a deer in headlights when we asked where our food was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is NOT what comes on the spicy LOADED taco,I ALMOST ate the end of a freaking jalepeno that was found in the damn taco,The fact that I sat there to watch it get made and to receive such a mess like this with missing ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didn't have my change put away when they called my name and handed me a tray with my food,Jason was behind the counter to take my order of a Mexican pizza and combo burrito,The combo burrito was a touch,this burrito got messy ,It tasted even better with mild,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Employees need ti pay attention to the food they h,really wasted my lunch break getting food from here ,andle to the customers went on my lunch break to order food trough the drive tru  the got my order correct on screen and the ticket  as well order a combo 1 which is 3 hard tacos but nooo guess what i got instead a beens n cheese burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they cannot figure out how to spread the food out so that its mixed, Whenever I order any sort of burrito,a couple of bites of rice,One bite of meat and 3 bites of beans,a bite of cheese whiz, I get a bite of sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Took 11 min to get our 6 tacos ,the tacos were literally be wet,I'll go to Gulf and bye a friggen' 2 day chicken s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered two steak quesaritos and a chalupa combo with no sour cream and chipotle sauce instead,The chalupa's still came with sour cream and no chipotle,Yet we were still charged for chipotle sauce,instead of steak,I still was charged extra for steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
proceeded to tell me that he will not let us inside and we must wait until the truck was fixed and moved before we could order our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As they harassed me I communicated that someone behind me claimed his wife was the drive and he didn't care- the individual taking my order reciprocated that the food would be hot,The food was dead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got a chicken burrito with a BITE MISSING tonight (see pic),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know it's not authentic Mexican food,the toppings are just scooped dropped on in one spot (especially the beans ,and cheese),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I only ever eat there for breakfast which is delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually receive better food at this location ,In turn I received back a crunch wrap with no meat except a small,I decided to get a crunch wrap minus the lettuce,It's really easy to use and you can add and remove ingredients,but it seems someone had overlooked the quality of my quick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food never fails to be dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my party of 3 were attempting to order a small amount of food while the lady on the speaker was rushing us consistently repeating ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we just want our food ,She went to the counter and pretty nicely asked for them to be fixed (we're not rude to people who fix our food for obvious,when she got attention the woman working didn't bother to listen she just took the food to the back ,We get my moms food back ,didnt finish her food ,Her burrito supreme,just a burrito with meat ,and the burrito supreme still,Her gordita came out as just a taco,no sour cream,We ask for a side of sour cream finally ,and lettuce,,,,,,,,
but dear God the food was amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I read some of these reviews talking about how long it took to get food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The people who ordered well after us got their food before ours came up,Our food was announced for Jennifer - that is not remotely my husb,and Paul went up to the counter to get his food,but it was really Bill's food,"it's Bill"" when Paul didn't recognize any of the food in the bags as his", There was no Jennifer in the place to try to get our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's faSt food ,Good food at reasonable,I was not inebriated  but still had that  once a year craving for tacos,I  had a soft taco supreme , prices,and a chicken chalupa,It's delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their prices are,Doesn't justify higher prices ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How in the earth can you run an establishment that doesn't fluently know food phrases," and definitely you used old burrito tortillas to be my ""double",So I grew up in the taco era,had just left enough energy to mining my very own coins of the the back seat to afford these delicious tacos from the chalupa box,No substitution for better meat, there's crap that is just adding an extra ingredient to start the next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I agree with the long waits but I don't agree with the quality of food,the food we receive doesn't even come close to what Taco Bell tastes or looks like,so many ingredients are missing and what is there is subpar-not to mention it's a sloppy barren tasteless mess whenever we open our food,I love love Taco Bell and this is the closest around-but this is not Taco Bell food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and most importantly the food was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast food to go takes forever," Like I'm taking 10+ mins for ""fast"" food",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lady who gave me my food was screaming at her coworkers ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff is friendly but The food is always thrown together , Overflowing trash cans and food on the floor,Just not what you want to see in an establishment that serves food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Took over 20 mins to get a Crunchwrap and a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is exactly what you expect from either, Because I had a bad day and wanted some soothing bad-for-you food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 So around 6:36 PM and our food wasn't up yet,Somewhere way after 7PM we finally got our food,At this point we could have went to Orange City and ordered food twice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unfortunately the taco they sold me was a very bitter,taco shell,It tasted so awful I had no idea what was wrong with the hard taco shell,Maybe a 5 year old taco,I'm afraid to buy another taco,I hope their not serving old taco shells,It tasted so awful,,,,,,,,,,,,,
min to get our food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took them 21 minutes to deliver the food I ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In an area that is constantly busy they worked hard to get my my food on time while being polite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Prices are higher than any other,They hardly put any of the ingredients in your order ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I only ever eat there for breakfast which is delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've always been very pleased with the food ,  Today I was in a bit of a hurry and just wanted a quick seven layer burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tacos supreme with no sour cream,Crunchwrap wanted with no sour cream ,came with sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the food is definitely not worth,I have written this entire review on an iPhone in the drive thru line and am still nowhere near getting my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
took 20 minutes for food that tasted like mothballs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This tacobell always,or getting beef instead of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cold food,but at 4 in the morning I don't want my food to the window before I even pay,I called about my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We could have received our food,So then we had to inhale the food on the way to the theater,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chips ,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This review is a reflection of service not of the food itself,I went inside and ordered my food to go ,After about five minutes I noticed there were a lot of people sitting around without food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the food ,I'm sorry it's your job to hand me some tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just got three chicken burritos ,and I bit into all of them and the rice was over cooked on ALL of them ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you want cold food made incorrectly or your order to have missing items then go here,My husband asked for no lettuce because he is allergic,and every time it still had lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Took at least 15 minutes to get my 2 chicken tacos ,and they turned out to be steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No meat in the tacos that were supposed to be crunch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm very disappointed that I got food poisoning from this taco bell location on the 6th,And later in the night I ended up going to the hospital from being so sick from the food,I lost 15lbs from throwing up so much and lost lots of fluids and there was no ice and barely any of the soft drinks available and the staff made me feel like I was inconveniencing them asking for some ice which is ridiculous I felt like a bother and nobody should feel that way in any food place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pics are just a taste of how bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like their crunchy tacos with fire sauce,The lettuce and cheese on the tacos are always super, fresh and they are very generous with the meat which also tastes fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they would spread the stuff on a burrito the length of the burrito so you get a bite of everything at once,then all hard rice,then beans ,not all guacamole,and a few pieces of steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went the other night and all they had were regular hard and soft tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
g- ordering bean burrito getting a chicken burrito / asking for no sour,cream but getting a mountain of sour cream ),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:30 picked up their pack of tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was handed a bag missing ALL sides I'd paid for and missing a burrito,and then upon returning home I unwrapped a rice and been burrito that id asked for queso ,I ordered chicken as a replacement,and light beans,to be 99% beans ,and almost ZERO cheese ,The cheesy roll ups I ordered had almost no cheese ,plus the one thing they remembered to put in the bag had lettuce that id specifically asked to not have lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,
pull up to the window and pay only to be asked to pull to the front of the store to wait on our food,So we pull up to a parking space and sat there for literally 40 freakin' minutes for our food to come out ,we took our food from the fella that was working drive thru,) and sat there eating cold food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had to wait about 10-15 minutes for food as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I said "" hey can you fix it it's straight tortilla and I use to work at a Taco Bell and that's not how we made our burritos",I forgot to mention when I first pulled up to the window to fix my burrito he was st,""" The first thing he says is the meat portion is all the same",I don't care for the meat I'm just not a fan of just tortilla,I ordered a steak questorito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Soft tacos,smear of meat,served with ice cold cheese,kinda grey lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then handed me food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered cool ranch taco supremes which are like 2 bucks each and a bean burrito ,and i ended up with 3 plain tacos and a steak burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came home to all my food smashed,So on top of the horrible attitude I got at the window I get smashed COLD shitty food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she gets an attitude and tells me I ordered nachos with cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get hair in your food,& ALWAYS & I mean ALLWWWAAYYS get your food with missing items that you paid for,food ALWAYS takes way too long to come out & the employees are extremely rude,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And I'm sure it's going to taste great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The hot sauce packets were sticky and covered in dried food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Half of the staff didn't understand English and i didnt get my order right at least my soft tacos were fin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was too much food ,Just too much food,I ordered a $5 box which came with a burrito supreme ,and I asked for mine with no beans,my cup of nacho cheese was full,It tasted odd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for my food to have no ranch ,I asked for Doritos taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food seems freshly prepared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My taco supremes were what you expect from Taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food has been messed up once out of the hundreds of times Ive been her,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I paid for 3 Doritos locos SUPREME tacos ,and they only put cheese ,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Would drive out of my way to get food from it,Until tonight when I got food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was the worst Taco Bell ever I am in the drive through I order boxes tacos drinks everything I come up to the drive through pay ask for sauces get home to see half of my food is missing I called called called no one answered that was the worst experience the next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I should just go back and buy 100 tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Received the wrong food,chips were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's also one of the more pricey items on the menu,Just go across the street to zaxbys or right around the corner for Wendy's,Today was the first time I had been back to this Taco Bell in almost a year because the quality is usually so bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Mind you about 10-15 minutes later woman employee walks over and wakes homeless man up and gives him food,  I'm paying for my food ,and your GIVING a homeless person food who's inside the establishment I'm eating at ,EXTRA nacho cheese,  Nachos didn't have extra cheese,no sour cream plus EXTRA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didn't know when you order taco with just lettuce,no meat,you only going to get shell with lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Happy to report customer service and food have improved,food was barely ever serviced warm,food served hot,food tasted good, and doesn't taste like good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I still enjoy food,If I pull up at Taco Bell at 2am on a Saturday night I expect horrible food,Barely any black beans or other,I ordered a Black Bean Crunch Wrap with no sour cream or tomatoes, ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff not wearing mask while making food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast food to go takes forever here,The food ,The tacos must have been hot at some point,meaning that the entire taco falls apart once it opened,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast food to go takes forever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We are on diets and were low of food intake so stopped by,Looking on our app we picked the soft taco at 190 calories,I know it is a cliche but the beef tasted like cardboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food comes out decent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The meat you sell is one grade above pet food,the food is great,I'm having my attorney file a lawsuit against Taco Bell for violating my Constitutional and religious freedoms by knowing or have known your employees mixed meat ,You guys served us meat ,and cheese against my dietary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito ,and the taco,.delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Guess I will never go back to taco hel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stopped by a different Taco Bell to see if they had the newest taco in the menu ,still ordered their (3) taco & drink deal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took 24 minutes to receive my food ,There were three other groups waiting for food that somehow disappeared from the order processing system at the restaurant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 After you pick up your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the food has just been horrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They didn't place the taco in a shell sleeve so ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food,And the cheese was rubbery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They always get your drinks wrong and every time I get some hard tacos they're always Falling apart,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was as warm,Would recommend licking the pictures on the windows instead of eating the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" The food is ok",I am always amazed at the quality of service I get at the drive through,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
app said the food would be ready,The bag of food was rudely given to us at 2:28,After 20 minutes of waiting he said the food was being made right now,We had to ask 2 employees to give us our drinks and upon opening the tacos and burritos we were met with the smallest line of ground beef ,and a few shreds of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
forgot half of our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last time it was beans,Barely any cheese ,Every time I go you are out of a MAJOR ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I left without food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
beans were just okay,The chips in my nachos were fresh,the meat tasted a little more like beef than cardboard this time, and I have serious doubts there is any dairy at all in the yellow sauce they call cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Manager did refund my money and try to give me my food for free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While the food here was decent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was made just the way they did back in the day,Tacos were filled to the top and the food presentation told us the employees were trained properly ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overpaid for a bag of cheap tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Taco Bell is continuously horrible food ,We tried to be helpful and use the app so we could *hope* our order would be correct and we have been pulled forward to wait- no one even brought our food out ,and we had to go back through the drive thru and another time they pulled us and didn't bring us the right food or all of our food,The manager even brought the food to my car ,I called back and they were pretty rude and acted like i was an inconvenience because I wanted to right food ,and all of the food we paid for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Out of this world food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lesson learned: don't look inside taco bell food,nicely filling that bizarre craving for spicy food in the morning I get sometimes,I ordered a standard breakfast burrito,The burrito was unremarkable,when I actually looked in the burrito as I was eating it,"as if the concept of slapping eggs on a tortilla was somehow vastly different of a concept from slapping ""beans"" on a tortilla",that thing was absolutely delicious,The eggs tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,
Order was correct and everything tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So bought a burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Is there no manual on how to make the food here, Avoid this location until their prices and food preparation come up to par,burrito or fries at one location , I have ordered 3 chili cheese burritos ,a long thin burrito,fat burrito ,and a little tiny burrito-ette that looked like the baby brother of the first,  On the same weekend when my daughter was going through a chicken burrito phase,we stopped here and the chicken burrito was $1,My bigger complaint is that the prices here are 30 to 80 cents higher here than any other, I understand that some franchisees may price a little, You can get a mexican pizza with red tomato abundantly covering the cheese or,One of the basic cornerstones of the fast,and know that it will taste like that at any other,,,,,,
food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you won't have to wait too long to get your food,They have NEVER messed up even my most complicated orders and the food is always hot,The food you get is quality-- shells stuffed full,and when they serve the food,I can never get photos of my food because I always eat it too fast,never stale shells or nasty lettuce like some other, and fresh quality ingredients every time,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place was outstanding with their food it was fast ,Also I came here for the Fries Nachos and they taste amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We then tried to order some breakfast burritos only to be told they only had enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I'm also very disappointed in how much shredded chicken is in my mini shredded chicken,it looks like there is one lousy scoop of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
employees are always messing up orders or the quality of the food is terrible, food's always cold too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you want to eat real Mexican food go to a place I just knew last,Next time when my family and me feels like eat good Mexican food ,Yesterday I went to this Taco Bell Location and I bought 10 suprime tacos ,and 4 regular tacos,When I arrived to my house I was surprised because they just give me 11 tacos ,"the name is ""Chilito Green"" they are in south Semoran just between Lee Vista and Hazeltine National Dr and they are the best tacos I ever had ""JUST DELICIOUS ",and awesome tacos for sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cold food,even missing ingredients for the tacos,I know you shouldn't expect much of anything from Taco Bell but this location needs some overhaul on the whole taco making operation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the food was made perfectly on time ,a chicken quesadilla and a couple of tacos last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Almost 30 minutes stuck in the drive thru line only to get home and the tacos were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I told here no sour cream no cheese on my crunch wrap because I am lactose in tolerant,Told here no dairy at all I have a dairy allergy she say ok order still wrong after waiting 40 minutes i get home and   I have cheese ,and cheese sauce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco Bell just announced it yesterday so maybe later instead ordered burrito  & crunchy taco,Opted for drive thru was hoping to try the new pumpkin spice taco with new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I've gone twice in the past week and asked for ""beefy nacho griller"" and both times got a burrito filled with refried", beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Over the last two to three months service has gone downhill and almost all of our food orders have been wrong,The problems begin when the Uber delivery driver takes a photo of the food ,and explains that the food was wrong,pick up food service seemed to pretty much,"otherwise I fear all of our pick up food options will have countless ""Troll"" Roy D's",hiding behind their locked doors and screwing up your food orders with impunity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered some food,total came to $16 gave us the drinks and lady at the window forgot the food,Sauce from the the food leaked through the bottom of the bag,Overall the food quality is terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I discovered they had only given me 8 burritos,  Then I weighed the remaining burritos, My remaining burritos weighed between 165 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As I sit in the parking lot for my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Third time was the charm to say never come back and find your cheap fake Mexican food elsewhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but how do you forget to put the right food in the bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered the cool ranch and Doritos loco tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that by the way tasted terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They don't do substitutions - if I don't want eggs meat or cheese on it why can't I substitute that for beans or rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After 15 mins of waiting in an excessive line (caused by the painfully slow speed of the restaurant to make your food),so decided to try and change my karma and purchase all of their food for them,eager to finally eat my assorted grillers and soft tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Took 22 minutes to get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Save your time and just go somewhere else where the food is worth the wait ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were from the $cravings and it took nearly 20 minutes for us to get our food,but still get our food out at a reasonable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am always happy with the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's Taco Bell - The food is Taco Bell,The food is a solid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Look at all that meat in my picture,That's a ton of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then the food was packed so things were tipped over,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has taken way too long to get my food,The food is anything ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and then when I arrived to the window it take another 10 minutes before I get my food,As a person who buys food here I would atleast expect the people who work there take their job seriously,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,They were very kind however and I was asked how our food was,but I wish my burrito had more beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They always have new test market items and my food is always hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I stopped in there in a hurry to order a bean burrito, I explained to my co-workers and family that the meat (beef) tasted different,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It's like a pizza joint out of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I've recently discovered the Crispy Potato Taco and Gordita Crunch (add fiesta salsa),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were supposed to sub the beef for beans,as I don't eat meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I want my food,Got rid of the crispy potato tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My wife often orders tacos without cheese,At any other location she ends up fishing small bits of cheese out of her tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I like fresco style tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spilled food on the floor at register,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not to mention mine came with barely any cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first time we got our food ,Then we call the manager and explained we don't want a refund or to bring the food back ,Tonight I went to this taco Bell,"We called and they said to "" come up some time this week and we will give you three tacos"" didn't take a name",we go back and order a taco pack with soft,there was taco meat outside the tacos spread all over the shell,The second time we ordered nachos with no beans ,they came with beans , and hard some without lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast food is not usually focused on service ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a grande meal with 6 tacos and 6 bean burritos for a very specific, occasion and I got 6 tacos ,and 6 soft tacos which I didn't notice till I got where I was going ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The grind is when they come inside and put gloves on to handle the food without h,spit in my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It looks us 15 minutes to get through the drive thru for our 3 tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How do you expect me to eat fiesta potatoes covered in sour cream and delicious cheese with h,1 for crunch wrap supreme deliciousness (although they did think I'm ordering just an order of sour cream until I said crunch wrap surprise like 5 times),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Getting my bean burrito - done fresco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89 cent burritos, So each burrito should cost less than a penny according to their sign,When we asked to buy a few of these burritos they would not honor thier advertised,price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food seems fresh,one bean burrito is my favorite,Two hard tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With a non supreme taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food just tastes different,The meat is dry, and they act like the cheese is being expensed from their own,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I love spicy food,Taco Bell is at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to food ,- Soft tacos,I was able to eat up to six soft tacos in one sitting, I loaded each soft taco with two packets of Mild sauce,whether I'm eating a soft taco or chalupa, I like the soft tacos because they're simple," You can also ""upgrade"" chalupas and gorditas to include white meat chicken ",and carne asada steak,shredded cheese,and sour cream,shredded lettuce,The chalupa and gordita have the same ingredients: ground beef, Higher quality protein FTW,,,,,,
Fast food in the Burbs is where it's at,I'm not going to bother reviewing the food,Everyone knows what Taco Bell tastes like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went there to order their 5 layer beef burrito,and the manager REFUSED to honor their advertised prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so we're not talking ""real"" food",:) But for a fast-food place,Our food was brought out to our table,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I actually DO get the food I want it's usually always wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Their burritos,I've called it Toxic Hell just like the rest of us and bashed their lettuce tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As we wait for our food,The man was bothered he thought he finally had his food ,and told them they need to call names and not just hand food out,The food was good,They were very kind however and I was asked how our food was,On top of that we ordered six burritos ,but I wish my burrito had more beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't come here if you're expecting food within a reasonable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It feels warm between my legs hence it is predictably delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I recommend the taco pizza it is yummy,the refried beans are much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the 5 dollars special it come with one soft taco ,and 1 crispy taco I loved i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First of all: the food here is no better (,I know it's horrible food,you probably already know how you feel about Taco Bell food,it takes a while to get your food,You might witness just about any kind of personality and any kind of interpersonal exchange in the window between ordering and getting your food,I've seen people walk in and try to take a tray of food they obviously never ordered,drop $5 on way too much disgusting food that I love dearly,The way movie ticket prices are these days,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never had any issues with the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The past two times I've been to this Taco Bell I had to wait at least 15 minutes for my food,The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I got the California with guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food always seems like it has been sitting under a heat lamp all day,I go to the MLK one all the time and they are lovely and the food is always right,Dry crusty beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A crunchwrap and 2 crunchy tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We ordered 2 of the t3 meals [ taco Supremes ],We sat down to eat and discovered these were regular tacos with no sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Cheap food that somehow tastes really good, I guess if you put enough taco sauce on anything it'll taste good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco Bell not the best food for you ,fast and cheap food for a quick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its good for late-night to-go food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My favorite will aways be their dorrito taco ,and you cant beat the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you have a food sensitivity/allergy beware,I personally think giving a person food that they have an allergy to is a big,Unlucky me it was a crunchwrap so I couldn't see that the items I requested to be taken off were still there until I tasted them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I feel compelled to rate this Taco Bell on Morse Rd as I had the best experience of my life in a fast-food restaurant,One of the staff members (didn't catch her name) even walked around to each table to ask how our food was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 But honestly I truly enjoy getting my food that was thrown in a paper bag rather than a plastic,  There maybe was a spoonful of meat a cup of tomatoes ,and barely any cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-I like the regular hard tacos more than all the 'doritos' tacos,Everything here is pretty much a combination/permutation of 10 different ingredients,so everything tastes pretty much the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and 4 cars in drive thru and it took almost 20 minutes to get a pack of 12 soft tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food is as good,I also got a cheesey bean and rice burrito,a beefy Fritos burrito,and a mini chicken quesadilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wasn't even able to finish the food before I had the  god damned USS Gibraltar screaming out of my ass,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I aske fuhr 7 layerr burritoe,fresco beane burritoe ahnd a Nacho B'el Grr,dei charge me for beif burritoe vit beannze,I half two bean burritoes ,I got tree burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food quality-wise,sometimes you need food quick ,my friends and I storing 40s in the walk-in and getting drunk while we made your burritos about the least grotesque of the bunch,and you can substitute beans for meat at no cost on ANY item,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is always tasting perfect,I have gone to some taco bells were the food is not hot, & tasted like it was sitting out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to produce its food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
   The food is st,there's nothing like a chicken quesadilla ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited for an hour in the drive thru and then she informs me that they're not doing anything except tacos and burritos because they're busy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Since I always eat Chinese food ,and American traditional food like steak,so I chose this Mexico fast-food restaurant,And I was totally full after eating the beefy fritos burrito I bought,This price surprises me,fried chicken ,and salad,It is both delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco Bell is already pretty bad food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Have been in here for probably 20 minutes now & still don't have our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The foods good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the woman always checks to make sure we're satisfied with our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Basically all of our food had meat in it,Me and my friend are strict vegetarians and ordered 2 potato burritos with bean,and two bean burritos without onion,One of the bean burritos was just straight beef even though there was no beef to begin with,a crunch wrap supreme with beans instead of beef as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Low prices with good,Food is always high quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the Bell is one of Portland's many food cart success stories,A quaint little mom and pop taco st,the crunchy taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cheesy bean and rice burrito minus the nacho,cheese sauce is my staple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The tacos you make doesn't make my belly ache,your Quesadillas are the delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The new Nacho fries taste good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But you gotta tell them if you want chicken or beef,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I haven't been in a TC in well over 7 years (specially after the whole 'mystery meat' fiasco) so I truly don't know what happen to my system that day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place is absolutely standard Taco Bell food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He was very thorough and patient with us as we ordered a lot of food lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rip you off on food amount or sauces,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Impolite after I added an extra taco to my existing 6 tacos,After asking if that was necessary for a single taco,the single taco must have really put you over the edge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always great, and tastes fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 my chicken burrito was missing the avocado ranch sauce ,and barely had any chicken,My kids cheesy roll-ups were barely warm and the cheese was still raw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never been in such a big line and have it move so fast and the food of course was perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's tacobell we all know what we're getting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You're not making a 5 star meal just a darn burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 but it gets old having to go back and being half way through your burrito to find things you didn't order ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe 2 or 3 in the vege/condiment topping category and create a burrito or w,I think the best deals are still the half pound cheesy beef and potato burrito,Oh and 230 g of fat in one burrito,and 3 meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Taco Bell was very rude the lady gave us are food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The fact that I pulled up and was the only car in drive-thru and had to wait 10mins for 6 tacos  that were absolutely the nastiest greasiest tacos ever,It was so much grease from them being to lazy to drain the meat that our damn tacos were sticking to the wrapper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I believe I even had the owner hand me my food - really pleasant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality is below averag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These cheesy bean and rice burritos were eaten in great,homemade guacamole (I used to work at Chipotle),and I think I already talked about the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for the twist and for my food to be separated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its not about quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I' m loving those potatoes tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  Their food's the typical,shamelessly Americanized not even close to real mexican food,  The food's always up to Taco Bell st,even after the people on the food prep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My nachos bell grande with steak seriously looked like it could be in a commercial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My wife's food sat,Went to get the chicken jalapeño honey biscuit breakfast ,She basically said they won't be making anything with crispy chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Haven't even tried the food yet ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I saw they had the new cheese-stuffed ""puffy taco",they are quite pricey,the cheese baked-in just isn't necessary,but decided to go inside this local Taco Bell near the corner of Goldenrod ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fiesta salsa + that pepper jack sauce was so deliciously amazing, I do possess taste buds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm a paying customer who arrives 3 HOURS before you close and you tell me I have to take off food because you're a lazy,It clearly says your open till 4 and you say there isn't enough meat to make my food,"I can't feed my family because he doesn't want to ""make"" more food",I love not being able to get food ,Edit: got home and I'm missing two tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This whole time we were waiting for our food,The employee and her friends all ordered food,Our food was so sloppily made,my chicken quesadillas didn't even contain chicken and our food was burnt, It was clear that they had half-made our food in order to socialize more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 So this time we told them and they still served the rancid taco shells again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food has been wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I needed some food super,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even by fast-food st,you'd probably still get your food faster,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14 minutes for one taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The GRILLED stuffed burrito was not grilled ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not sure if they had to harvest the beans for my burrito or kill the chicken to make the new, chicken chips (which are fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food portions are a JOKE,I get the taco cantina bell bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So they give me the same order today with only one bite that had avocado ranch on that burrito,the chipotle chickwn burrito had everything ,and funny thing is i saw my co worker walking out bc he was in the Drive-through and they put no beans on one of the burritos,If 3 pieces of chicken on my chipotle chicken loaded griller that also had no chipotle,My shredded chicken mini quesadilla had no chicken on it,and the mini quesadilla had no chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always a 30 min plus wait and the food is always poorly thrown togethe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today February 23rd at 12:49 PM I walked into my house to give my daughter a Crunchwrap supreme and taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rarely is my food made wrong,at least make their food right,fix the problem ASAP instead of saying you're too busy and make them wait another 20 minutes for food that is still not correct,Sit back down to see that my chicken quesadilla has sauce on it ,They did not give me my side of nacho cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but ended up wasting my whole entire break in line waiting to receive my food,I ended up leaving with no food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is unacceptable and if I didn't have to load my kid back up in the car I would be right back there to get my food corrected,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice place to eat but make sure or order come with your right ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I work midnights so often I stop here for food,All of my food, The tacos are larger than usual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Either an item is forgotten or a special request (like no meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get our food ,The food is fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
decent food ,FAST food is taking over 20 minutes to complete an order of a mere,and cheap prices,and the *tiny* amount of nacho cheese on my nacho,and one item did not have my 'no sour cream' modification on the receipt,and there was still sour cream on two items I ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I mean the food taste like almost every Taco Bell there is,and doesn't taste bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it took *20 minutes* to get food in the drive-through,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I offered to buy it for her since I was in a car and they told me I wasn't allowed to order her food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99 worth of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also the taco I got had nothing ,but brown lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I can't comment on the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The shredded chicken burrito taste awful, (like chicken gone bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Supervisor the manager is horrible and when I called to tell her there was plastic in my food,This place is gross the food is nasty,Unless ur into plastic dibree in ur food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And we all know that everything tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheese burrito ,and soft taco sureme,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ordered XL ""Steak"" burrito got ground beef ",Last time told them no guacamole of course was on the burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spicy potato tacos had a cute,Add your own salsa at home for +3 ,verde salsa from luckys that my mom gave me,Eating cheese quesadilla now,googled up the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just waited over 30 minutes for four tacos and two burritos,but at least they gave me a coupon for a free taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't care about all the people complaining about how long it took to get their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you love burritos ,and tacos cheap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some days I've been the food has been fresh,I've had sloppy burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got my food ,and much of the food we did receive was incorrectly made (does Taco Bell even have a burrito with rice,and chicken,beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We love the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered one of their extra large chicken stuffed burritos, Just a small burrito, Thankfully I ordered a crunchy taco as well,would have been better off going to chipotle,rice,I was expecting something with chicken in it,stuffed with beans,and some bad smelling sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm going to start this off by saying that there is nothing wrong with their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do not like Mexican food in general,I guess if you like cheap terrible food this is the place to go ,The lowest quality meat ,and ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Making people drive back to exchange their food doesn't make it all better,Just get the beans and rice only burrito correct so my kid don't choke on the spicy sauce we didn't ask for at first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this isn't about anything but the food,I've been to other taco bells I know what I'm ordering and what it's supposed to look and taste like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but when I got the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The homeless guy that was inside having a taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Right amount of cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was here to try their new Doritos hard tacos,One of my coworkers planted the taco seed in my head earlier in the day ,2 Cool Ranch tacos,The staff happily corrected the mistake and let him keep the erroneous taco,Another shout out goes to my coworker for letting me eat the extra taco,I will say that if you were wondering which of the two Doritos tacos are better,The Nacho Cheese flavor gets masks by the flavors of the taco's contents so I couldn't really taste the difference between it ,and a regular taco,Cool Ranch gives it a unique kick and sets the taco off right,Not going to sugar coat it and try to critique ground beef and what it should taste like,,,,,,,,,,
ordered my food ,That's less than $5 worth of food,4 soft shell tacos ,and 1 hard shell taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love Taco Bell's food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was also good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I hate wasting food so otherwise I'd just suck it up ,I also know that working in the food industry SUCKS,so I physically can not stomach meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But as I waited for my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They're also fast at making food ,beans,I got plenty of cheese,I always get skimped out with ingredients at other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've mentioned a bad experience/missing food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited 10 mins only to be told they weren't able to complete my order due to not having the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered food ,Also ordered Extra Grilled and got my food Cold,Also paid to get my food redone,and paid for extra sour cream ,got it with no sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fair quality of food considering low,prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last week they shorted me a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My 2yr old spills her drink on the floor so I go stand at the counter where they hand out food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which means that the prices are a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was cleaner than any fast-food restaurant I have ever been in,I have particular food restrictions ,The manager came over and helped place my order (in a way that didn't make the counter staff seem incompetent which is a great quality in a manager) and they made sure my food was made in a way that I could eat it,great fast-food experience,The only reason I'm docking a star is because it's Taco Bell and it's gross fast food and the quality is never going to be good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thinking about doing a 10 day fast and my body is wanting to load up on all the junk food I can,Thank you Taco Bell for being a junk food/fast food gawd,Thank you Taco Bell for having tacos where all the filling doesn't fall out soon as I bite into it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff: The cashier was friendly and our food was prepared,so it's delicious,Everything was rather well made and tasted as it should,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Doritos Locos taco is a must try if you are looking for authentic Mexican food with an American,sustainable ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wasn't too worried about the wait but once I got my food I was very disappointed,I ordered a steak quesarito ,and none of the cheese was melted ,I also ordered an extra side of nacho cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Average food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Taco Bell so I can't complain about the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My number one pet peeve is when I order a crunch taco supreme ,and they give me a regular taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They managed to get one drink completely wrong and not include one of the food items,""" It was as if he was surprised they managed to get the food in the general",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered nacho fries and a bean burrito with fire sauce through the drive through,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20 minutes I get my food,twenty-five minutes total for food that was made,I opened a taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we ate it at home only to realize that I had cheese and sour cream on my food,explaining that we had to have our food had been made three times ,and that I'm allergic to dairy the manager said that the only way we could get out money back is to bring the food back even after our terrible, I would think it would be important to be sensitive to food allergies at food establishments ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took 7 minutes to just get out food,The food tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will say the girls taking orders are always nice but the speed of the line and the food quality sucks,We have to check the bag every time cause something is always missing or just the wrong food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I believe that I was the victim of food tampering at this location,What else did they do to my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my food with no cheese,They made it with cheese so they remade it,When I got home there was still some cheese on it ,and since I'm allergic to cheese I had to throw away the meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I then order my food on kiosk ,calls my name and puts a bag of food on the counter ,At least the food was good,That way a customer only has to wait for the food to be made,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food is always good and if they forget something they chase after your car ‍ Chick-fil-A service but at taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I was told by the drive through personnel that their food would not be ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went with a bean burrito ,I quickly glance in the bag and see wrappers for a bean burrito ,"The ""bean burrito"" was literally just a tortilla with cheese",I'm fairly certain I could go through the entire hiring process and new hire training process in the time it takes them to make a taco,"The ""beef chalupa"" was a chicken Gordita",and I do not mean a quesadilla I mean they forgot the beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
service is great and prices are fair,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got 2 orders of number 3 which is basically a bag of six tacos ,They were filled with meat and not overloaded with lettuce and they were like the authentic Mexican tacos you get out in Texas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always good,My only complaint is for the past 6-7 months or so they must have gotten a new drive thru staff because it use to be really fast and now you can wait 15-20 minutes or more at any given time to get through from ordering to getting up to the window to pay and receive your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you want some cheep booze with your cheap taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
People waiting for food were waiting for about 30 minutes,Takes to long and they have no idea how to make tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hubs had to go back to get the chicken enchilada burrito that was supposed to be the main,AND they also left lettuce on my Chalupa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poorly run and the chips ,and Mexican pizza had a severely bitter taste so we had to throw it out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It basically tasted it like watered down coffee creamer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service always is RUDE- food is always cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you go inside to order your food,you will not only be greeted with great customer service but you will also get your food faster,I love this Taco Bell and I will always come to this location when in search of a crunch wrap supreme or bean and cheese burrito I will be back after spring break,I have never had an issue going into this Taco Bell to grab my delicious crunch wrap supreme They have never made my order wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the taco salad without the rice,Should of choose taco cabana, they taste better and so are the prices,The chicken was bland,No taste to the salad at all,The most horrible salad ever,Did I mentioned the mango tea has no mango taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're better off going up the street to KFC where they have the new mac n cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every single time I've came here (after 10:00pm) I've had to wait a minimum of 20+ minutes in the drive thru just to get food,The owner of this Taco Bell needs to figure his shit out when it comes to him hiring good employees/having enough employees so people aren't waiting over 20 minutes just to get food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asking me questions about the food I liked at TB,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have never been treated with disrespect and have always been given good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Absolutely the nastiest fat food restaurant I have ever Ben to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco Bell has improved their menu and while the cost has gone up a bit the quality has improved by leaps ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I ordered a chicken quesadilla and two hardshell tacos today 01/31/2020 12:36 PM,The hard shell tacos were skimpy on the beef as well, The quesadilla would have had more chicken in it had they used a hard-boiled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80 for pico but neglected to put it on my tacos,The soft shell was also folded halfway down my taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos were fine, The tacos were lukewarm,and a small package of tortilla chips with cheese,There were little crumbly cinnamon things that had very little taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered 4 items from the $1 menu: grilled breakfast burrito,Also a good price for this meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast food joints are well known for their bad,The cashier refused to substitute guacamole in place of the cheese ,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this TB is pretty quick and the food is on par with other,on multiple occasions it took 30 mins from when I ordered my food to ,another time taco shells,One time it was cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited nearly 15-20 minutes for my food,and the hard taco in my chalupa box only had one side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It has to be the SLOWEST food service on the freaking,they brought me out the wrong food,I just left without my food (or my money) because at this point I was 20 minutes late,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" I wanted the ""beefy nacho burrito"" ", They said it was the size of a regular burrito, I also got my standard 7-layer burrito,chips,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you know what you're in for-dank food,Also the prices are too damn high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I then waited 10 minutes for my food,Once I finally got my food, I opened my first taco,so instead of making a new one they slapped the broken taco into a second,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Been waiting over 30 min for 2 beefy 5s and a soft taco ,Last resort taco bel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They stuff my tacos up just like the Taco Bell advertisements,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered food i was loud,and clear and i got a wrong order and food,Like you expect getting paid 15 or 13 dollars an hour to do fast food why cant you make me my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
making it one of the least expensive places to get some good Mexican food,but if you want GREAT Mexican food there are many,and I love their tacos and burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shut the window as soon as we got our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who on earth though she was a good fit for front shop work but I guess that's preferable to her making my taco's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They got my food order in wrong,and the food that was actually right did not taste good,The manger was a total bitch on the phone and told me she would refused to give me my discount that works at every other Taco Bell and refused to do anything about my food that was incorrect,there prices are outrageous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was surprised at all the customizing you can make on your order like removing ingredients ,and adding ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I requested a refund for the delivery (since I did not receive the food) I was denied,I ordered two beefy Frito burritos for delivery through grubhub ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 excruciatingly long weight for our food , after waiting 15 minutes for my food I realize what the problem was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I paid for my food with cash , We had ordered our food to eat there ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dropped in for tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It's not authentic Mexican food, I know damned well it's not authentic Mexican food,I go there because it's cheap and they serve food way past midnight ,it's not the greatest food on earth , Now someone pass me some of that hot sauce and let me get down to business on these tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited 45 minutes for my food,People were getting there food first who ordered after me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ordered a power bowl ,how am i supposed to eat a power bowl with no fork,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The workers are so gd slow it hurts and they literally couldn't care less what your food tastes lik,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the actual execution of food was on point ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Ordered my food at 5:52pm, Still no food,Watched 3 more people get their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are two people working the food counter ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all of Taco Bells food is made from like 5 ingredients anyway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after waiting for my food about 30 minutes later I had to go forward ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my food TOGO since this jerkoff decided to make my kids feel ashamed of themselves ,So I go and put my kids into the car after getting my food,missed one of my kids' bean burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There really was no compelling reason to get food here with so many,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The frito cheese burrito came with only,I ordered a shredded chicken nacho ,and it was all beans ,and cheese, bean and cheese as well,The quality of service is poor,There is no quality assurance,,,,,,,,,,,,,
People waiting for food were waiting for about 30 minutes,Takes to long and they have no idea how to make tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At least the food was good,I was forced to settle for the sweet tea because literally every soda in the machine taste bl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the drive through at this taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This time on top of the usual slow service the manager came from the back with my food wearing gloves then took my card ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hold the cheese,add lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- 3 Grilled Chicken Dorito Taco Supremes - all refried beans instead of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like their steak quesoritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Taco Bell for a quick late night food run,Still gave it a 2 though because the food is always average, Taco Bell quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I'm not really inclined to rate a Taco Bell on food,Taco Bell food is Taco Bell food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
needless to say I get all the way home to find I have no chicken items in my bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can't tell you much about the food at Taco Bell since I only ever go for the dessert,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Foods messy lettuce tastes like it's been out for 3 days this place should be closed down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is usually solid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a veggie wrap and when I got home I noticed it has meat inside of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my chicken burrito is tossed onto the counter like tras,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today at 12:44 I ordered my food ,and there were 4 to 5 people ahead of me so I understand waiting but when I saw what was going on behind the counter I started to pay attention and what I saw was the lady making my tacos put the tacos on the slider she put meat in the taco ,two cheese containers and still my tacos are sitting there not done ,and then she went to get my cheese fries and yes this seems normal but I timed it and it took ten minutes from loading my tacos with meat too starting to put them in wrappers, I told her my tacos were on the slider for 10 minutes ,and then left the counter which when she returned she came back with a bag of lettuce and cheese, She proceeded to fill the lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And hardly any meat or rice,making snide comments in the background about how she put chicken in, When I take 3 solid bites and don't find any meat in it,Over filled with cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most Taco Bell's aren't because they make the food as you order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" But while I was waiting for my food the ""manager"" if that's what you want to call him took my bag ",second time no meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As far as the food,TB needs to either get cheaper or provide better quality food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had an order number as well as an email saying my food was ready,He then came around the corner telling me that my order was not on his screen ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not sure what has caused the increase in quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The overall staff and food received here should be an example to what other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like the food,The only things I have to say that would be negative is they do very often get the prices wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is a reason why I ordered a steak and not a regular burrito,If I wanted a regular burrito,I would have ordered a regular burrito,No steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and handed us our food was rude through the whole,And what I am surprised is that they didn't even offer anything else like an extra food item for their mistake like other,food establishments do usually,My friend ordered a spicy potato soft taco with extra,we realized that we were missing a taco so we had to go back ,it seemed like they only put the sauce - barely any cheese or beans if any also the chips were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LITERALLY there hasn't been a time my food was made correctly ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can't tell you much about the food at Taco Bell since I only ever go for the dessert,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is definitely better food than the one from Kirkman road 100% of the times ( tested the theory,My fiesta potatoes are made flawlessly every time ( no double frying taste there),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went through the drive-thru today and ordered 3 tacos,I noticed the bag was a bit heavier than I'd expect for 3 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is the exact,The food is served fast,I really like tacos, same quality you would expect at any other taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I unwrap my taco ,a beautiful taco drowned in lettuce,She sliced herself while chopping up some lettuce for a salad,some Triple Layer Nachos and a couple of Double Decker Tacos with no lettuce,We've already had one lettuce incident today,I don't know why she was preparing a salad that early,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I decided to go inside at this location to watch my food being made,I was not happy to see the clerk ring me in and turn around and make my food ,and other food with the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service was terrible they always talk back when I take the food because it's cold,and thrown together these employees have no respect for preparing hot food,Or even basic human respect to selected customers I live in the area and will not tolerate this crap I'm not going anywhere and will keep telling them if the food is or I will write a letter to the corporate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After ordering had to wait 15 inexplicable minutes to get my taco and then they called my name and walked away leaving the food on the counter missing the cup for the drink I ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the basics - crunchwraps and tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have waited over 20 minuted for food,Today I waited 10 minutes for my ONE food item,aand there was only 1 person ahead of me who also ordered ONE food item,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went through the drive-through specifically asked to mark the burritos so we don't have to open up each one to find out who gets who's why is this so har,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had to return some food since they fried my burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came here at lunch starving and only had a hundred dollar bill on me soaked in sweat at 1pm ordered over 25$ worth of food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never had to wait more than five minutes for my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I told Lauren just to take off the rest of the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My taco bell here tastes like an empty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my coworkers wanted to come here and their infectious pleads for tacos made with hard,mexican and there are a lot of good places in Orlando to get a real taco fix but,I didn't hate the Dorito taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered #2 Supreme Soft tacos & Kickstart for my drink,Also my drink just tasted like heavy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ok first off we go through the drive thru and you didn't even give us the right food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chips were cold ,and some chips were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pretty average service and the food is alright by Taco Bell st,they gave me some free rice once so that was pretty cool,this specific Taco Bell adds more cheese to the mini quesadillas than any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the chicken power bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is cheap,The night manager wouldn't give us the ordered food or refund the money,She kept saying if she gave us the food,So we left with no food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am very upset being that I come here all the time and enjoy the food here ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually don't write reviews because I usually never encounter a complete lack of care for food like this,I expect warm food ,and the food to be served in somewhat neat,I ordered a 7 layer burrito,a beefy 5 layer burrito ,I discover that both burritos are luke,and a cheese quesadilla,I realize this is fast food and the quality isn't 5 star,,,,,,,,,,,,
No matter how u put it taco bell is taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is usual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First they did away with the double decker taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Paid $14 dollars for a bunch of tacos and i ordered a grillled stuffed burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered 24 dollars worth of food,They did offer to replace the food items,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These stupid fucking idiots fucked my order and I called and talk to a manager and she took my number and name down and told me to come in and get my food ,and when I did they question me as if I'm trying to steal food ,I said who the fuck wanna steal 10 dollars worth of tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a doritos loco taco that literally was thrown together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
) did the bulk food run,they forgot one of my tacos,One combo meal and I didn't get a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've already written this review I'm not exactly sure what has happened to it but it was a an awful experience the wife and I sat down to a dirty table because really what choice did we have all the tables were dirty so we went we cleaned the table ourselves and waited would seem to be a pretty long time to get our food ,when we got our food I pretty much,already lost my appetite due to The Man Behind Me mentioning to the young lady at the register about how disgusting it was for their group be a dirty diaper in the doorway which apparently my wife and I had completely overlooked I'm glad I didn't have the mental image as well but when I got my food there was the image LOL the wife went to the restroom ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My friend had ordered a crunch wrap with beans,okay come in and we'll remake it for you) then the employee claimed she saw the ticket and it had beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I finished my order and picked up my food at the window,"There were only two (2) cars ahead of me so I don't know if two cars constitutes being ""swamped"" but anyhow I order 4 items and asked for a substitute on my chicken burrito",no rice ,and add beans,When asked about the up-charge for beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They don't even put your food on trays even ,I'm only giving this 2 stars because it's taco bell and the food is pretty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Messed up on my order and gave me a half Eatin protein bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from being rude to getting order wrong to cheating you on the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This taco Bell is chock,substitute beans,I ordered a nacho Bell grande no meat,Double checked with order taker that there's no meat,Xtra cheese,Xtra sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always shit & tastes weeks old,The workers are good for nothing stupid kids that don't know how to make a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited 40 for food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got two bean and cheese burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It sucks that they refused to serve our mixed race group of humans for tacos for ""dancing""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A mile and a half down the road the same burrito is $1,Your value menu should not have items priced a $1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Give you a quesadilla with nothing inside they barley use the ingredients properly got a cheesy Gordita crunch and they barley put anything in their just topped with cheese like wtf your cooking skills are the worst food is made by idiot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of the food was just mediocre at best,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We got 12 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even the car smelled like burned food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no crunchy tacos,soft tacos only ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love Taco Bell's food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And they didn't add the sour cream I paid extra for in my cheesy bean and rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All I did was order two tacos,my taco shell was stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they told me they don't have a product but they can make me the burrito if I order it online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the pickup driver ordered my food wrong,The manager asked to see the tacos in question,She looked at all 4 tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered two frito burritos with no beans because they are soon leaving the menu,no Fritos at all what so ever and the refried beans made it close to inedible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Never ended up getting food here because as soon as I had space to escape the line I did,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they also load your food up ,and it tasted pretty bomb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why does it take 20 to 30 minutes to go through the drive-thru at taco Bell to get any kind of product, This is insane but it takes almost 30 minutes from taco Bel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All I ordered was 2 black bean and rice burritos,Each burrito usually costs me 1 dollar each ,when I got my bag there was one burrito,When I asked to pay for a second burrito she tri,"79 so i said never mind and she yelled ""now she doesn't want the burrito",50 cents for rice,50 for black beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited 25 in the drive thru today for 2 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not to mention their new grilled cheese burrito with the cheese grilled on top,As you try to pull the burrito off the wrapper the tortilla gets stuck to the cheese ,and you end up with rice,meat,and cheese in a wrapper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hope the food is fresh,when my wife said no lettuce they go ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not the best taco or burrito I've had,I go here because the quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How do you go from ordering food too tripping with the cashier like you guys are good,I want to thank Frederick J for good hospitality and making sure my food was prepared right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And something tasted a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is so great,Try the tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For the quality of Taco Bell food it is actually pretty good,I have had some bad Taco Bell food before,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but asked if they wouldn't mind wrapping them like burritos, I miss the Steak/Chicken bowl they used to have ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I like TB tacos better than Del Taco, I opened it while at the window and confirmed how little filling there was in the tacos,and the tacos were remade,it didn't' have much meat or cheese,but this time there was about 1/2 teaspoon of cheese and even less meat, The lettuce was stale,they were still light on ingredients, and tasted unwashed,,,,,,,,,,,,
We didn't get our food until 30 minutes after we ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do you think awesome food perfected in test kitchens for decades is not worthy,I will (and am) shout it from the rooftops that Taco Bell is fast-food Nirvana,It is undoubtedly the perfect road food breakfast for neat,and hashbrowns perfectly coordinated with the ever-so-slightly spicy Taco Bell cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When the food was done that girl brought the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From a food st,the food is acceptable,Having to wait several minutes for such food defeats the whole,"idea of ""fast"" food",When I want a couple of tacos and a burrito or a few,It seems to take several minutes to process a few tacos or put a couple of pieces of chicken in a box, pieces of chicken strips,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amazing drunk food," Would definitely recommend to those in need of ""Mexican"" food in the area",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was confused because I work in the food industry ,I stopped by after reading the billboard outside the restaurant for the rolled ckn tacos,When I pulled up to the speaker the tacos were advertised in two more slots on the menu board,I ordered for my son then I ordered the Rolled ckn tacos the cashier informed me they stopped selling them a week prior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
God I love trashy burritos, And tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
be it a yummy chicken Quesdilla or a sassy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Apparently cheesy gordita crunch reads as ""regular taco"" on the screen because that's what I got instead",Ordered a chicken quesadilla box ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went here the other day & got 5 tacos,Every one of the tacos had a little,The prices went up & they're skimping on the amount of cheese, pinch of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh and the food was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 But I'd much rather go to Chipotle and spend a tiny bit more and get much better mexican-ish food,I ventured out to Taco Bell to try their new Dorito taco,If if you don't like Doritos or tacos,if you don't like Doritos or tacos, The potential to try something like a Dorito taco is what makes life worth,the Dorito taco was an overall, The flavor of the meat and other ingredients (even without taco sauce) totally over powered the subtle,flavoe of the taco shell,it was like eating a regular taco ,if you are craving really cheap tacos,,,,,,,,,,
I got my food super,I ordered 2 Gordita crunches and a bean and cheese burrito to go,Then my burrito was horrendous,Usually the bean and cheese burritos,It was missing the taco shell,They just gave me a soft taco,It was covered in just some sort of nacho cheese and they barely put any beans in it, come with lots of beans,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I come in the food prep,this lets me know the food I get will be clean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is messy in the wrapping,The last few times we got our orders with missing ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mmmm/ yo quiero taco bel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- Received our food in a reasonable,Unfortunately there was no beef or sour cream on my wife's burrito ,Place hard taco with beef inside on top of melted,Fold gordita around hard taco,Walk away feeling competent enough to make a taco,how hard is it to make a taco,My chicken quesarito had the wrong,chicken on it ,and the side of guacamole we ordered was missing as well, and my cheesy gordita crunch didn't have any baja sauce or shredded cheddar cheese,It's not hard: gordita shell with three cheese,Put in steamer until it beeps so the cheese is melted, cheese,Cheddar cheese,,,,,,
The food was properly made ,- Received our food in a reasonable,Unfortunately there was no beef or sour cream on my wife's burrito ,Place hard taco with beef inside on top of melted,Fold gordita around hard taco,Walk away feeling competent enough to make a taco,how hard is it to make a taco,My chicken quesarito had the wrong,chicken on it ,and the side of guacamole we ordered was missing as well, and my cheesy gordita crunch didn't have any baja sauce or shredded cheddar cheese,It's not hard: gordita shell with three cheese,Put in steamer until it beeps so the cheese is melted, cheese,Cheddar cheese,,,,,
 The food tastes fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The foods not worth it,Thumbs down taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is quick,and yummyy doritos tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love me some taco hell,This taco taco bell is the absolute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are not very busy and we are having to wait on our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is so addicting,It took a very long time to get our food,Otherwise the food was the usual, and you can always substitute the meat for beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First the chips ,and cheese nachos were completely spilled everywhere in the bag,The worst part was the cheese cups were,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And my sister ordered a chicken burrito that had beef in it,I asked for a vegetarian salad and they put chicken in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They always seem to have a ton of employees yet the food takes FOREVER both inside , I also witnessed an employee take out the trash with rubber gloves on and then use the same gloves to try to serve food,he seemed to think it was absurd that he wouldn't want that food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The problem is when you order a bean burrito fresco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
be prepared to sit for a solid 5-10 minutes JUST TO ORDER and then another 5-10 to get your food *,where it took another 10 for my food to come out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tasted just like any Taco Bell taco in my opinion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they burned my burrito ,I asked for my burrito fresco (no dairy),and they put cheese in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A little dissapointed ordered a taco meal ,and one of my tacos had no meat at all,it was all lettuce n cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is either cold,I'm pretty sure my refried beans aren't suppose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perfect for when you're having junk food cravings at midnight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They could care less whether you wait or get your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How can it take 20 minutes for 3 cars to get food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service is always good and food quality is what you pay for,unless you have bad sense of food taste ADAM GRUDZIE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I haven't had to return any food or put up with any hassles like I've had to do at the Northlake location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go through the drive through to get my food ,and get home quick not to wait upwards of 15 minutes for my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Taking orders making food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only did I have to wait 45 minutes for my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst service ever literally only ordered 3 bean burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
while the food was still not great,all the food you get in the $5 box is INSANE,this kind young soul on the other side of the speaker took the time and had the patience to answer all my questions about the $5 box and made sure that none of my items had lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes that implies my food was pre-made,Did you know the fresco taco only have 130 calories,Between the moderately low caloric intake for a taco,and low prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just left there like 20 mins ago with a 2 chalupa combo and got all hard shell tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sure its fair on the wallet and you get your food quick,but remember no one goes to Taco Bell for actual Mexican food,"The convenience of their ""authentic"" tacos is something",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got my food ,but I didn't want to be that girl (or get my food spit in),and the salad (yes I get the salad at Taco Bell) has black beans in it ,and the beans were crunchy ,My Crunchwrap had a gaping hole where the lettuce ,I wish I took back my salad too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I've just gotten tired of spending money to throw food away,OR l ask for a cheese quesadilla and end up with chopped up chicken that l can't even pick off ,and then l discovered their cheese quesadilla ,and pintos & cheese,raw cheese,or a cheese quesadilla that should have light,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shawn was very helpful when my husband asked about the naked chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes I ordered a hot item an xxl chicken burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for my Fresco burrito supreme ,They still couldn't even make the burrito Fresco style,to get her two 10-taco bulk boxes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've worked food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Clean restaurant the new fries are deli and the regular crunchy tacos are always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food always tastes fresh and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and youre paying next to NOTHING for this food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Get up to the window and they haven't even started my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Multiple times I've been in the drive thru for 30 minutes waiting on food,Also last couple times I've gotten a crunch wrap there was literally two little chunks of meat in there ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My boyfriend had ordered me three burritos ,and cheese tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered SOOOO much food for a car-load of partied-out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They never mess up the order and are 100% accuracy and quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nobody could match that shopping and preparing food for themselves,A good excuse to not make your own food,The prices are unbeatable,Taco Bell wins in the taste-for-price category,We're not talking top notch quality ingredients but considering what you get for the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
including food,about food service being different,when we went in to get replacement food for what was messed up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 If we order 6 tacos,we get home and there are 3 tacos, There was sauce on my beef fajita soft taco tonight,Ever time I get take out from this location and I request no sour cream ,there is sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my food comes out fast ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Horrible food,Horrible customer service and the food is always wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The drive thru is where I normally pick up food from ,My food is always fresh,this and the tacos, and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I knew that the cantina burrito had more stuff in it ,and is the second time in this store that they gave me nothing but lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First I asked for the burrito that has onions- they said burrito,one beef and one chicken,and they were both chicken,Neither had onions or sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It actually might be the worst food place I have ever been to,The girl was rude and after looking at the computer for all of 5 seconds tells him they are out of nacho cheese,Waited 10 minutes before the rudest man I have ever met stomps up to the counter grumbles three words and guess what they have plenty of cheese,Yeah I get that it's just freaking cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Second time I went there and food literally thrown in bag without wrappers,Under cooked food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sub par food that looks even worse than it feels,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so we were doomed to wait either until food was delivered or the car in front of us gave up ,the window opens and the glorious brown bag of junk food was delivered to the customers ahead of us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he ALWAYS gets the cheesy bean and rice burrito,I ALWAYS get the chicken taquitos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Me and my family tried picking up food after a long,It was so bad that I told her to just forget it because I was concerned about my food preparation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get to the window to pay and she destroys my taste buds again by telling me they are also out of Baja Blast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I eat burritos from this restaurant,The bean burrito came wrapped in crinkly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast service and descent food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited an additional 15 minutes for my food ,and all of the food was cold,since most of the other Taco Bells can't get the food or service right either,the taco shells were broken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i asked for xtra jalapeno on my quesadillas got charged but NO jalapeno sauce at ALL on my food,i also asked for NO lettuce on my taco ,and they put lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they'll double up on the mystery cheese/spittle sauce and the lovely woman with the sweet neck tat will shoot you death stares if you ask for taco sauce,apparently it doesn't actually contain chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The one day in the year I crave manufactured food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So so slow The employees move in slow motion terrible service  no brew teas the napkin dispenser at soda machine empty tacos shells stal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bean burrito with guacamole,processed - bean and cheese paste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I simply requested a cheese quesadilla ,and instead it was filled with (barely any cheese) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on busy days during normal lunch or dinner hours I have had great service and tasty food,but some members are inexperienced in food preparation it would seem,forcing us to open each one so we could figure out which taco and burrito was which,Another occasion I ordered several chicken burritos that were served with rice ,I was really bummed when I got home and found that my burritos were missing the sauces that make them so darn,Last time my tacos were wrapped in all the wrong,and chicken only,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haven't screwed up my order and everything tastes goo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food sometimes is a toss up,It qseems like you get better quality food here during high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They lure people in to a looooong drive thru line with the promise of a delicious 1$ freeze ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco Bell wasn't selling cheap food ,other Taco Bell's I've been to have served food that was thrown together haphazadly with all the beans or cheese in one place ,It tasted fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Where does Taco Bell purchase the vomit they put in their burritos from,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lettuce and tomatoes are always old looking so I usually don't order my tacos with them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They made it with lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered 2 bean and cheese burritos,Another time they gave me a burrito Supreme instead,but it still had the cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just feel like their frowns make me feel worse for buying crappy food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 If your going to eat food that is made out of good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have ordered supreme nachos with tacos,tacos were as usual, crisp and delicious ,but nachos tasted bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whether it just they put lettuce on something I dont want,lettuce put hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know taco bell isn't real Mexican food,sticky tables and food on the floor,but I'm broke and I like tacos,I'll take my taco to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A staff member (a young guy) delivered the food at our table,this placed made the black bean burrito the best,I have been eating at TB since a kid and no place comes close to the quality of service I received here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are plenty of food options more appealing than Taco Bell,Got my food,and the issues are usually with food quality -- not with service,It's almost as if they turn off their fryers to save energy (resulting in almost inedibly lukewarm food),or food is cooked for much longer than it should be,and did my best to enjoy my usual late night Taco Bell experience: 100% lukewarm spicy potato soft tacos,and bean paste which tasted like it was cooked an hour too long,resulting in a burnt taste / incinerated potatoes,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These are but a few excuses to punish your body with tacos and burritos containing  ""meat paste""",The price is right,Kids don't eat meat loaf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One more car to go and THEN I'll get food,In total it took 34 minutes in this drive thru and that it totally unacceptable for FAST food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Update:: 20 minutes later finally got my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They ran out of chicken ,there was more sour cream than anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I got my food on time,Two out of four of my damn burritos had meat ,in my damn supreme burrito,they did not f up the other two burritos,and cheese,there was some damn beef and some cheese,I thought I was going to have a delicious time at the Taco Bell as I drove back from the DFM,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im sure there was spit in my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Asked for soft tacos with sour,What happened I got tacos made completely wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was delicious,I love the cheese roll ups ,Usually it's like tortilla with hardly any cheese which isn't cool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality is usually good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Get the nacho cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have no words and I have no clue what he did to my food ,The drive-thru guy FORGOT one item in my order and when I went to the window I told him the price didn't add up,The order tasted awful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is often not heated through ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or just want some inexpensive ready-to-eat food in bulk,There is not much to rave about on the food side- it's Taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband and I went late to grab some food after a movie,We left because I refused to pay for food that they would probably spit in anyways,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now i'm a Cheesy Beefy burrito guy (it is only a buck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My son ordered a ground ""beef"" taco from this location and ended up with food poisoning",The taco was the only food he had all evening,1 Beef taco = 5 hour visit to the emergency room,so there was no doubt that the taco caused it (,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was good,salsa, The steak quesadilla came with chips, I had a cantina steak quesadilla that I shared with my husband,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I also ordered a big burrito ,and it only had half the ingredients in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went ahead and left and got to my job to eat and when I open up my food the original,After that I finally got my taco and burrito,I had ordered some chili cheese burritos ,and on the receipt it says chili cheese burritos I ended up getting bean,burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The real excitement came when I discovered that it was the NINTH time in a row that I had paid for guacamole,without actually getting any guacamole,I don't think they even have guacamole,You order guacamole,I finally got my guacamole,"but they substitute it with a cup of white lead based paint that they like to call ""sour cream",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went the other day after craving a burrito & they were out of Chicken,Ma & they were out of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food not only is fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Drive thru smells like rotten food,Waited in line for 20 minutes for two tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Taco Bell says it's open till 3am but in reality they close at 2:55am so I drove 10 minutes for some tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes my cheese levels run low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Whatever one may think about the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Employees are nice but getting my food is a pain almost every time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waste of  7$ because I couldn't even eat the damn burrito ,I 'EVEN guacamole,They also add milk to the guacamole ,I went through the drive through and they forgot to take out the ranch and forgot to put lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fast service and food taste like it should,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The rating in this case is based on the people as the food is the same, The staff are courteous and the food is correct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poor customer service and food preparation,Then gave me the regular taco with spicy meat and the burrito supreme,If you look at my pictures of the ranch taco they put the sour,cream on the outside of the taco,Then gave me a bag with beans smeared on the side of the bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30 minutes later I got mediocre food,It took me 30 minutes after ordering to get a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and you get the food quality you pay for, The food was hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hate the bean burritos,its ok nothing fancy but i do love their crunchy tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited almost 25 minutes for food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The hot sauce is the best part of the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only thing that seem normal was a couple of their dollar tacos,Everything we ordered tasted like it has been left out ,Everything was really dry and did not taste good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waste of  7$ because I couldn't even eat the damn burrito ,They also add milk to the guacamole ,I went through the drive through and they forgot to take out the ranch and forgot to put lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" Not if you gonna put them on my burrito",How about trying to eat a taco salad with a spork,our guacamole is still frozen would you like some free,I guess I was supposed to stab the lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They lure people in to a looooong drive thru line with the promise of a delicious 1$ freeze ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco Bell is not known for having great authentic Mexican food, Decent quick food for a low, price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Taco Bell doubles as a KFC - maybe they should stick to tacos,I can get an entire 8-piece fried chicken dinner across the street at the King Soopers deli,1 *delicious* biscuit (that much was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and kept touching our food,The guy making our burritos stopped midway,I threw my burrito in the trash I was so disgusted,It took only a moment to wrap the burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A chalupa is like a taco except it's made with fried,You can get a chalupa with chicken or with ground beef,I usually get the chicken one,xx as well and is kind of like a tostada with beans,melted cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The way they present everything on the tv is not the way they give you the food you order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice of them and I understand but 40 minutes is insane for a taco Bell where I ordered three normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a Taco Bell and the food here is just as good,The manager of this place needs to take a serious look at their processes and find out why this 'fast' food restaurant is taking as long or longer to get food out as a sit down restaurant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,Also it would be much appreciated if they would make sure to fill up the cup of nacho cheese as well as not just stuff the napkins in the bag ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not really interested in up-selling or shoving food in you, It was cheap & quick & satisfying enough in the taste department,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this place is as predictable as they come for the crappy food fix that everyone craves once in awhile,Cheesy beefy burrito for a dollar,This Taco Bell location is no exception and while it's far from the perfect tacos that weird,Double stuffed tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is after I sat inside for 15 minutes waiting for the order and listening to the cashier visit with a KFC employee who wasn't even ordering any food,like the one in Denton Texas that are outstanding in terms of food ,So I paid $10 for two tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito I got was small,larger prices ,The Food did not taste like any of the other Taco Bells and the quesadilla had very little cheese in it,and bad taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is horrible,They don't know the difference between steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The burritos are wrapped very well ,and have a perfect balance of ingredients inside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ordered 3 tacos,1 taco fell apart,the tacos were pretty good,but just had 1 taco,I need at least 2 with these messy tacos,Spills meat everywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everytime i come here i wait atleast 10 minutes for my food wi,I litterally go to mcdonalds first so i have food to eat whi,le i wait for my food,Like how the fuck u gonna deny me food ,Idk what happened over the pst year but this tacobell went from being the shit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been eating their food for over twenty,how hard is it to get all the food I order into the bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stopped by this Taco Bell to grab a taco and a burrito only for them to tell me that they will be out of taco,That's like going to Taco Bell and then saying they are out of taco meat, meat for the next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast and more than friendly (offered to remake the fiesta potatoes for me because I didn't know they had sour cream),it's by no means authentic or quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited 30 minutes for $15 worth of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered double steak and jalapeño cream sauce on a burrito last,I checked the receipt and it said I paid for steak 2x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I opened it up the crunchwrap had no meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then to get the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their food is not natural,they are 11 and 9 and they love Taco Bell food,and we waited almost 20 minutes to get our food,and the children also noticed that there was barely any food in their wraps,Taco bell's food is very simple, my tacos were soggy,even i fit tastes good,it does not take much to prepare it and it can taste really good,,,,,,,,,,,,
We're regulars here and we are mostly happy with our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My beefy melt burrito consisted of tortilla,Where's the cheese ,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not rating the food,The service was fast and I got my food in about 5 minutes,The food came out correctly ,and they put the right amount of ingredients in their items,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The girl was rude and the tacos were literally 1/4th full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was a taco with a cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is still Taco Bell food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bean burritos without onions,the chicken quesadilla we ordered was folded in half ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and they are afraid to put any lettuce on their tacos,my soft taco is more like a taquito than a taco,get the wrong chicken,i know its very expense and i always ask for extra lettuce  they they thi,nk i am asking for a salad and no I just want normal lettuce not two sprigs,further more when they made my mexican pizza looks like they threw the ingredients from accross the room in a blob in the middle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not the food of Taco Bell or the chain itself,special requests were politely accepted (I like my bean burrito a certain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I have never had even one incorrect order or sloppy food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
c  I go there all the time at lunchtime just because it is cheap and sometime I crave a good volcano burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only were the tacos shells clearly old/stale,they forgot my chicken quesadilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like to put it in the tacos so that they taste so yummy,I love you full of cheese cuz I like cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the Mexican pizza they made me tasted like they had dipped it in cinnamon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A bad taco at Taco Bell (which I've never had) is better than a good,taco anywhere else,My only complaint is I wish they would come down in price to their worth of 99 cents,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't know why I lowered my standards but I decided to try the waffle taco for breakfast for the sake of curiousity,I can say the steak and chicken at taco bell is edible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Go to bean burritos made okay,Glad they didn't put cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The tacos are fresh,the meat is hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hot food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When it's 1 am and I can drive less than 2 minutes and have a 7-layer burrito with fire sauce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
modern interior and food seems to be consistently fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I had to leave the drive-thru window and go back inside to return the food it was so unacceptable,I got a taco with 2 shells stuck together ,1% meat,1% cheese, 90% shell (times 2) and then 8% lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food has always tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This taco bell got some real mexis workin there so u kno your food is gonna be on point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I've never been disappointed in the food, (I never eat meat at ANY Taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Out came a lady with attitude who told me they were busy and that they would be able to make my food as soon as they were caught up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited for about a minute and a half to get my burritos,Shortly after I was given three poorly made bean burritos,The burritos actually tasted quite good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A different girl came over with the missing food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cantina burrito: swing ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I order a Nicholas supreme and they gave me chips cheese ,and meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast service and good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality is typical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
needed food, The food quality was awful, The drink tasted like soap ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Decided to come here to get a gordita crunch and some nacho chips for her,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The feed you at a cheap price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the worst poor excuse for a Taco Bell ever the food the hard,taco shells are stale the food over all is disgusting its a shame how Taco Bell allowed this one location to tarnish there nam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Waited 30 min for my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a $6 chalupa box and everything on the order was correct but when I opened my food there was absolutely no meat in the taco ,and it took them 15 minutes to get me my food ,when nobody else was in there getting food,Not to mention the lady screaming at them in the drive thru for messing her food up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was starving stop by there to get a taco with just lettuce ,and cheese,tons of lettuces and cheese great,tons of lettuces  great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Already paid for my food,No compensation or free food offered except to wait the 15 minutes in the parking lot for new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always get friendly service and food received as ordered,I don't recall ever having to wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After waiting in the drive thru line for 20 minutes for a bean taco ,I received only the taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No sour cream or tomatoes in a crunchwrap is not a difficult, request when there are only 4 other ingredients in the thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything was correct on the screen (I was also asked if it was) pull up pay received my food moments after ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never had any issues with food orders from this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I could and should have gone to a sit down Mexican restaurant and had better food in the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Certainly with the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks for the disgusting food that's probably been left out since lunch time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do not come here if you want food,then refuse to make your food, I am sitting here (arrived 18 minutes before closing) stuck behind another car and I don't even get any food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Although we live a mile within this tacobell,Ordered a Xxl steak ,and they jipped us on the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40 minutes for a bean burrito ,and a crunchy taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Especially when the hair that was in my food exceeded the length of the burrito I ordered,but don't mess with people's food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but at least this route will get you some food,The problem is that it probably won't be the food that you ordered,"but I'd rather drive to a different Taco Bell to get my crappy ""mexican"" food fix",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After 25 minutes of waiting for $40 of food,It took 25 mins to make our food,These assholes tried overcharging by adding chicken  to a taco instead of substituting chicken for beef,Which is a 4 dollar different for doing this for 6 tacos,I decide to check to see if the order was right and when I open the taco there is literally 1 piece of chicken broken into 2 in there in every taco,So I told the girl to come over and look at it and I asked her wtf is the problem with the two and she was stunned I noticed and said it was a taco,I then asked her why the hell there was only 2 half pieces of chicken ,"This she actually had the nerve to say ""well you got what you paid for and you didn't pay for the chicken"" ",you did this in retaliation to me telling you that you're wrong and there's a substitute chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a simple order a cheesy bean and rice burrito ,Drive away and take a bit of my burrito (luckily I didn't get all the way home to S,I don't know what kind of burrito they gave me,but it had meat in it I don't eat which is the reason I order nothing with meat on it,and triple layer nachos add lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Also took about 15 minutes to get my food which was only two meals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Slamming windows and slamming down the food they make,breaking taco salads bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I just asked for my food to be remade,There seemed to be two woman managers that were so sweet and remade meal with no hesitation and even said I could keep my first order of food as an extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is heavily processed,I do like the steak burritos,Try the steak cantina burrito,Spicy chicken cooler ranch loco doritos tacos,The breakfast commercials are funny and the waffle tacos are laughable,the steak has real,steak qualities,I tend to stick to items that taste better with generous,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 14 year old begged me to go there to get him a 7-layer burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a fast-food chain--,' The food is ,even suggested changing the order to get a better deal on the prices,Thanks Daniele for the quality service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waste of  7$ because I couldn't even eat the damn burrito ,I went through the drive through and they forgot to take out the ranch and forgot to put lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But here is a tip if you're tired of paying for $3+ for a taco and burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""  This occurs when you use a non-front loading defense and they ask if your order is complete before you get enough food ordered",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most of my food was made wrong,The service was a little slow but my food problems were h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The time it takes to get your food just takes forever ,My biggest complaint would be my food is usually 50/50 made wrong,If its going to take a while for me to get my food,it better be because your making my food perfect ,Speed of the getting my food ,Any time I order a burrito,its usually wrong and my tacos are never filled with anything,Fill my taco up,and fill up my tacos,The amount of meat is the usual, but there usually is not much lettuce or cheese on it,Taco Bell is just addicting to eat regardless if it all taste the same,,,,,,,,
Watched him start helping and touching food with his gloved,I said something to the order taker that I didn't want him touching my food if he is taking money too,but a second person on the prep line started to argue with me and said he was fine and not touching food,but I just couldn't bring myself to eat the food now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by explaining it was half a pound of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hot yummy food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great food ,Terrific location for getting your crunchy taco on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
visiting this one is ordered about $14  worth of food one of which consisted of a drink,I get my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Workers are really nice and food is perfectly fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Delish bean burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the slow service at supposedly ""fast"" food is a Boulder County-wide issue",After a couple minutes I got my 3 crunchy tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Place was as clean as any other quality Taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food on the other,chips all over the tables ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30 minutes to get two soft tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 or three people have come back with problems with their food,I even saw some people that knew the coworkers get food before everyone else,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very slow service and the food is bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always hot,For a fast food joint or a cheap taco craving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not a care in the world and literally TOSSED my food ,my drink was incorrect and I didn't get my taco sauce I'm sorry,but who eats a taco without sauce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
   Wait in line 15 minutes at the drive thru for 4 soft tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would also like to thank the people who work at t bell headquarters for creating the chicken quesadilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is based off of the sauce to food items ratio alone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco Bell taste so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Almost an hour to get a couple average tacos is unacceptable,and all I got was a couple eyerolls as the kitchen staff begrudgingly threw some meat in a shell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If I could give no stars I would got a taco salad which is usually  pretty,alright and the taco shell had mild type,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Low quality ingredients and the furthest thing from Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wish it didnt consistently take forever to get food,Sad face because i really want to give them money for some delicious tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was hot, and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I expect to be contacted by the owner of this franchise because I will not tolerate being treated as an inconvenience to a food establishment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Simple order: 1 chicken quesadilla,uncooked) cheese quesadilla,"Just unmelted ""cheese",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service and the food don't really st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I pay for my food ,I do not recommend this Taco Bell unless you enjoy poor service and dismal quality food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the Doritos Loco Tacos combo and a chicken soft taco, The Loco tacos were lighter than normal,though the chicken was what was expected, on the meat,The amount of cheese was average, The lettuce (which they filled mostly with) wasn't fresh, Removing some of the lettuce (because of color),the taste was that as expected,,,,,,,,,,,,
and tastes almost sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Let's move on to the Dorito taco, The chicken quesadilla also never ceases to amaze me with it's cheesy,meaty goodness of the crunch wrap supreme however uncrunchy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They mess up the food every single,you'll probably get your food faster ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And is this how you're making tacos now,5 hours to wrap up some preheated meats in a tortilla,no meat,all lettuce and a pinch of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've worked food service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am a manager for applebees and we get well done steaks out in 15 minutes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She was snotty and rude and argued when I asked about the black beans,get some damn black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and received excellent service and above average food (as compared to a st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always tasty food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've only used the drive-thru around lunch time and have never had to wait too long to get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food tasted really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service and good food are incredible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
plus I asked for hot sauce and got fire then bean and cheese burrito with no onion ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place is a joke the service takes unbelievably long and  also forgets are food order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service was great and the food was perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All three fresco tacos came with less than half filled with meat,Our cruchwraps were broken and folded into the bag like a taco cause all the inside, ingredients to go everywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
People and food consistently good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
People want $15 an hour and can't even take the time to serve food correctly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food came out before i could even turn the corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a custom item and they got the no cheese part right but gave me a completely different taco not even the same, They gave a me a hybrid chalupa w ground beef when I ordered a grilled steak soft taco,meat that I ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their enchiritos and crunchy tacos are still above board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What I got: Everything with ONLY meat ,just one item without cheese,and cheese,It tasted worse than hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food came out 20 mins later ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of food ,I pulled more lettuce heart out of one taco than I've ever seen,and higher priced just because it's sw,So why are all the menu prices higher than any other,Horrible quality, location if the quality is much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  I Always get the best service here the food is Always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I believe I was served a healthy portion of food poison, Only two of us ate items with refried beans , The other two individuals not eating refried beans never experienced the love of the porcelain throne,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't even have my food yet,I don't understand how hat it is to put taco meat inside an already made taco shell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatever fuck them and fuck this tacobell,They tasted ,That shit tasted like poison,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only one car I front of me and I waited over 10 minutes for my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Been 25 mins since I ordered food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We waited over an hour for our food in a never-ending,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went to pick up my food that already has a pending charge in my bank account,can't get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those cinnamon balls of fried creamcheesey goodness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't give people bad food,even cheeses are NOT MELT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We waited almost 30 minutes to get our food,we had missing items and food that wasn't how we ordered them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have to order your food on the kiosk because theres no one at the cash register to take your order,my food took so long to come out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stopped here for a spontaneous meal of five regular crunchy tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good Mexican food is hard,The homemade salsa was served in a convenient little packet in which you tear off a corner and squeeze onto your food,I settled on a Doritos Locos taco with  ground beef,The taco was delicious,My taco came with julienned,Like the taco itself,The accompanying vegetables were every bit as fresh and tasty as those that were served with my taco,and a pair of steak Chalupas,It came with thick strips of marinated premium-quality steak - if I had to guess,a dollop of sour cream, strips of iceberg lettuce,and I'd been meaning to try this cozy little adobe restaurant on the corner for years,with a unique blend of orange-tinted spices and herbs that tasted vaguely familiar,,,,,,,
Even though Taco Bell is a shitty food environment,Shitty service goes with your shitty food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I passed out the food,48 minutes to the food replaced,They cleared that board before fixing my food,I took them along with the bean burrito I ordered for myself back up there,Its a good thing I asked for a fresh burrito too,Part of the order was 2 steak soft tacos with NO sauce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of the food coming out of this location seems to vary almost by the minute,I order a Mexican pizza no refried beans,When I got home I had refried beans on the pizza,I am allergic to guacamole so I always request my items without is it comes st,8 out of 10 times I have had guacamole on my order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get a NO CHEESE with EXTRA beans,For example when I want a 5 layer with NO BEANS and extra nacho cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited 20+ minutes for two food items while people argued in the parking lot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No food for any of us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Make sure you double check your food before leaving the parking lot,they shorted me a taco supreme,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a #2 and 2 casadillas and a fritos burrito ,and they gave me 1 taco for my number 2 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a guilty indulgence to someone who prides himself as a foodie ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I ordered a Mexican pizza with chicken she said it wouldn't be a problem,When I got home the Mexican pizza looked terrible there was no sauce or tomatoes on it and the chicken wasn't in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it takes forever to get my food,When I noticed my burrito was missing ,I got my burrito ,nobody in front of me as around the corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The lack of stars are not for mediocre food, I come here BECAUSE of the mediocre food,They will offer you 6 handfuls of saucy packs but forget 1/2 the damn food you ordered to put those cute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food we provided was good,He was really warm when I was eating it and very tasty and up to Taco Bell food st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He's likely got super powers to put sour cream on every taco and burrito within 30 miles,I fucking hate sour cream,Why do they put sour cream on EVERYTHING even though every time I tell them NO sour,Why in the FUCK is there sour cream,My husband and I have resorted to stressing no sour cream on these items,This Tacobell location is spot on in terms of consistent quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never enough meat on anything honestly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I kind of knew it wasn't because I hadn't asked for sauce yet but I took his word for it because I could tell he was annoyed by me asking and then I got home to see there was no sauce at all and they gave me rice burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast (keyword Fast) food people,Taking in the quality of the place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service received was great and the food was very satisfying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The chalupa is composed of a deep fried chicken patty that has been shaped into a taco shell,it's a bit pricey for Taco Bell, It is filled with cheese,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 he hands me my food , I tried to order more food then so he could charge my card , I ordered nachos and a shredded chicken burrito ,so you got an order of chips and cheese and a shredded chicken burrito, he I let him know again I ordered nachos with beef and a shredded chicken burrito with a soda,he replies again so then chips and cheese and a shredded chicken burrito, I got a nacho with beef then added a drink and shredded chicken burrito,after some time we finally figured out that what I wanted was called a nacho supreme + shredded chicken , he then says oh so cheese and chips with a soda, the woman on the speaker asked me what kind of meat I wanted on my nachos,,,,,,,,,,
the bathroom and dining areas are always clean and the food is 100% taco bell yum yum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However today I tried to order a beefy frito burrito ,and replaced the beef with beans ,Don't go here if you don't eat meat,It left a bad taste in my mouth about the whole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Connor was very welcoming and nice and the food is better than any location I've been to :-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got the orders out quick with three cars in line and everything tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I ordered a burrito which they forgot to bag, **CONS:  tonight they were out of taco salad shells ,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe it took someone ten minutes to get their food,I called it quits the last time I was here and it took me an hour to get my food,They also don't make the food in order,No food for you,You're going to have to annoy them at the counter to even get them to start on your food,For a few burritos ,and tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we talked about the taco Bell catina ,I asked her name before she left because I wanted to write this review and let her and you at taco Bell know that she is definitely an asset to your company ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she wanted  a grilled seven layer burrito, What we got was little more than a bean burrito,They assured me that it was a seven layer burrito,It was a thousand miles from being a seven layer burrito,they were out of the new double crunch taco,taco shells,No rice,Again no rice,a pinch of pico and beans,All it was was some beans,All my gal could taste was some beans ,Taco meat,and a  small dollup of guacamole,Hold the cheese,sour cream,It had lettuce,lettuce,and lettuce,was dollar menu thin and virtually tasteless,
Got home and the adults food was in the bag ,It was late and had to grab the kids a burrito ,and a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 If you want your food made just the way you don't like it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the Variety Taco Party Pack or whatever it is called and when I got home I found out that I actually just got  a bunch of regual tacos,Then after further investigation over half of my tacos were smashed ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the staff always have attitudes and the food is cold,I've had several times where I'm in drive thru and getting my food ,When she handed me my food,my food was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the second time I've had a bone such as this in my damn burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only was there almost no beans in it,but he asked for guacamole with it,He got charged for it only for them to not put any guacamole in it,it was basically like 90% tortilla and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything was cooked to order and tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've ordered from big chain restaurants and had chefs finish my order and in the bag waiting for me in less time than it takes to get my food here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we swung by and the little girl at this place said they weren't serving food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
time and time again should mean that a better quality staff needs to be hired,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grilled cheese burrito,all had little to no meat in there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my dad and a little girl complaining about their food to these people meanwhile the cooks are basically telling them/us tuff luck plus the first,guy still waiting on his food,"The next thing you know this little girl is going up to the cashier and saying ""there's something crunchy in my burrito I think there's onions"" ","and then the lady who didn't even make it straight up told the girl ""no honey I didn't put onions in your burrito"" ","peaks over the counter and says ""excuse me theres onions on my burrito""  even though this was a bad",Then my dad was talking about how he didn't really care for his nachos because the beans were burnt and then half way through realized the chicken he ordered wasn't on there,There was soo much poor quality about this experience in such,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm tempted to report them because who knows what else they aren't doing that could end up causing food poisoning etc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's the closest food to my work so sometimes I have no choice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thirty mins for 3 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only did he make my food quick ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On this visit ground beef was so watery it soaked through any type of soft shell or hard taco shells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I pulled up to the window the employee asked me to pay for food I didn't order because I couldn't order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible attention to ordering kept giving me beef crunch wrap supreme when I kept coming back and ordered chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Taco Bell is the only ""fast"" food I will eat",Waited another ten for the food,This is a very convenient location right on Barbur that is on my drive home but if I'm ever working late and need some food,opened my potato taco to put some sauce ,And I had two more potato tacos the same,and half filled tacos are not my thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food tasted freshly made,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Horrible food,You risk getting food poisoning or cold,stale 2 day old food,Always cold food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These guys couldn't even get 1 crunchy taco right,10 minutes while I stared at my made single taco sitting on the counter waiting to be h,The guy finally hands it to me and it had sour cream on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I work in food service industry ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We usually just get a simple taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not only did we have to wait over 10 minutes for our food,not a small burrito,The ground beef was definitely not up to temp when it was made into soft tacos,The chicken chalupas had pico de Gallo on them,The Mexican pizza had spilled all its ingredients in the box,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my son and his friends waited for 25 minutes to get their food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just waited more than fifteen minutes for a bean and cheese burrito,It has rice ,and the wrong kind of cheese (nacho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the manager who was already helping in the food line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I did get my burrito it was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cold food,is one of the very few fast food joints where someone who doesn't eat meat can get a decent (yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location the food is always hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I want to be able to count on tbell for food source ,So from a hungry customer who has to work a 12 hour over night shift with out food please resolve this issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and still be waiting for my food,"They need to drop the ""fast"" and just call it ""food",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I must say their nacho fries need some work and they needed to be served with more cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well atleast they warn you their food will take 15-20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is a mexican food cart parked outside the valero on hamilton road all the time,In quite possibly the worst craving for a spicy taco I ever had,"This place takes ""taco hell"" to the next",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One time the fillings for a taco were on the outside of the taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're going to get taco bell food,great customer service and great food every time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not like I didn't warned her about the overprocessed meat that Taste weird ( maybe from grinding it too fined) to me I call it dog food,Her food were old,The workers can keep the food,I wondered if the workers were taking shit loads oof the food that was suppose,the grand taco probably had like 1 tbsp of ground beef from end to end,They will  serve you days old meat late,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEVER gets my food right ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't place steak in my chalupa tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEVER gets my food right ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You know the food so this is about the location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the food was good/order correct,and you can't beat the prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was hot, and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They've figured out an ingenious system of calling your name when your food is ready,get ready for a little 'sticker shock' - they don't provide the best service and best food in town on the cheap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff here is very unprofessional the manager Marissa handled the situation very unprofessionally I will never be back here at this taco Bell I didn't get what I ordered the order didn't come out right,and nobody seemed to be confident enough to handle a minor situation I don't know how these people have a job here at taco Bell boo for taco Bell if I could leave zero Stars I woul,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The last 3 visits I say no beans on my supreme ,and theres nasty gross disgusting beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Fu-kers never offered an apology and charged me for my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not sure I can recall the last time I even had a taco here since there are so many,but I recently discovered the power menu bowl ,The chicken version is my bowl of choice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are quite pricey,I saw they had the new cheese-stuffed,the cheese baked-in just isn't necessary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is so much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Taco Bell should be compared to other fast-food outlets ,some tacos for our daughter,my hard-shell tacos were full,quality and quantity for the price was better than other,tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worlds slowest taco,Update: they are awful they forgot 4 of our tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
packed full of taco meat,which I added to the taco ,cheese,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
soft taco ,Upon arriving home i noticed my chalupa had chicken on it not beef,I ordered a beef chalupa with no sour cream,I was told they had already remade my chalupa and I asked for my receipt and when I got home I noticed the bag had 2 chalupas not 1 and they both had sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get home they only had cheese beef ,and tomato in it ( usually it has sour cream on the middle) ,one of them we're fine just wish it had sour cream ,but the other quite literally made me sick (the tortilla  had a strange taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How difficult is it to put cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know there is better authentic food in the area,stale chips,meat from a caulking gun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered about $35 of food ,and we were told to wait around the corner for our food,After a few minutes a worker came out with our order and gave us what she said was all of our food,We got home and realized she had literally only given us half of our food,We called to have our order cancelled or to be reimbursed for our missing food,and offered no solution for their mess up except for us to drive all the way back to get our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And I'm in shape but limit myself on this awful yet delicious food,Um yeah it makes my stomach hurt sometimes but I return because its delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has happened on multiple occasions and they even forget my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food tasted like Taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you want tacos,Replace the meat with beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After arriving home with the food ,I just wanted some food I like before having to fast for 48 hours,I discovered that both of the VEGGIE bowls had steak in them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which came with a soft taco ,the premium price dissuaded me,grilled chicken,refried beans,fresh salsa,and tasty chips,sufficient meat,and a tasty guacamole sauce on top,or grilled steak,It was the steak that was advertised,they come with both sour cream,,,,,,,,,
So I ordered the number 6 the meal with the 2 chalupas and 1 taco ,and the chalupas come with chicken so instead of the chicken I wanted the substitute the chicken for beef ,but of course they made my order wrong and didn't do the substitute so I was left with these chicken chalupas ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are so dang slow and the food was dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lower your standards and it will taste great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh hell no we came here and the worker Mia spit in our food ,and we seen it then she got an attitude when we said we want our money back she said no I didn't do shit to your food so we asked for her manager ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We received only half of the food we paid for,and the food that we DID get was cold,and missing ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was pretty Mad to find my rolled chicken tacos were cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bonus- I always substitute beans for the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the syrup for the Baja Blast was out so it tasted like lesser than La Croix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So now we are going to be late and we have no drinks to wash down our food,and I couldn't order one of the standard items because apparently they took pintos n cheese off the men,because I knew that filling pintos n cheese is fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love going south of the boarder for their creative usage of a minimal lists of main ingredients ,"The manager stated she ""carefully proportions"" out the ingredients",a mostly flour tortilla with a smothering of some of those main ingredients I mentioned,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came here one hour before they closed and they said they only had beef and beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the taco supreme I ordered was served to me with a broken,taco shell,It looks like they tried to fix it by putting it in a new taco shell,The taco was good,The manager of this location is quite stingy with taco sauces because they don't place them out so customers can get them - you have to ask the employees to h,although there was much more diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce than seasoned beef,I was hoping to be a unicorn ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
out of taco shells,out of beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked no sour cream ,and right when I got my order I saw sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ignoring us and the three other cars that were trying to get food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited 15 minutes in the drive thru for my food (only 1 car ahead of me which left quickly,When I paid for my food,the first girl opens the window and gives me my food,I realized they gave me a burrito instead of the nachos I ordered,There was melted cheese on the outside of the bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But anytime I go I'm just super disappointed with their cheesy potato burrito,Meaning they taste old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They got my order right and the food was tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got my order wrong and food was super,Unfortunately including the nacho fries were old and tasted like it had been sitting for days which was the only,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was not supreme at all there was no sour cream in either of them and my burrito supreme had a huge,Soo Tonight I worked all day and my son wanted a taco snack ,) I ordered 2 crunchy tacos ,The crunchy taco order only had one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was the hottest I've ever gotten from a Taco Bell,perfectly crispy potatoes in the taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My friend and I stopped at Taco Bell we ordered 6 items and while ordering our food the person working drive through wasn't listening well then ,When we finally got our food the nacho,they screw up a simple order or the food is cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The kitchen was extremely dirty food ,Don't ever eat at this Taco Bell came here because I heard they were discontinuing the pizza ordered a # Mexican Pizza meal and a bean burrito add beef & extra, Then I looked at my bean burrito ,then when I received my meal there was barely any ingredients on the pice one slice had nothing on it except cheese ,and sauce on top the shells they were on tasted burnt ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The burrito was warmish,went directly home - the tacos were ice, The chrunchy taco was soggy from sitting around,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" This is Taco Bell's ""biggest food innovation of the year"" ",which came with 2 hard tacos ,This new chalupa is meant to satisfy your cheese desires ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Decent food,Always good food, Taco Bell is always good about their tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had the Crunchwrap Combo with hard-shell taco ,my hard-shell tacos were not quite as full, Food quality and quantity for the price was very good,which apparently replaced their bowls,still tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doing their best to make delicious food for many,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is exactly the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food orders were correct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They gave me the fastest burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You never disappoint and always come through with the delicious food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered 8 tacos,what I got was 6 tacos ,Much better quality at Baseline,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food spectacular ,we have a burrito too with just a little,three of ours tacos with just cheese, bit of cheese and full of beans, and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Did we order a lot of tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can't give their imitation of a steak burrito,I ordered a steak burrito,a mixture of sour cream/rice/cheese,rice,and beans,There is a very clear description between ground beef and steak,real slices of steak,Instead I received a steak quesarito,cheese,It suppose to be sour cream optional,,,,,,,,,,
If I wasn't still hungry I'd find it absolutely hilarious but unfortunately my order was also missing an entire taco ,my Gordita crunch literally had less than a tablespoon of meat in it,And most all of that is in one small corner and there's NO meat in the middle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just got back from getting some food from Taco Bell,Then when I had them give me the rite food I had my sheesey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And then we had to wait even longer at the window because they didn't even start making our food yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I understand the foodservice industry, The foods always good,I've found at some locations their beans are dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered online because of the free delivery promotion got a whole bunch of tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we all love it (for the most part) I don't need to tell you about their menu or their prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight for example they forgot 4 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was prepared horribly too, Must be a meat shortage because the tacos ,and other things only had a spot of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it took 10 minutes for me to be served two tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worlds slowest taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
) I ordered the Pineapple Freeze and a simple taco,and the taco was just what I needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my food over the app ,It had no dairy or meat ,(Other locations I've been to would gob sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when we pulled up to pay she had her mouth full of food,I was almost afraid to eat my taco salad after that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is served sandwiched between two halves of a pan-fried flour burrito shell, The quesadilla is composed of deep-fried chicken nuggets, Both were packed full of meat,cheese,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They kept taking orders from people but didn't even have the actual food in stock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited in the drive thru for about 15 minutes for my black bean crunch wrap with chipotle sauce ,I said to the boy can you make sure they put the chipotle sauce ,In which I replied yes -- I ate through half of the overly filled with lettuce crunch wrap to find not one jalapeño and no chipotle sauce,and jalapeños only to drive away biting into a regular ground metal meat crunch wrap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight is the first time in a long time that they didn't make an error on our food,My husband and I both ordered Taco Bell and got our food within 5 minutes,We got our food before before the couple before us did,no employees should've left until the restaurant until she got her food,When we left that drive thru had at least eight cars deep & two on the side waiting for their food,""" It's now 20 minutes later and she still doesn't have her chicken tenders - she got frustrated and started eating her husbands extra taco",Cmon how difficult is it to make tacos/chicken ,"His wife's chicken tenders were still ""cooking",,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food never disappoints,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I order a beef burrito supreme without bean, I get a bean burrito 1 out of 3 times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went to this location and ordered chicken nachos,Took my order home and there was absolutely no chicken whatsoever on my order ,Seems like it would be very hard to forget to put chicken on an order of chicken nachos,and hardly any beans at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the worst experience that I've ever had in general with any food industry,Taco Bell has great options for modifying their menu due to diet restrictions and food allergies,I ordered my food ,food allergies,If you have any type of food allergy,I ordered the triple layer nachos fresco style and a Mexican pizza fresco style as well with refried beans as a beef substitute,etc and that I need beans substituted for beef,I opened up the shell and after dissecting the pizza (see attached photos) to my horror I realized that mixed into the beans were r,Taco Bell's beans do not contain lard,I had my friend try a bite (who has no dietary restrictions) and he told me that it tasted like it had meat mixed,specifying that when I order fresco style I mean no nacho cheese,A few bites into the pizza I realized that something wasn't right and that it tasted,,,,,,,,
The gordita crunch was supposed to be no lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I order my food ,Sadly this wasn't the only problem it took us 30 minutes to get 6 tacos now I haven't worked at a fast,food restaurant but I think 30 minutes for plain 6 tacos shouldn't take that long,-chicken,-guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a beefy supreme burrito,This taco is super,And there was no beef in it just sour cream ,They are more expensive than other Taco Bell's and let me say again the portions are super tiny you jut get a flour tortillas with extra sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Being extremely allergic to sour cream,I make that aware yet I am still served with sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The tacos weren't as crunchy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Taco Bell must be broke tortilla with cheese sauce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The tacos we ordered were soggy,I feel sick after eating two tacos I didn't finish my meal,The meat tasted foul,and came with no cheese,the lettuce was soggy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I also tried one of their new burritos (minus the rice), So it was a very anemic burrito , Without the rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service here is great and the food is always accurate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fresh,and reasonably priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I asked that it be switched to the regular tacos (I cannot have sour,I had gotten the supreme taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They shorted the quantity of nacho fries and half filled all of the cheese sauce containers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I sat in line for 15 minutes to order order my food ,and then get told I can't use my husband's debit card because we don't have the same last name highly upsetting I would like to know when this policy change was because I've use that card there all the time and then to be stuck in line and not even be able to order my food is ridiculou,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1 don't allow outside food or drinks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Laziest people work here went to get food after work ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
poor quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This better be the best damn soft tacos that has ever entered my mouth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Took FOREVER to make my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but these employees are wasting a ton of food ,1 bean burrito,After showing them the receipt and giving them the taco and burrito back,bean burrito,one soft taco,Order 2 comes out as the same taco,1) chicken griller,Order 3 eventually comes out and it included two chicken grillers (remember,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had to wait 20 minutes to get my food which happened to be old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Still hungry and wanting Taco Bell I ordered a bean burrito,I ordered a Crunchwrap with beans instead of beef ,and it had BOTH I didn't even notice at first because the beans disguised it,an item that had no meat,I accidentally ate meat twice tonight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They just forgot that we were there waiting for our food,items that we paid extra for alterations like guacamole were paid for but we were given the regular burrito,this taco Bell is kind of our hotspot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I'll be damned if I have to pay more than $1 for a taco,I get a hybrid slurry of chicken paste product,there it is: a tasty bag full of half-a-dozen different combinations of beans,cheese,I love my local Taco Bell at the corner of ab,but once I round the corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered two nacho boxes and it looks like they ran out of chips,and we barely got a handful of chips ,and a crap ton of over cooked meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We also requested a bean burrito no onions guess what we got onions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I had to either choose chicken or steak,beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fake food that tastes fine,I mean it's fine I like a couple things on the menu and who doesn't crave junk food now ,I can't bring myself to give Taco Bell 5 star cause it's not real food ,a chicken burrito,My crunch wrap was closed correctly and tasted as should,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've received tacos that do not have ,and meat on them what's so every,I'm not paying for lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Usually the Taco Bell's I go to the customer service isn't great and the food is thrown together,They're kind and the food is actually put together very nicely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So since my yelp friend Paul reminded me it was taco Tuesday ,I hate having taco shells broken,don't mess with my tacos,People don't like their taco shells broken if they did they would order a tostada instead,I purposely order them without lettuce so they are not so filled up that they break,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No complaints about the food or speed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trash food always old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And all of the other food was dry,a burrito,a soft taco,No soft taco,no meat & sloppy,2 nachos and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The last two times I've been here the food has been pathetic,00 for almost no meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good flavor and polite most of the time but Nachos are too often served with crumbs instead of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
heard there was a new burrito,The chicken chipotle burrito isn't even a burrito,It's in a flour taco tortilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every single time I order cheesy bean and rice burritos (from the VEGETARIAN menu) they have meat in them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We were given a beef chalupa in place of a 7 layer burrito,spicy potato tacos,The quesadilla was cold and the cheese wasn't even melted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They got my order right and the food was tasty,The chalupa and burritos were good,Basic taco was not worth,Mexican Pizza was half beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was waiting for a half hour for my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After waiting 18 minutes we were expecting all of our food ,a dollar taco,They forgot a Crunchwrap and the taco,they have bomb chicken nuggets ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All that's left is to put the right food in the bag ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll admit it - I love the food,Make sure you check your food BEFORE driving away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Go to any other food place other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this was the worst fast food restaurant I have ever purchased food from,1 star because I like the food,but the popcorn chicken combo usually wins out,More than once I have had to sit and stare through the glass window after giving them my money for over 5 minutes before getting anyone's attention - no explanation for delay offered- turns out that they were frying more chicken,No forks given when I ordered mac and cheese with a meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was slapped together with no care also if you have a sign up in the window that says open at 7am then you don't open until 730am maybe the sign needs to be removed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff is really friendly they always care and the food comes out fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Swear I could taste it in the food it smelled so strong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My fresco bean burritos were perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Beans were overdone on burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a Taco Bell and you are going to get Taco Bell food late at night ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place sucks they over filled my drink split it all over the place in the drive threw and just handed it to me they take forever when you have not a lot of food ,and then not only did all that happen but I get my food ,and it's wrong had to go back and get the right food ,and they still don't want to make it and take the longest time to make one thing I would just stay far away from here the food is not that great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Waited at the counter for a solid 2-3 minutes for a cashier at 5pm on a weekday (wish the counter was furnished with a taco ""bell""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst drive thru ever I've never had to wait 15 min in a drive thru and that's just to order my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's the same food as every Taco Bell ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they actually put cheese on the tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you literally gave me 3 hot sauces for 15$ worth of food split for 3 people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst Taco Bell food I have ever had,I've been here about 5 times over a course of 4 years because this is the only place in the South Shore that tastes remotely like Tex Mex food, The tacos/gorditas/etc, There is hardly any meat in them too, I think they pre-make them and keep them under a weak heating lamp because the letttuce is always withered and melted into the cold hard cheese goup that was once hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There were 4 people waiting for food,"Everyone ended up with ""we don't want any food",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Which means only tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast food,tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other then that decent junk food plac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mmmmmm tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Says it closes at 4am but shuts the grille down at 3am which means you can't order anything but tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I have come home twice to find that a burrito is missing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is cheap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I understand that the food may take a few,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he went to go check and came out with my food after another 10 mins cause he didn't know what happened,all you had to do was put cheese on chips omg how long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lots of mistakes while I was waiting 30 minutes from my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's good food ,This never distracted me from getting to the best fast food burrito in America though ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You're open til 2am and we have no food at 215am,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's Taco Bell food,I come here when I need food fast ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got home opened up the food kind of surprised,of the quality of the food, I didn't say anything until my son started complaining about his food,Especially my son he loves cheesy potatoes  burrito,I ordered my son cheesy potato grilled instead of his favorite because they don't make cheesy burrito now,He showed me that in the middle of his burrito is kind a thin,Seems like the price is going up,but the quality is lacking,,,,,,,,,,,,
also they are so inconsistent with the ingredients in the food,Some days I get a bean burrito with sour,They have options for non meat eaters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they try hard and as late night drunk food goes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They didn't wrap the tacos correctly,they used stale chicken to make the chicken flat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the food is pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bowl ,70 for a bag of chips and salsa that other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The customer service is always terrible and my food is always wrong,got home and had two crunchy tacos and one of the dollar burritos in both boxes,Not only was it NOT what I ordered the tacos were so old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Just when you think their ingredients cannot be combined another way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It takes about 20 from the time you order to the time you get your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst tacos I've ever got at any Taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the chipotle one,"I got a ""chickstar"" which is a crunchwrap with crunchy chicken", The new Mountain Dew citrus flavor was not to my taste- tasted diety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It's really good food that hits the spot,one Doritos Locos taco,a crunchy taco, I started with the crunchy taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got two crunchy tacos at the drive through,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nia was the best she took her time explained what was in the food made recommendations I brought a pie only because she said it was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a guy kept approaching the cars asking for money to get food,I offered to buy him some food,I guess he was planning on buying food other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food cost less than $3 total,I have gone to this taco bell my entire life (North PDX Native here) and tonight I waited 40 minutes for 2 bean burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get them no meat no nacho cheese add beans ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it's probably because I'm not ordering $30 worth of food one taco at a time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food however, I order the shredded chicken burrito for $2,59 and the triple melt burrito for $1,the $1 burrito had more in it than the chicken,could've made a better burrito from scraps out of their dumpster,The shredded chicken wss a joke,I opened it to put sauce inside and it was literally 3 shreds of chicken(that looked like hard, cheese),and cheese(basically all cheese,In reality I had a cheese rollup,The triple melt one was really mushy and not horrible taste wise,,,,,,,,,
I could have walked across the street and had chipotle make my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Go ahead and choose ANYTHING on the menu and tell me it's not delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ice cold food that should have been served hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Meximelts and Volcano hard shell tacos ROCK on a Friday night,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gave me another churro and some rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's close to Universal Studios and everyone is craving a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are out of ingredients x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waded through a sea of high-top tables & chairs to stand in line for 10 min (behind 2 people) and ordered my food at 6:57pm,"time--that's if you can classify this restaurant as ""fast"" food",the food is sub-st,"and the service is the slowest I've seen in years for ""fast"" food",Bypass this location and get better food ,and sloppy burrito supreme that came in my box,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Bean burrito made my stomach,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Other than that the food I received that day was good,I ordered the new naked chicken chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They also run out of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and as for the food theyre still good,i still enjoy munching on cheesy nachos and as for tacos i learned that if you are more specific,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll give two stars - one for friendly service and another for the food meeting expectations at a Colonel Sanchez (Taco Bell/ KFC Combo),I've tried the Frito Burrito and the shredded chicken quesadilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Crappy food (sad ,when you can't even live up to the Taco Bell stereotype of food),-Want your food specially made,-Beef is the equivilent of cat food,-The food here makes McDonalds look like 5-star,-For the price,chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it's worth it if they at least get your food right ,in your burrito,and then they added a little bit of shredded chicken,It's like they were making somebody else's order and then midway through tried to take out the meat and add in black beans for my order,But when you're vegetarian and don't want meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never had a problem with this taco bell before but today i got the cinnamon twists and they tasted like extremely strong,I've ordered the cinnamon twists at taco bell before and they have never tasted like this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
.food was like bleh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Perhaps it's because it was the first ""real"" food my mother fed me or perhaps because it was my first",and quality/portion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality is fast,food,I know you're so bad for me but you taste ohhhhh so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes you've just got to have some taco Bell ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered 6 chalupas supremes and 6 Doritos tacos supremes ,and they only put meat inside no sour,cream no lettuce no tomatoes I guess they think people like to pay extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and my food was called at 1231 - ,the food was made to good, quality - ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a dorito locos taco from here yesterday for the first,chalupa supreme or chicken quesideas with sour,time and it was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a crunch wrap supreme and they gave me an octagon shaped tortilla with just beans,Just beans,No meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then the food wasnt even edible,It was so bad and so many things were wrong with it that we just throw out the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't eat here unless you like turd tacos,it looked like liquid meat,I ordered 2 Doritos Locos Tacos and they both tasted like shit,I know they tasted like shit because I have eaten my own,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the Doritos tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A fresco taco--a hard,beans,lettuce ,corn tortilla shell,delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At any given time there are more people standing around waiting for their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I sped off after I gave him the money (without food) because I could tell he was more interested,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get your food fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was as good,as fast-food can be,this is a rating of a taco-bell as compared to other,taco-bells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How can making a taco take so long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food always tastes fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have the best tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place is average depending what they put in their meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They run out of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 15 minutes for a burrito (with no large,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you want food from here in the morning don't go here ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they only gave me half my food at the drive through,I ordered Doritos Locos Cheesy Gordita Cruches but I received regular Doritos Locos tacos,I ordered 4 rolled chicken Tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
waited a few minutes then was reapproached asking what was forgotten and had to wait AGAIN while they actually made the food,") The employees appeared to be annoyed that they had to ""remake"" my food with repeated non", I did not eat because of the tomato's on food that I didn't even order,Doritos taco ,crunchy taco , I only get the two tacos ,instead of a crunchy taco ,and Doritos taco I have a 2 crunchy taco supremes (with sour,instead of a and I have a 2 supremes (with sour cream ,AND always test your soda before you leave- it regularly taste AWFUL,,,,,,,,,,
For the first time when ordering food,After imputing all the food I wanted to order,not knowing how much time was needed from the time I pushed the app button to when I could get my food,When I got the food home the food was still hot,delicious Taco Bell food faster,different types of burritos,The 7-layer burrito was wrapped in a soft,multiple tacos,sour cream and a crunchy outer taco shell,The price would be $18,99 as compared to the individual price of 12 Crunchy Supreme Tacos for $20,chips ,and guacamole,tortilla and filled to overflowing with luscious guacamole,crunchy and delicious,,,,,
Late night drunk food,what's worse than coming home after a night of drinking only to discover that you got a fish taco instead of the quesadilla you ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is pretty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and food has been terrible,they take absolutely forever to get you your food because they are all busy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ended up eating an overpriced burger at Kelly's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is at least average for a Taco Bell ,but I routinely have to wait for 20+ minutes in a line of only a few cars to get my food,Suggestion: trek over to to Javier's tacos,and the prices are better than the one on Interstate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It was open faced with the meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is consistent,I got a burrito supreme ,and a taco supreme which with the diablo sauce was a perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the tacos are always broken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As far as food goes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is not superior, There are a lot places out there that charge more money and have worse quality of food,whether mexican food or otherwise, If you want absolutely best food,but it is good value for the price,but that brings us back to the price, You can't beat the prices at this place,the best thing to do is try reputable places that have higher prices, If you compare price versus quality for this place, The meat may be frozen,and not all of it is actual meat,but atleast the lettuce , quality,,,,,,,
the entire restaurant smells like a musty jock strap that was washed with farty refried beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 but the food is always hot, and tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They always run out of food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I assumed she was just ordering $60 worth of food,Then I sat at the window for nearly 10 minutes before I got my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fresh food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the food ,However today I walked in for my free Doritos locos tacos since they were having a promotion,So after standing their for about 45 seconds someone asked me what I'd like to order and I told them I'd like the free taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waiting an half an hour to get your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they always get the new food on time now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unhealthy food,Then another 8 mins to get the food once at the window,when they handed us the food it was already cold,it takes an average of 3 minutes to order and get your HOT food,Hard tacos soggy by the time we got home,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,The food took 15 minutes,I only gave it two stars because the food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is served hot,which is three tacos (either hard or soft,But for a reasonably priced meal,chicken s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Part 1: Cheesy potato burrito,The thing is a burrito,it's a burrito,It was a burrito without a tortilla - how that is possible,not a bowl,and just beans , The wrong cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expect to take 30 minutes or more to get your food,price is fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've waited for 35 minuets for my food here before ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just spent 25 minutes in the drive thru and when I got home my order was severely inaccurate chicken tacos,instead of steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then continued by shutting the window on our request for food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go to Tacobell for quick food,and me being a veteran at this location I can say the food ,If your food wasn't bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I come in there and they ask me to eat food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and of course I get home and the cheesy Gordita taco in my craving deal has literally no cheese,I ordered a soft taco instead of the hard,taco,and ofcourse I got a hard taco,The past few times my meals have either had missing ingredients or were cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They shorted us food that we paid for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is delicious, (tastes better than other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're never out of ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't know what fillers they are using in their Taco meat, It's worse than the worse meat because you just don't know what is in it,Spend 2 extra buck and go to Chiptole where meat is meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All I wanted was some tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was our second visit back through there as there as they completely ruined the food from our first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even when I sheepishly order a third waffle taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It takes some time for your food to come out,The Cinnabon bites are deliciousness wrapped in a ball of carb-ness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All my items were missing ingredients,I KNOW there are more ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
beef burrito supreme was perfect with some diablo sauce very spicy and my personal favorite fresco soft taco check it out they are operating on all cylinders good food,restaurant growing pains never bother me constant customer service was there at all times this visit i wanted to try the rolled chicken with the dipping sauces guacamole was better than expected also that spicy ranch was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
typical Taco Bell food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I watched the team member that took my order go back on the prep line with a new pair of gloves start working with food,take a finger load of food off the line ,then go back to touching more food without changing the gloves,in fear of what else could be wrong with the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This time put sc on it but forget to put the chicken on it,I said last time i came my salad had no sc on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Beware of price hikes,due to the fact that the franchisee has higher prices than any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They seem to have changed the quality of their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 But the food is consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food here isn't bad, I actually like the food here, Make sure when you order your food in the drive thru,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is typical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As I bit into my usual Double Decker taco,1 star knocked out because they didn't give me enough beans for my Double,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hot food,My wife orders tacos,Her tacos were cheese, fresco style because she doesn't eat cheese,Most Taco Bells manage to get pieces of cheese in it anyway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It also took forever to get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my burritos were stuffed ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,great price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered 2 soft tacos around 10:15 pm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I was here 23 min after they were open and they simply just said ""sorry we got in late an don't have any food ready",Just posting so perhaps the owners are aware of the quality of employees they posses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That said the food is generally fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Closing employees doesn't care about how the presentation of the food is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After ordering my food in the drive thru,a cheesy potato burrito,and one cheesy core burrito,the two burritos I bought weren't even the ones that I wanted,a crunchy taco,I realized that they completely forgot my quesarito and my crunch taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seems I'm not the only one who has gotten food poisoning from this location,but I continued to go due to liking the food,After my food poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is regular,a bean burrito ,If you have a craving for a #8 w/ soft tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's one dark haired girl with tattoos who will spend 20 seconds on her phone before she hands you your food,The food has gone down in quality since these workers started,cost the business owner less and result in faster/more reliable food delivery,Does anyone really want unhappy people in a hot kitchen making their food,Robots should be making these burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco Bell es una cadena de cómida fusión mexicana americana que se destaca por sus tacos pero también tiene otras opciones como burritos,Los nachos con queso no son ricos pero algunos de los tacos,del plato que comi (una degustacion de 3 tacos) estaban ricos,Hay salsas picantes para,salsa y lechuga,sándwiches y ensaladas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is sub,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've worked in the food business,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She was also very rude and as we ate our food she was cursing ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and if they somehow managed to get the right order the food isn't made correctly like a chicken burrito WITHOUT CHICKEN,The people working here ALWAYS mess up on orders like if you paid for a $5 burrito somehow you get a 1 dollar taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but when I asked for a chunky chicken ,instead of the shredded chicken (reminds me of tuna salad - yech),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The wait for the food was 21 minutes ,The food I received was over cooked,over cooked food,other than the 500 pound cholo leaning on the counter demanding a free taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not  sure wen I'll be make because  not one time she even offered  to comp me something  for the bad food they gave me last,I went to the drive thru  last night an got four nacho cheese grillers extra meat,So the guy at the window  say the cook misread  the screen  didn't  see the extra meat so I put four sides of beef on the side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You know I understand it's the night shift but If it takes a half hour to get some food then you need a new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best fastfood establishment I've ever been in,and you get your food fast,and the tacos actually look like they're supposed too,always fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For two bean burritos , The beans were tepid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cons: The drive thru food could have been warmer,I tried the breakfast burrito for the first,The line for this place gets so long and it must be due to the service and quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today had the strawberry starburst freeze and it is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not a bad place to satisfy your urge for junk food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lady in front of me wanted a bucket of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She didn't treat me like someone who just came in to get food,I was craving the Doritos tacos after watching one of my favorite,I ordered my three Doritos tacos which came out in less than 5 minutes (expected because it's a fast,The tacos were okay,"Out of all three I recommend the ""cooler ranch Doritos"" taco","you will love their newest Doritos taco ""fiery Doritos""",the shells were a little soggy but maybe that's because of the lettuce inside,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you open your food ,I'm vegetarian so I ask for my beef to be replaced by black beans every time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the Pepsi looked light-skinned and tasted horrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food is better than I remembered it,Ever since discovering the excellent tacos at King Burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a beef burrito supreme ,and a steak quesadilla as well as a Mountain Dew Baja blast freeze none of my order was correct or well-done and even after I voiced concern that the drink wasn't the right consistency the employee still gave it to me there was no steak inside of my burrito ,and sparse steak in my overcooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is cheap,I really hope they can get it together because I'm really tired of paying for food I'm not receiving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once my food arrived,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I left without my taco assuming they are just as lazy with food prep ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Use to be bad food,I like the prices,the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Very little meat on my taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service is super friendly and the food is consistently good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got food poisoning from you twice ,you should probably check your food before you serve it,and found nasty thick hair in my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered bean burritos which came with about 2 tablespoons of beans ,and the barest hint of cheese,One we ordered with lettuce ,You pay extra for 5 thin strings of lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Normally go inside at this location as i learned to ALWAYS check the food before leaving,Opened first chalupa and it was pretty much meatless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is why this location gets two stars instead of one - simply because Taco Bell is beautiful and wonderful and tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of food is pretty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was almost frozen,if you want cold food then this is got to be the first,i asked for 3 quesadillas and 2 doritos locos tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I moved to SW now but still would come to this one for late night fixes because the Taco Bells out here suck like the beans will be jacked up ,and the soda mix messed up and bad meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I only ever eat tacos,mexican pizza and chips ,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for giving me food at 3am,You are my favorite trash food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finally got our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so bad I choked on my taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have gone here a couple of times and every time we do they are friendly and they give us our tacos or quesadillas in under 2-3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89 taco that was made wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They once made me a burrito with a small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She gets the steak chalupa supreme I usually get a crunchy taco recently replaced by volcano tacos which kick ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this place is the worst taco bell in the city rude a$$ employees ghetto dont care about customers snatches money acts like they cant hear ur order threw the drive thru cant speak clear english not understandable dirty place to go eat no respect for people would never recomend here cold chicken this should be shut dont,with all these bad reviews should become a popeyes or some other chicken place,the meat is always funie, tasten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and made fresh food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came here yesterday inside and there were 6 people waiting for food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I finally told her to give me a discount for my food because she also said that she needed to close down the store due,and 2 5 layer burritos,I ordered a steak quesadilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only thing right about the meal was the taco,The rancid aftertaste still persists,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I've tried to go there a quarter past 7 a few times as I'm in a hurry to get to work and they have never been ""ready"" to cook food",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Still waiting for my two tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
)  not only did we wait for 25 minutes for our food ,Once again my family and I spent 30 dollars on food ,and I'm hungry because my food is always messed up,A missed burrito,taco etc,but the beans were burnt ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
late night run to taco bell for a burrito turns into a shouting match with ciara an employee for taco bell what type of business allows cursing at customers ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food looked exactly as it does in the commercials,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well this is yet another cookie cutter location of tex mex food,It is cheap and tastes better than most other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My Doritos nacho tacos are crispy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The help was lazy and I was told they had no idea about the 4 tacos for $5 special,We went through the drive thru and paid $21 for tacos with no filling,We got soggy taco shells with some lettuce ,and some with no meat filling-others with less than 1 teaspoon of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- soft taco supreme add onion ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only does it take 30+ minutes to get your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You probably know the food is simple,Only 3 stars just because it's fast-food-quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-Tasty food at reasonable,prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then when I actually get my food ,Now to the food, I will defend TB's deliciousness until I die,Just as delicious as any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burnt food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he said the beef quesadilla was marked so I took a fat bite and it was my friends chicken quesadilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The woman on the speaker was so friendly and helpful and happily answered my silly questions about whether I could get light sour cream and if she thought I could finish 3 tacos in the combo,The tacos were just fair-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Anyone want to work on class action suit against this place for how many times you've paid for food you didn't receive, I stopped by Monday evening and they didn't give me two sides of rice in my drive thru order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I catch this Taco Bell on my way home from work always around dinner time--the food is normally pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My biggest reason for giving this location 5 stars is that the food is always fresh,You can go to some locations and get a bean burrito ,and tell that the beans have been sitting for awhile because they are dry,The beans are always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Some of the newer locations could serve any food, There is NO mistaking that this place serves tacos,and cheese,sour cream,Once you were out of sour cream, Sometimes I wish I had a sour cream gun installed at my house,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looked like they smushed it and threw it in whatever they used to heat it up and it smelled like the cheese was old,Took one bite and it tasted biter ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tell them you want extra cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was well prepared,The tacos and burritos had plenty of filling ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice,and chicken,I have gone around 1130 at night and they are out of beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's Taco Bell food is ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I even paid extra for some upgrades on tacos just to receive a regular,ole taco like I didn't just pay extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is usually good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Honestly I think the food is delicious,just wish it was faster to receive your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when I opened my wrap there was no meat inside,they gave me another one with meat ,but this time no lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
under cooked food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always hot, and tastes as I would expect compared to other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered (drive thru) a simple number 8 which is just 3 soft tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food pretty much all st,food came out quite quickly, There seem to be some $1 breakfast burrito with egg ,Been forever since I ate taco Bell, Give it a shot if you never been to a taco Bell before,and meat inside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 But I get my food anyways, I get my food,and I really like the taste of the food,""" I think to myself ""the extra Baja sauce on my crispy potato soft taco will be the judge",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Will go back soon to try them in a burrito or loaded nachos, They have some type of zesty seasoning on them and go perfectly with the cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  This keeps the prices in line vs the franchise operations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At least the food is what you'd expect from Taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's not a preference it's a requirement that my food doesn't have dairy in it,The overall quality of the food is not worth,They clearly don't take pride in their food or customer service,Which we complicated simply because they have Fresca tacos already on the menu,We ordered a few Fresca tacos ,it is a taco without cheese,We get to the window and the tacos are smothered in cheese,We get them changed and the crunchy taco shells are soggy,not even consider a taco at this point,Not only did I have to get my tacos remade ,but then my tacos are broken ,We live right around the corner for this location in which is very convenient,,,,,,,,
Walked in to grab a quick taco or three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their hard and softshell tacos are comparable,then a distinct layer of cold lettuce and cheese on the top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food didn't even taste like Taco Bell, It's tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once again the food is filling ,The lobby was filled with customers waiting on their food,Some had to take it to go due to The long lined and one customer seemed ready to go home without their food,If you have never eaten at a taco bell it serves basically tex mex style food,And occasionally a star like the caramel apple empanadas or the smothered burritos,But they have taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Steak burrito was a joke for the amount of ""steak"" that was on it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes they can be a little on the slow side getting food out ,Sometimes the food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't expect the food to be 5 stars ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hoping that maybe someone from corporate would show them how to properly make their food, I ordered up a bunch of the spicy chicken burritos, They hadn't cooked the rice in the burritos,my friends and I decided to give into the late night fast food taco craving,and some soft tacos, Go to Wendy's around the corner instead if you're looking to satisfy that bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always a good place for authentic white people Mexican food,would sacrifice the innocence of my beautiful brown eye for a box of tacos agai,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food seems to be fresh,Cant wait for the new Doritos Flavor tacos to come out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Remember when Taco Bell used to have those timers (which is still installed at this location) and if it too long to get your food it was free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Took awhile for the food to be ready,but the food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered food for me ,But the positive side of all of this is whoever ordered this food really spent some money ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wouldn't know how the food is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would have gone somewhere 'nicer' to pick up food for them ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10+ minutes to get food in the drive through every single,Food quality is what you'd expect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a chicken burrito earlier,Tonight and last time they didn't grill my mini grilled chicken quesadilla,cheese wasn't melted,""" tasted",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But if you have 20 - 30 minutes to wait for your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Currently in on the Keto diet and opted for their steak power bowl no rice no beans,extra cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a Mexican Pizza and I got a meatless pizza,only to get AGAIN a meatless Mexican,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What even pathetic is that they charge you a $2 fee when ordering on line for delivery and their prices go up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spent literally 40 minutes in the drive though just to get 3 soft shell (beef and cheese only) tacos,And my tacos were awful,How do you mess up only meat ,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and always has 12 cars wrapped around the building with 5 people waiting dor food ,Place is ALWAYS out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please teach your staff how to prepare the food,Sloppy food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One star because I just ate three tacos from the drive though ,and now I smell like a taco,Another star because I couldn't understand a word that was said over the speaker but I still got tacos,and I smell like a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They jacked up my order and the food was under cooked,Poorly ran even for a taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
take an hour long to get my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not to mention the lady on the cashier messed my order up adding a Doritos locos tacos as well as my friends order,and considering the fact that I only order 2 chicken chaloopas ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My problem is with the food,When I say that the food at Taco Bell is bad,I head on over to the closest Taco Bell for an inexpensive dose of mystery meat,loaded with cheese ,My Cheesy Roll-Up had zero cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all for nothing when I should have had just go get the food mysel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I overheard the cashier telling one of them it would be 10 minutes for the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(again) we had to repeat our order more than 3 times so she could understand how we wanted our food ,When we arrived home food was also cold,We went on Sunday and after waiting to be assisted they told us they had no chicken,no steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I only got a fry and two soft tacos supremes ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Half-full cheese sauce on the reg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
waited almost 50 minutes for our food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Employees are rude and I can't figure out why there is routinely a 10-15 minute wait for tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I walked in to this newly opened Taco Bell excited and full of anticipation for a great taco experience,Unfortunately this feeling of bliss caused me to overlook the facial expressions of several unhappy customers still waiting for their tacos,Unfortunately my high hopes were quickly dashed by the worst taco experience I have ever had,several fights almost broke out and I feared for the safety of the tacos makers as well as my own,"One man shouted with a crazy look in his eye "" hey buddy where's my expletive taco I'm Fin",However I persisted and received my Gordita crunch taco close to an hour after ordering it,Will say the taco was warm,As I walked in the aromas of ground beef hot sauces and melted cheese overpowered my mind,,,,,,,,,,,,
but if I roll up at 3:47pm on a Friday afternoon and am told it's going to be 30 minutes to get two tacos I can make in a minute ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is about how long it usually gets my food regardless of whether I order it online or in person,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the only things I've ever ordered since I was a little girl were a 7 layer burrito ,So instead I asked for a 5 layer burrito with a side of fire sauce,the burrito I received was only meat ,and cheese & mild,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yet when I stopped my food was literally the best Taco Bell I've ever had,the burritos were full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Found a bug in my taco ,and reported it to a manager named Christina she simply looked at my taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my food at the drive thru,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Took forever getting our food,We finally get our food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place never gets my food right,I had to go back around for my extra condiments that they charged me for because they forgot it and when I got home all of my food was wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I got home and started eating my burrito a found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is typical,Other places on I drive will drive up the price because it is in a tourist area,but this place keep price the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and when we first asked if we could order another item she said we didn't have to pull through but then gave us our food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or just the quality of employees they hire (or LACK of quality should I say),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pre covod review: I had the opposite experience of my friend Nancy H below -- I ordered on the mobile app (T Mobile Tuesdays gives you free burritos once a week) ,but I was there at 1:03 and my burrito was sitting there for my 1:00 order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The kid at the window has EXTEME eczema and was scratching at his skin the whole time we were waiting for our food,but it made me lose my appetite knowing he was scratching at himself and then handing our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Fast food"" my bum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I ordered my two burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the quality of the product,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was poorly made,It took a full hour for four tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We then ordered a side of cheese and didn't get it until 30 minutes after and all the food was cold,This is the worst service you will ever receive and the food was disgusting,the soft tacos were hard,Someone ordered one taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
roughly handed me the bag of food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
) The sole reason being because of how terrible the quality of food is at this restaurant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then waited for food for more than an hour,They weren't short on food or staff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is difficult to enjoy your food ,The food was good,Taco Bell is a great value for the food you get,My friend got the new $1 grand burrito: loaded taco for the first,He really enjoyed the red tortilla strips in the burrito along with the beef & cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Sorry though you not only gave us a taco salad which we did t order you missed three other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 great tacos ,  I'd definitely go back when I have craving for tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast food is supposed to be fast,then waited another 10+ minutes for 3 regular tacos ,and 2 rolled shocked tacos,He said he told them 5 times he's vegetarian and can't have meat ,and not to put any meat in his order,I think it's great that a vegetarian accidentally got meat in his mouth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The higher disappointment was the fact that the manager didn't even care to improve the quality of the food ,when given the opportunity and treated the experience as a guest just wanting free food,I told her I no longer had the receipt but did take timestamped photos on the day of so (since I was pressed for time and could not say something that visit) she could see the lack of any meat in any of the items,Went and ordered a few different items only to find more sour cream ,and lettuce than anything,""" I took her up on the offer to remake part of the order and had told her I could show her timestamped photos for evidence if it could help with quality control",Upon arrival we did as followed and asked the person at the window if the manager whom I had spoken with wanted to see the photos for quality control moving forward,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I called corporate and they had a different store employee from this location call me after hours on his personal phone to call me a liar and tell me there is no way the food could possibly have mold,on it because he orders the food personally ,I ordered nachos at this location and when I opened it there was mold on a couple chips so I took it back ,He said it looks like fryer grease splashed onto the chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Services was literally trash they were very rude to me and threw my food in the bag sloppy,I made a donation and one of the employees (white kid) said i can't get my free taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And they give free food to their friends,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I attached a picture of my receipt and one of the three burritos opened with no sour,I was however charged for my sour cream,All three were missing the additional ordered ingredient,It appears that when you tell Taco Bell your order is to go their quality control goes out the window,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Not Mexican food,It was only about one minute between order time and my food being done,taco meat (, I happened to be in the mood for something that takes nacho cheese,lettuce and sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
two of which I've left without food after waiting almost an hour (even ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today my chicken burrito was 90% rice,If I wanted a rice burrito I could've just made that crap at home,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shredded chicken and chipotle three cheese,creamy chipotle sauce,Spicy Tostada doesn't even sound like shredded chicken mini quesadilla,A tostada features refried beans,shredded cheddar cheese,shredded lettuce,and frankly tasted like leftovers,,,,,,,,,,,,,
last time I had Taco Bell was like 10 years ago back when you could order 10 tacos for 10 dollars,Burger King has a 10 dollar deal for 10 tacos,The prices aren't as cheap,now I can finally taste Baja Blast again ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the lines moves quickly and you can watch your food being made,Now getting to the food,and was accommodating to my friends request to make as close to a double decker taco ,and there was plenty of meat,The cheese was cool,lettuce crisp,it was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered almost $30 worth of food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The taco meat looked a week old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered 3 crispy tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't go here)It's disgusting and dirty I went here because I never had it and I threw up and got food poisoning I had to go to the hospital ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spent $25 for slow cold food,Poor quality customer service poor quality food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I was always a huge fan of the bean burritos, The bean burrito was like some mashed,lukewarm beans in a tortila,cheese ,No cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is hot,I was standing to the side waiting for my food ,"looked in the bag and yelled back to the kitchen ""whose food is this",Like she was giving me food that I didn't order,The food's alway's good,This time I went because I read they were giving away a free taco to every customer this afternoon,"I felt awkward saying ""I want the free taco""",so i ordered my cheesy gordita crunch and figured they would put the free taco in automatically,I decided I better tell the cashier about the free taco,"She asked me what my order was again and I told her a cheesy gordita crunch she said ""That's not free but I can ring you up for a free regular taco""",So I keep waiting for the taco,I told her that it had been sitting there since before I ordered my taco so it's not mine,But I honestly think she was confused by what was happening and said I should take the taco,,,,,,,
I wanted that free bean burrito from taco bell if you order from the mobile,Taco Bell makes a dope bean burrito to satiate the hunger ,I saw the lady scroll through all her orders at the taco making counter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A) rolled up in a hurry for food,The bean and rice $1 burrito is basically keeping me afloat through all of this,There are two things I expect when I go for a late night T-Bell run: (1) that delicious Tex mex flavor we've grown to love ,They appeared to have a great time making these delicious items ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It gets a second star because the food was terrific,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited 20 minutes for threetacos on a slow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm hungry and i was looking to here for food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
took 22 minutes from the time I paid until we got all our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our tacos had no meat just packed with lettuce ,and sour cream,if I wanted a salad I wouldn't be going to Taco Bell for one just saying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only is the food orders incorrect,It's just your standard taco and burrito chain restaurant,with all my meat ,and cheese in the two middle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just wanted the right food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also asked for extra sauce and when i got home they gave 0 But the food was good,They also gave a extra taco lo, the lettuce was crispy not soggy like some other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
beef soft taco,no cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I see maybe 2 or 3 cars pull up and leave without any food,Taco Bell - I love your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I think as a baby boomer I will just use my money to pay for another millennial on Favor to wait for this millennial to serve them and they can bring me my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they charged me for the sour cream i ordered,missing two sour creams,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As a back up I went with the chicken quesadilla ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which is why I felt bad having to go return it after they didn't make my food fresco,Please be careful to check your food if you have severe,Expecting the Fritos burrito,Open up one and it's missing the guacamole I paid for -- sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the mood for stale taco shells ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Update we went back - same evening-  and AmaZing assistant manager Antoine ( if we are spelling that or saying that right he said it so quickly ) said that our next meal was 'on him' and he fixed it by giving us our two tacos and a remade beef and cheese burrito with those little,We have watched the quality of worker go Down here quickly and now we are missing a taco each for each of our meals ,cheese with small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do not go inside or you will wait a long time for your food,I used the little kiosk to order my food,"I said ""excuse me I'd like your general managers name"" probably 10 times at the top of my lungs before the girl making tacos walked over ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was definitely above,the bean burrito (which was made perfectly fresco,and for full disclosure I'm reviewing this TB in comparison to NYC TB which is such a disaster for a much higher price - ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" Then the tacos weren't wrapped well ",but three of 5 tacos were mostly shell before they were out of the bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast food establishment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when adjusting my order at the window by requesting ""NO ONIONS"" on our burritos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They took it back and gave us our food,burrito supreme,And my burrito supreme was sad,supreme tacos,taco salad,Our tacos were already soggy by the time we got there ,I don't know what the difference was because it's basically all the same ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,
People were complaining about wrong food or the long,Then the food was wrong,I literally counted to ten while watching one guy wrapping up a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fine,everything that falls out on the table should be considered a sacrifice to the food gods,Chalupa Supreme with steak was fine,What was a pleasant surprise was the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By far the worst taco Bell around,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7 minutes tops and food is out threw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My regular tacos were stale,I go to this location a lot and usually Everytime i ask for extra meat I usually get it,I got charged for extra meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Terrible service and terrible food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seen one bag of food go out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you're looking for a quick bite with a lot of sass and no sense of customer service or quality ""bush league"" for a stoners appetite with watered down my dew",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went to pick up this beautiful looking taco,and to my surprise the WHOLE bottom of the taco fell through,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We order our food same,the car in front of us is in the middle of getting their food ,and it is visibly clear that the order he received was wrong and about 10 minutes later he didn't receive his food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I still really enjoy there food,Sometimes they burn my crunch wraps and the tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love their steak chalupas with lots of fire sauc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their customer service isn't that great and they get sloppy with their burritos past 5pm:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I finally got to order my food,and then waited another glorious 10 minutes for my food,Cool beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the burritos,my family's tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
add shredded chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is below,go down the road to Chipotle for an all around better experience and food,If you're looking for a taco or something along the lines of Taco Bell items,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not too long ago I went to the drive thru I had a somewhat big order and I don't live that far from it maybe 8 mins to get home but all the food was  literally cold,I rather drink bleach than  go to this Taco Bell location they always messed up my order and one time the meat was not fully cooked it was still a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also forgot some of the sauces on my burritos,I got a chicken quesadilla too ,and they used the wrong type of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"one of the items was missing their ""meat""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When we finally did get our food,I know what I'm getting food wise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go home open my meal and there's always beans on the food ,I always request no beans,or I request for no beans specially ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was fast,She from the classic Doritos locos tacos to the new,and quality service at any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He then proceeded to pull up his pants with his gloved hand & continue to prepare food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AND food came out incredibly fast ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is sloppy,often are missing ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the wait for food was long to the point where some people just got up ,One of the staff members stepped out the the food prep,area and began closing and locking the doors and went back to handle and prep food with the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we get our food with no apology or acknowledgement,And the odds are not worth it for subpar pseudo Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" Waited another 35 minutes for our food",""" Cashier came over and both of them retook our order and got it wrong bit were adamant that it was right even though we showed the price difference between it ",we ordered one crunch wrap meal and one chalupa cravings box and a chicken quesadilla at 7:55 on the kiosk ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited while 5 other customers before got their food,What this bag and food looks like it what the inside of this establishments walls ,I personally didn't see them drop my food on the ground ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I cant put my finger though on why the food turnaround times so high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is a welcome addition to food options,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of the food is not even good,but what really bothered me the most is they made us wait for more than usual and in the end served us a soggy bag that contained what looked like yesterday's taco inside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they gave me a free cinnamon twist but then this rude worker tossed my food on the counter,I had to tell her not to throw my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I tried to order a bean & cheese burrito w/ xtra cheese (order this about monthly,"Him: ""we don't have a normal bean & cheese burrito""","Me: ""I want a bean & cheese burrito with the normal",We just have a bean burrito,"not a bean & cheese burrito""","Him: ""so just beans ","and cheese""","Me: ""normal + xtra cheese"""," red sauce & onions but w/ xtra cheese""",,,,,,,,,,,
I have been here multiple times at this hour and have gotten my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
taco was horrible and burrito was so bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My go to is a beef 5 layer burrito (with no sour,the crunch of the taco shell really floats my boat, cream of course ) Another amazing cuisine selection is the diritos locos tacos (my favorite is cool,the crisp juicy taste of the mountain dew baja blast gets me every time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After 10 minutes someone finally came to the door and told me ""we don't have any food"" ",I asked when I can get my food ,About 40 minutes later I get a text that my food is ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when I got to the register to pay for my food they messed up all my order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They call it fast-food for a reason ,There were 5 people in the food prep,I saw people put an order in before me and they still didn't get their food by the time I got mine,The layout is obnoxious there's no room to wait for your order / in line since the food prep station is awkwardly in front of the store,Not to mention my tacos were soggy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Did I think it was going to be real Mexican food,Shredded Chicken Quesadilla Melt- Probably my favorite of the food items,Definitely the smallest burrito I ever had ,The entire bottom stuck to the paper and stayed there when I removed the taco,but a good value for the price,a lot of hard pieces of rice in there,Not a ton of flavor and pretty skimpy with the chicken,not at all so I wasn't too disappointed with the taste,Didn't taste like Doritos to me,,,,,,,,,,,
And they always run out of chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You will be waiting 30 mins for food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do not go inside or you will wait a long time for your food,I used the little kiosk to order my food,"I said ""excuse me I'd like your general managers name"" probably 10 times at the top of my lungs before the girl making tacos walked over ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I just got the best slushy of my life I ordered altogether way too much food from this Taco Bell location both of the people working inside were super,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First order the chalupa box and the second order is the 2 chicken chalupa meal I asked her to change the chicken to beef I'm pregnant,and I can't eat chicken well I repeated my order 3 times ,and she tells me that on the screen it shows chicken ,So I pulled up and my first mistake was not actually checking the chalupas got home and it was all chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well anyways I got my food,"got home and idk if they were running out of food or what because my ""power bowl"" was mostly lettuce",Worst service and food,I am not exaggerating when I say there was maybe 2 tablespoons of beans and 3 of rice in this bowl,Then my crunch wrap was just a smear of black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was hot,This is one of best Taco Bell in Columbus as far as the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is placed into a plastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't need an after school  program spitting in my food ,there's mcDs and  Arby's around the corner who don't hire assholes like her,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff has been very kind and attentive to any needs or mistakes in food,my food has always been made to how I need it,Never had any problems with my food or major,I like extra red sauce on my bean burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had my two fresco bean burritos & one fresco seven layer burrito (for a gr,this location has yet to include meat or dairy in any of my vegan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was sub,The taco shell was broken,my Crunchwrap had very very very little meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered 4 crunchy tacos ,The taco shells were all cracked,Upon eating we found rotted lettuce in the tacos ,and very little meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I believe this location is actually passing off garbage as food,About once per year I make a poor decision to grab food from this dump,Either the staff there doesn't know how to make food correctly,Still scratching my head at how a burrito could be that cold,It's like they took the sour cream out of the freezer and added it to the burrito,like an ingredient had turned,and it tasted tinny,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is adequate,they make a great steak quesarito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And then they didn't give me the correct food--I ordered a beef quesadilla ,and they gave me a bean burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered extra chicken ,The chicken was moist ,and cheese with my Chipotle Chicken Melts,and the cheese was melted well,That being said the quality was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Still - for a fast food establishment - the food wasn't prepared,That being said - the tacos were all made properly ,and had the familiar Taco Bell taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After waiting 45 minutes for one taco I was gifted a ""free",taco of your choice,""" A few weeks later I went in to redeem my coupon and was told I am unable to use it on anything but a hard taco",Safe to say as much as I enjoy Taco Bell I will not be returning to this location but I hope the homeless person I gifted my free taco to enjoys it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We just wanted 10 soft tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i set down the food ,even if it's a half hour away i guarantee you you will get your food faster,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
subbed meat with beans),They even asked if I wanted black or their regular beans,I usually get Taco Bell when traveling and many have a hard time with my order and still put cheese on it or forget to sub beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came to the counter to show my food,no chicken,and to ask about chicken,98 for mostly lettuce on a pita,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ate here in 2006 and got such bad food poisoning from this restaurant i ended up hospitalized,I haven't had any taco bell since having food at this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's bread and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of the food is not even good,but what really bothered me the most is they made us wait for more than usual and in the end served us a soggy bag that contained what looked like yesterday's taco inside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you have clusters of people waiting for their food,The woman who I'm guessing was the manager was helping the other two folks get the food ready,but it was pretty clear she just did NOT give a crap that they were crawling through food orders,they put sour cream in my 5-layer beef burrito after I very politely ,they forgot the crunchy taco that accompanies the quesadilla meal ,and clearly asked the cashier to please omit the sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm sitting in it right now waiting on food ,The workers are lazy and are standing around joking when there's 20+ people waiting on food,they have a machine spilling water and other fluids all over the food prep are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got my food after about 20 minutes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a beef burrito supreme without sour,cream and a steak burrito,Even though our slip said we ordered a burrito supreme without sour,We only ordered six crunchy tacos,We got six semi crunchy tacos,something that resembled cheese whiz ,whatever we received had sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks for the delicious food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I guess if you guys would actually stay open until 11 your crappy food would be worth it,One time I actually was in line at 10:45 ( 15 min before closing) and the guy said by the time my food would be ready,I'll save the poor food quality for another day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wanted to try the grilled cheese burrito because I heard that it was good,I ordered the grilled cheese burrito & taco,  I noticed the line item price for the burrito on the drive thru screen was different,39 for the grilled cheese burrito,39 for the grilled cheese burrito instead of taking the $,However I do want to let you know that the grilled cheese burrito was surprisingly on the spicy side , There was not an overwhelming amount of cheese,I guess I was expecting more cheese like a grilled,cheese s,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not ""fast"" food by any means",Get the steak one if you are wanting to try one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who makes Supreme tacos without sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took over 40 minutes to get food,there is no reason why it would take this long for food to come out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There food is so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my son describes them as fries covered in Mexican spices with a nacho cheese dipping sauce,It's so corny ,They're either hit or miss with the quality of cinnamon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With as many food options as are available,and no utensils were provided for either cantina bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food from any Taco Bell location is pretty much, The food is always OK,it's on a corner that has a traffic light with left,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The manager then ask for the mistake tacos back cool,Not only was is snatched out my hand the new taco was thrown on the counter by the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Go to taco C instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is 1 person doing the dine in food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UPDATE: after 10 more minutes they came back out and asked what food we wanted ,and then proceeded to make food for an employeee ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While it's far from my favorite Mexican food option in Portland,I've ordered the fresco (no dairy) bean burrito as well as the fresco crunchwrap supreme (with beans instead of beef) & had no issues with incorrect,the price, orders or consistency in terms of the taste & size of my meals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I ordered a number 1 which says taco supreme,and shows 3 pictures of 3 supreme tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got my food,and even had time to gossip around before they returned with their food,The doritos los tacos aren't that great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is fast food quality food,But at least the food was hot,They didn't give enough guacamole ,and cheese dip (containers were only half-full, and tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got ignored by all workers til finally this emo chick comes up doesn't say anything and just stands there lookin like I shouldn't even be there just a bunch of rude ass kids working and fuckin off which  I can get to an extent being young and working with friends but damn don't come up to me and stare at me like your gonna steal my soul all I wanted was a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food served there ,doesn't taste the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didn't know it was possibly to mess up food this badly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's them tripping up on an ingredient you explicitly asked to be left out and hearing workers joke about spitting in your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I did finally get my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Headed to my neighborhood and wanted some food,because I am trying to eat your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I often order tacos for later or tacos for friends whereas,The price is kinda,I always order chicken quesadillas because of the sauce they put in (I have the recipe for their sauce ,But those new Verde green sauce packets are delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Although the food has always been good,Good customer service plus good prices plus good food will get my money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's another one of my dirty food secrets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They always tell you to do their surveys online as if they're giving out quality food,"they didn't even try to put the cheese & beans in the middle just on one side of the ""nachos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
money and food given back in the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typical Taco Bell food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At least if the food is slow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is telling her coworkers to make the darn food ,I finally got my food ,the food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at least she's not actually working with the food,Mom got a soft taco,Not what you want in your taco,I asked when was wrong & she said there was ice in the lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went to chipotle and food was better ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but forgot to bag my burrito I ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I choose another loaded potato griller and a spicy potato soft taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got some surprise meat in one of my shredded chicken burritos this time ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but over 20 minutes to get a quesadilla and taco is insane,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had to wait additional time for the food to be ready,when it comes to food orders at fast food places,however it clearly wasn't the new burrito,didn't have the red chips inside ,because it didn't have the melted cheese on the top,with no sour cream,and it HAD sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Taco Bell consistently has the best service and freshest and most generous food of any Taco Bell I have been too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and to top it off wrong food excuses for why they were that way the only,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered food through door dash cause my wife was craving some tacos,Not like I used to work in the food industry before or anything,Ran a restaurant and food service 101,We ordered soft tacos with beans,and we got taco meat,Bit into the taco ,Not sure what it was but they're definitely something that doesn't belong in a taco,it looked like they gave us crumbs and meat,and of course she said she checked the quality of her meat ,and it tasted off,,,,,,,,,,
A person gave me my food so they all must be hiding in the back,My food didn't take all that long as mentioned in other,There was zero atmosphere but always serving five star food,And it tasted true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually order fresco bean burritos,&/or dairy-free seven-layer burritos,meat & dairy-free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wanted and needed food for both me ,and my boyfriend and there was not even another food for me,00 and I was like where is all the food at,she kept saying burrito I had to repeat myself at least 3 times,I said gordita and she said burrito I ended up getting all small,I order a couple of tacos ,and a Gordita and a bucket of chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll update this review when I get my food,Edit: exited drive thru with food at 11:04pm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Drive through was quick and food tasted fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went to get breakfast for a group of friends as I was ordering the gentleman made rude comments about the amount of food I was ordering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm sitting in it right now waiting on food ,The workers are lazy and are standing around joking when there's 20+ people waiting on food,they have a machine spilling water and other fluids all over the food prep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food sub par 9 people working yet bathroom is disgusting with pubes on the seat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I mean the service is pretty slow the parking lot legit has about 6 cars waiting for food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At least they turned on the outside lights by the time we got our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fast on the food prep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food that I ordered was not lukewarm,It had been sitting for so long the food had become stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 But the problem isn't in the quality of the food,which she sighs heavily and I fear she'll spit in my food,last time my grilled stuffed burrito ,WORST taco Bell location,I am done going to this taco Bell ,Today it was my chicken chalupa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had one of the best steak quesadillas I've ever had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Barely put any beans or lettuce on my tostada ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you can't commit to your poster opening time and can't make menu items (not due to lack of food),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Go to a different location or try a different food chain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered crunchy taco supreme (no lettuce,I'm guessing these tacos are mostly lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the customer in front of me ordered two breakfast burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which included 2 pieces of chicken,there was only one chicken wing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always i like  taco  bell  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is this human food or dog food,Is it a taco or a piece of cardboard,Is that shredded cheese or plastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was charged for a party pack of 12 soft beef taco supreme ,I got 12 regular beef tacos ,and 1 chicken taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Not only do they get the order wrong the food is always cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is bl,got beans instead of beef ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When they gave us what they missed in our order the food was falling apart it wasn't even eatable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got to window and after getting my food,Soni switched my order and got nacho bell grande with extra extra cheese,Got regular cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ordering 8 breakfast burritos for his crew,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The second is that while their food turnaround is super,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Almost 40 minutes to get our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I get better food ,this is slow and it's not gourmet food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Be aware when visiting this Franchise that they do not use corporate prices,If you're looking for value prices then do not goto this establishment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food was cold I had a chicken bacon chulupa really it was literally 2 pieces of chicken in my taco it was full, of sour cream,and taste like CRAP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Felt like I burned through $12 of food that didn't hit the spo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was not assembled well (by normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I hate throwing food out , 20% of the time is too high to be throwing improperly made food away, Part of what it means is no Baja Sauce and no cheese, The cheese I can check quickly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get home to find I didn't get a chicken burrito I paid for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50% of the time the food is good,other 50% it's sloppy or just tastes bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food was smashed into pieces and tacos were missing ingredients,Terrible quality control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While the food is of questionable,quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At one time you could go to Taco Bell and get solid food, I made the mistake of trying to order a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It doesn't matter how many times you tell them What you want in your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service was terribly slow and I definitely got food poisoning from here,The food I got seemed incredibly old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the almost-beef taco, 12-pack taco boxes don't eat themselves,"and features the new ""Cantina Bell"" menu which seems to have taken a chunk out of Chipotle's stock price recently",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food,The intrigue is over along with your Doritos tacos,and mystery meat at 11pm,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 On average you will wait 5-10 minutes for the most basic of orders and when you do get your food, Broken shells on taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Definatly the BEST Taco Bell I have ever had (only used the drive through) the service is always awesome and the food is yummy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 If you ask for light lettuce on your taco they seem to think it means you want extra, if they manage to actually give you light lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is usually quick,I love inexpensive tacos  & it's essentially the closest food from the house,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so after waiting 15+ minutes for your food 95% of the time it is terribly terribly wrong,I ordered a bean and cheese burrito,And somehow ended up with a chipotle ranch and nacho cheese burrito,and again bean and cheese was somehow translated to rice,spicy ranch and nacho cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been sitting here for food for about 30 minutes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I rank the food somewhere above KFC & slightly below eating a cat lump out of the litter box,it was common knowledge that the employees spit & did other less than desirable things in the various meats & sauces,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Great late night food anytime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but beefy five layer burritos do get the job done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My second time going here because they ran out of ground beef they piled on a lot of lettuce and very little meat I will not eat from Taco Bell in M AN OR Texas anymor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the popcorn shrimp is only offered as a side ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the worst part is over paying for steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stale food-dirty,I also believe I contacted slight traces of food poisoning from this very same,As for me I will never eat at this one again I'll cook my own food first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Way too many red flags for me to get my food here,I mean I know it's taco bell but still I don't want dog hair in my food or who knows what else the people are doing in there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great late night food choice :)  they got my whole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our tacos were absolutely STUFFED,my crispy potato taco (NOMNOM) had twice as much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll keep this on point: I just stopped for four Doritos Locos Fiery tacos,My tacos smelled ,and tasted like they had freezer burn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just tried to get some food from here ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My young son got horrendous food poisoning from this location a month ago,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and you may not even get one for your burrito,I also hope you don't care about taco sauce,because they rarely will give you more than one per taco,it's just very slow and they skimp on the taco sauce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just waited to order our food for 10 minutes in the drive thru after being told ""be right",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good quality food for Taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which makes it as high-quality as a Taco Bell can get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food here was easily the freshest I've tasted at a T-Bell in the Central Florida area,the girl even gave me a free bag of chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I finally get my food,I drive off and pull my food out ,I was offered my refund or they can make my food all over again,Not once did the manager come over to apologize for the service or the food that I recieved,they are open 24hrs and you won't have to waste valuable time on getting your food in a timely,There is a new taco place in the Publix plaza,they will be my new taco place,.steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,
my food is cold by the time I get home,How hard is it to not put sour cream on a freakin taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or food left out of the order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the products taste well ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they ran out of napkins but food comes quick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All I ordered was a couple tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All i have to say is the cheapest version of Mexican style food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered an am crunchwrap and I specified over and over about how there can be absolutely no meat in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two bean burritos,The burritos had a diameter of a golf ball,but when they skip on making a proper burrito,The beans tasted old,minus the cheese was a huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I noticed that the issue seemed to be the time it took to get food instead of the volume of customers, It would take about 5 minutes for each customer to get their food, I will probably give them another shot because of the convenience and my love for their burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've worked in the food service industry ,and I know it does not take that long to wrap some damn beans in a tortilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and a bean burrito with extra,weren't even on my bean burrito,A cool ranch supreme taco,Today my broken taco had no sour,add nacho cheese,and my sour cream and nacho cheese,add sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She forgot a burrito,didn't give us napkins and did not give us our guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco Bell will always be Taco Bell in terms of their food quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quality food,Shame as they are just a few minutes around the corner from my house,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My dog loves the chicken grillers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The beans were so dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered two chalupas sub beans for meat,Sometimes I would have to repeat the beans for meat,No meat,no cheese,no sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just wanted food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wife gets the bacon Chalupa and I went with the steak grande burrito with a hash browns on the side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I saw 2 people who ordered after me get their food prior to mine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great service & the food was way above another,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two words: crispy burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Drive thru is fast but food is barely thrown together,I would be willing to wait an extra 30 seconds to see some love put into my food,create a better experience and make food the proper,Today I ordered a side of rice ,In the past my tiny rice container is at least full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just like all other late night junk food places in Boulder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is like any other,A few times I've been given someone else's food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,friendly and good food,The food came out good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food comes out faster than most other,if you want fries with your cheesy bean and rice burrito,And borders on OCD-ness with the taco sauce packages neatly stacked,the girl happily asked if I wanted beans instead (,and their beans are good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The taco was crunchy ,And the price was very reasonable,My tostadas was very tasteful,Even my ice tea tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was watching the only white kid making my food,The mexican manager guy (im assuming) is extremely friendly though because when he hands out the food he always has a happy,These tacos have been a simple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My left big toe could make a better burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One time the person taking the orders was also the person preparing the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was consistent,timely and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hope you only like tacos,because this store was stocked out of ingredients to make any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can't say much about the food quality because I never got my food,"After contemplating this I decided to go elsewhere (not really having a choice then as I would FULLY expect ""Manny"" to spit in my food if they ever made any",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoy the #1 which is a burrito supreme ,and a taco supreme (crunchy),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After getting our drinks that had ice after we asked for no ice we got our food,didn't leave till after 11:30  had no idea it could even be possible for a taco drive thru to take so long,Just wanted to relax and have a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Paying welfare to these people is better than letting them make my tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had to try that Doritos Locos taco creation,""" so I got four bags of those delicious",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nothing special service is ok and honestly not sure why anyone comes to this place i would say no go go to taco tim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ALWAYS check your food before driving off from the Drive Thru, I always order a Crunchy Taco without meat,Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes and a Volcano Taco minus the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I'm very happy with the cheap prices but good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We were waiting for 30 MINUTES for 5 damn soft tacos,only reason not giving a 1/10 because my tacos were hawt at least,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This food is cheap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of the food was good,but the mold spores on one of the tacos is unforgivable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also got a fish plank (because I could) and was horrified to bite into a leathery chewy seafood abomination - must have spent hours under the heat lamp,Stopped by for the usual Taco Bell pilgrimage and was pleased by the reliably good burritos ,and tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good, I quit going there because I usually got the KFC chicken ,never out of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a terrible Taco Bell they couldn't get my order right I ordered a number six with chicken that's a chalupa  combo how ever I ended up with a steal,quesadilla with steak a protein I don't eat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will be driving further out of my way next time I go to a taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is okay,but the tacos are never stuffed full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I doubt anyone eats here actually depending on enjoying the food anyway,"I almost put two stars but then I remember I paid $8 for a horribly put together ""Mexican pizza"" and two surpreme tacos which is insane",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have come here more than 10x to pick up my food,you need to order your food off that app from now on,Your food will either be ready,3) Walk out/Drive out and head home to enjoy your food,etc however the app really eliminated any discrepancies and allowed me to expand my order and tailor my food to my liking,extra cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 This food is horrible,I finally got my food,The only reason I eat at this place is because it tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34 worth of food via the online system around 12:15 A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the shredded chicken mini quesadilla ,with melted cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Attempt 1: came here around 8pm to try the nacho fries only to find out they're out of the nacho cheese -__- ,The nacho cheese was a good,The inside tasted like mashed potatoes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Look I know this was a lot of bitching and complaining for a $5 box of food ,but in the long run I still paid money for specific food that I did not get so I am not happy,I don't like ranch or sour cream but I never eat the burrito so The only,Since I don't eat the burrito,the only thing I could eat was the hard taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went hear and the food we received was unacceptable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 One noticeable difference is that multiple people here speak english and the food is actually prepared, Save your money and hit up another fast-food resturant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very clean and great service / food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't order online if you want the food you actually ordered,the quality of the food is fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I am anything but an affected foodie,waiting in line for my seven layer burrito , Do I need that level of customer service to buy a burrito,be it tacos or a hotel room or overpriced cable TV, Yelpers have somehow managed to circumvent the mean-spirted and vapid state that has permeated so many,at the corner of Bethel ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst Taco Bell slow service and rude customer service glad chipotle is open,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am also a sucker for every new promotional food item TB comes out with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is pretty much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I mean the tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have the cheapest prices of any Taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she comes to window with the food,I ordered 1 meal and two tacos,states to talk to someone about experience call 1-800-taco-bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered and after 30 minutes our food still was not ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go here all the time but that's solely because I love Taco Bell's food ,this Taco Bell seems more akin to a prison cafeteria where the prisoners are forced to prepare the food,Every employee here seriously looks one burrito away from shooting up the place ,as long as you continue to put crack in your taco's I'll be back to get my fix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And for the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" I didn't know if my food was going to be safe",There's nothing like LYSOL covered tacos in the morning,I think it's great for the price,and sanitary so we decided best to go across the street to steak ,and not a cheeseburger in calories,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is cheap,but poor quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you might be worse off after you vomit due to the food not agreeing with your stomach,barely gives you any meat (wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Just handed us the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Order was wrong like way wrong on top of that my food looked like my 7 year old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also they don't put enough ingredients in their food,It seems they don't change oil often and that causes stale and sticky taco shell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hey if you want to get food poisoning here ,and have them serve you beef when you are allergic to beef and order chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they know the proper way to make a Mexi-melt (not too much meat,a healthy balance of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They got my order out pretty fast on a Friday night and all the food tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nacho Doritos taco & they ALWAYS have STALE shells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i highly recommend the beefy Fritos burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was fresh,burrito, $8 for a taco,sides of sour cream , and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but there are four people here waiting for food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I finally get my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burrito supreme ,and a taco supreme,onions and a chunky type of salsa,This enchirito had meat,What I'm used to is a cheese enchilada,with gobs of cheese (no complaints on the blanket of cheese on top of the sauce) instead of a smooth,It just doesnt taste the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is usually decent, It seems that going through the drive thru and going inside usually take the same amount of time to get you your food ( FOREVER),Fast food is suppose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is exactly what you pay for - ,but occasionally I have a craving for a quick and crappy crunchy taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But you mostly come for the food,Rn there's a $5 steak nacho,very little steak ,I think u should wait for steak,the steak shouldn't be waiting for u,the nachos tasted dated),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love taco Bell breakfast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered two chicken grilled stuffd burritos in the drive thru,At the office I started to eat only to find whoever made my chicken burritos seemed to overlook the small,My coworker laughed until he sliced open and dissected his burrito to find,and obvious absence of chicken in what should have been a chicken burrito,and rice , step of adding chicken in the assembly,but not one shred of chicken,beans,Plenty of sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,
Just ordered 8 soft taco SUPREMES with beans ,and no meat at the drive through, Got home and had no tomato and no sour cream on any of them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food here is most likely,if they seasoned the food there even a little,sat and pepper available for seasoning the food,The only other thing that comes to mind that is food related is that the bean,but that is just me since I like my beans whole,The meat sits under lamps or in heaters of some kind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Taco Bell is always slow on getting out your food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered my food at 9:49pm,he had been waiting for his food for about 20 minutes,I work in the food industry too ,not once did he check up on my food,"I'm cussing at them and I let them know: ""give me a f-ing refund or give me my f-ing food",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered steak gorditas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" It's infuriating waiting 20 minutes for the 3 cars ahead of you to get their ""fast"" food",what could possibly take so long to make 3 tacos, Are they grinding the corn for the tortillas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Slowest Taco Bell ever and everything I ever get here is made so sloppy it's almost inedible unless I get a fork or spoon but that's just not how I'd like to eat my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just your basic needs like good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can't imagine the food will be right ,then gave me full refund with food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Took me 20 minutes to get tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even the varsity has better food,Steak and shake is across the street and has real food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Haven't had to wait long for food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
waited half hour [+] for our food that is generous,we order a double beef taco burrito,2 nacho dorito tacos,and a chicken quesadilla ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A minute later they just throw you your food ,I give an additional star because the food has always been good,oh and let's not forget the only thing you ordered was 2 mini chicken quesadilla ,Enough time to drive around the corner ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am a huge fan of their Verde salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is what I expect from a Taco Bell,Getting food here is hell at lunchtime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worst Taco Bell I've been to the five layer burrito was five layer burrito no meat more bread,no beans more bread,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is not the first time I've gotten bad service and food,My Doritos taco was soggy,My chalupa was stale and filled with both chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They started charging extra to substitute beans for the meat as of 12/27/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always hot,I have gotten the sausage burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so after waiting 15+ minutes for your food 95% of the time it is terribly terribly wrong,I ordered a bean and cheese burrito,And somehow ended up with a chipotle ranch and nacho cheese burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I pulled up to the window I see this creepy employee just grab some food from the kitchen ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Paid for extra sauce and wasn't on any of the food,Messed up every taco was incorrect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I could have went into market basket next door and made my self tacos at home by now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How hard is it to omit lettuce from one box and tomatoes & sour cream from another,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great prices for yummy food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Weird I didn't know making a taco took 20+ minutes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They refused and said we had to wait in the line again to get our food,We went around and asked the car at the window if they could get us the food for us,Literally took our money and didnt give us our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a spicy tostada fresco style and a grilled 7 layer burrito fresco,There were four things wrong with the burrito,guacamole was added for some reason,They got the tostada right but it only came with four bits of diced tomatoes actually on the tostada and  there were about ten bits on the cardboard box along with some lettuce strewn off to the side,there was no lettuce 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
waiting over 30 mins for my food in Drive-thru ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty run down and not the greatest food,some regular tacos,( I refuse to call that salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you go through the drive thru make sure they give you all of your food before you drive away,Also their burritos are so much,they've consistently forgot 1 taco every time I have gone through or been in another car going through,thinner than almost any Taco Bell I have ever been to- I understand it's cheap fast food but at least give me my dollars worth of fake beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so our food came out quick,this Taco Bell gets 2 stars because although their food is usually just like any other,so all I ordered was two crunchy tacos,and I finally started to eat my first taco , The beef inside the taco was warm,but I really did not enjoy the taco shell,my second taco's shell was crunchy,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the new cantina double steak quesadilla ,It was cut into only 3 pieces and only one piece had steak in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grab a couple of tacos or maybe a burrito with all the stuff and go back to your life occasionally this is a junk food I want ,It is going taste the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The man at the window when we got our food looked high, Paid for the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Been waiting in the drive through line for the past 40 minutes and still haven't gotten food,"This place is the polar opposite of ""fast"" food",Seriously all we ordered was 2 hard shell tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very clean and great service / food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
com/food/menuitem/Cheese-Roll-Up,I'll get a burrito from the drive-thru,[http://www.tacobell,It's basically a tortilla with cheese,a tortilla with cheese,and get a pack of tortillas and a pack of cheese for less than you paid for two Cheese,And it tasted like,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My taco shell was crispy,The prices are really reasonable,The meat quality was excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's cheap delicious tacos what do you expect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The past three times I've come here in the past twice months the food has been great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came in to the drive thru and ordered some tacos,I ordered hard tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had to ask for the rest of my food again,ordered chicken quesadilla ,and got just cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came in with my kids and there was only one person in front of us already waiting for his food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food came out pretty quickly as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
half bean burritos ,and half soft tacos,FYI: I think the Bell needs to bring back the cinnamon chips of my childhood,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not like my food was done,She gave us the food *3 mins later* ,having edible food isn't all that's gonna keep you guys in business, The cheese was barley melted in our quesadilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So then he comes back to me and I told him what I want and he asked steak or chicken and then tells me crazy price,"but can do steak and chicken""",Next thing he looks at this older couple next to me and is all nice when he offers to replace their beef with steak or chicken,"I questioned it and he says ""there is an up charge for the steak""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went one night ordered two $5 dollar box w the burrito,taco etc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I realize that this review is focused towards the one person I encountered in my visit  but the food surpassed my expectations,He was incredibly professional and made me and my family feel comfortable about their quality of freshness that we stopped by even though it was late,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tasty tacos to be served to you expediently, I went with the 3 crunchy tacos, It took 17 minutes from the time I ordered (I checked the time stamp on my receipt) for me to get 3 crunchy tacos, Everything tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She handlers a while line of cars perfectly and for that I thank her for my burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I opt for the powerbowl no meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you like the worst stalky hard chunks of lettuce being the primary ingredient and little to no cheese even if you pay for extra for it in your Taco Bell then this is the location for you,All the employees seem to be trained to make everything 80% lettuce stalks and 2% cheese,Even if you ask for light lettuce and extra cheese,It almost seems like the place is solely there to push out the most undesirable garbage stalk ends of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also realized that they were missing a burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Was excited because there are not any other Taco Bell's in the area & I ever so often need my taco-fix,while waiting for my taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I still go there despite the torturous wait because I like the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but you are still paying the same price,It is the quality that is really lacking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've also been there when they've been out of chicken,What kind of Taco Bell runs out of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,The employees would say your name when your food was ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All i can say is that the food here at this Taco Bell is horrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered our food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go there for late night food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered two bean and cheese burritos with no onions ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast food my ass,Waiting 15 minutes and counting for some tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited 15 minutes for my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast food chain franchises are only successful,They also usually leave some ingredients out of the burritos,Most of the tables caked with cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Every now and again I get to jonesing for some Nachos that are drenched in 'cheese' sauce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food tasted horrible,The taco shell had this awful, chemical taste to it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Told me my sauce was in the bag but it wasn't and my chicken chalupa was missing ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pay $4 and wait for 30 minutes for a half full burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went there recently and the food was ok as it usually is,I probably won't get food here again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Granted the food IS Taco Bell,so it wasn't exceptionally delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I complained to the staff and manager about the wait because this was the 5th time I'd had to wait over 20 minutes for my food at this location,They told me to come back tomorrow from 1:00pm to 5:00pm to get free food,I told them I'm not complaining to get anything I'm just pissed because the whole reason anyone comes to Taco Bell is because it's meant to take 5 min to get your food ,They got pissed at me and passive aggressively tossed my food on the counter,cheesy Gordita crunch and a Doritos locos taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food,and our food was thrown out the window along with gross,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just substitute meat for beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are always slow as hell with getting your food together,Don't really like this taco Bell,3 packs of sauce for 6 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When we checked our food everything thing was wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The last night we went again around 11pm and ordered our food,I explained that I did not have any cash and he told me that he was sorry I could not pay with my card or have my food,l and still wasn't able to get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  Wait for food was way too long for taco bell, And then the girl tells me they are out of chips (on a prev,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Disgusting food ,and let me tell you the wawas quesadillas are way better quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then today I ordered 4 crunchy taco supremes ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is very well priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Watch out for the unwritten price list, I placed my order of an item with the price clearly listed, The manager only shrugged and refused to honor the listed price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to charge close to or sometimes over $10 for the garbage they pass off as food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
During this day a employee helped a choking child :) and the food was amazing the sweet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the foods consistently good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and we were waiting for the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesn't make sense why this Taco Bell is closed for 30 minutes either I need my refunds back or something free I am waiting in the front of Taco Bell why this food that they gave me is getting cold,and I need my food that I ordered I am really f,i be back in morning this shit maybe food too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a crunch wrap with no lettuce and got lettuce and they forgot a burrito ,and the best part was that there was a hair in my wife's pintos and cheese # boycot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had ordered food before this incident happened ,My friend got a refund and his food ,All I wanted was a $5 craving and a steak quesarito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(Be warned of the traffic during peak shopping hours) The staff appears to be different every time but I've never had an issue with my food other,A chalupa is essentially a fried taco shell ,TB isn't your hole in the wall cantina but it'll pass whenever you're craving a quick fix for some tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cashier can't do simple math and unwilling to substitute more rice for ,did rice become a precious,cheese ,when removing sour cream,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Slowest service in the history of food service,Was in line for 45 minutes no exaggeration to get tacos at 10p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The dumb people ran out of beef and then charged me extra for other options (chicken ,and steak),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not even and offer to pull foward and I bring your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my girlfriend and our friend b ok th got there food , I just want the food I played for,which still hasn't been resolved or even contacted back and said we are sorry and you can come get the food you paid for at the least,00 burrito  to compensate for the $5,2nd We had 2 separate orders which the employee said it was fine and told us the price for each one as probably she is supposed to do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Currently still waiting for my food to come,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And food wise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lettuce on the one taco I got was nasty,They must've used a different sauce or the beans out too long,lettuce isn't suppose to be soggy,when I got home I discovered that the grillers tasted,Cuz it just did not taste good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no food coming out,my daughter saw the girl behind the counter out back picking out food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ordering my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was 3am and I tried going to taco Cabana,It's supposedly a 24hr place but it wasn't open  however taco Bell (which was supposed to be closed) continued to take our orde,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it said that the order was received and that the food would be prepared,I got my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Take away food Cold on being given it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chicken,nacho cheese,we were told they were out of the ingredients, Maybe it was a terrible GM who didn't order the basic ingredients to their entire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoyed visiting Taco Bell for breakfast they have a lot of good choices however I would love it if chicken was added to the breakfast menu or Turkey sausage was added to the breakfast menu I got an egg ,however I was charged for bacon and I didn't get bacon so that's disappointing if I could have the option of adding Turkey sausage even turkey bacon our chicken that will be wonderful,and cheese breakfast quesadilla ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We went through drive to pick up some on-the-go food before heading out to meet friends,We saw someone that was dealing in food prep go up to the cashier with gloves on to help someone (he tapped on the cashiers screen at the indoor,register) and return back to the food prep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not for the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took about 15 minutes for my food to come out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food wasn't even warm,Poor customer service and food,the Doritos locos taco was stale-ish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love ordering from the cheapo menu such as the 1/2 pound burrito ,3 crunchy taco meal taker,the shredded cheese can be sometimes dried out and the meat is probably a grade D,the lettuce is limpy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is not cooked enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then one employee opened one of the tacos to confirm it was correct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
People that work there are really friendly and the food is never that bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like a 45 min drive through wait and only ""if"" you get your food it's not always what you ordered",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I ordered two bean and cheese burritos-as is,and one bean and cheese burrito with NO onions,the beans were in liquid, Not like soft beans (like other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Same with my tacos,I never knew you could do that with the tacos so I was really happy,Make sure you got some hot nacho cheese on the side and throw it on your tacos ,I got the Mexican pizza and swapped out the meat for some beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality ,the food came out so poorly packaged that crunchy tacos were crushed ,and one was completely opened with contents spilled all over the other food,making those paper wrappers tear and the food inside became wet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is typical,Taco Bell food,TB corporate could produce better food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There aren't many late night options for food,if you want late night food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the ""window timer"" in the drive through hit 24 minutes before we got our food",and my girlfriend and I both finished our food before the car behind us got their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gave me the option for chicken on my nachos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The watermelon freeze tasted like straight up medicine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Taco Bell is terrible clearly every one that works here Give no shits about there job at all they take forever and mess up even if you get a soft taco without lettuce but when you look at your taco there's gonna be lettuce on it lmao there not friendly at all and this Taco Bell will not be getting any more of my money the cheese on my chili cheese burrito wasn't even melted I'm throwing it away is getting hot food to much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was a carry out order and there were about 3 burritos ordered,One of the burritos was the Cheesy Bean ,and Rice burrito to accommodate a vegetarian,Got home and could not identify the Cheesy Bean burrito from the Beef burrito,When we did have everyone break their burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We got our order and there was 1/2 the amount of meat as normal in our supreme tacos,Flat corn tortilla anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I still don't have my items and my food has gotten cold,Manager comes back with my missing items and I noticed that my food,"I asked him politely if he could redo my meal since it had gotten cold and he said ""no because there is too much people here"" I reply ""but as a manager it's your duty to try and correct your error"" then he proceeds to tell me that he was not going to remake my food",no burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered food inside at 8:24 ,got my food at 8:44,I see people standing around doing nothing behind the counter and a lobby full of people just waiting for their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was mediocre at best ,and the Taco shells taste old plus the food wasn't that warm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got a Crunchwrap supreme with no meat in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
F'n trash they up-charged me on nachos and cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sucks because this is the closest taco Bell to me ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 20 minutes for a bean burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only got a half full container of nacho bell grande and ordered extra cheese which was not included,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited 5 min for new potatoes to cook and they give me 3 potatoes for the spicy potatoes tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I order a bean burrito ONLY ,but it turned out that it had something more than just beans,It seemed like they either used the same spoon for beef and beans or else they realized it was suppose,to be beans ,and just added beans to the beef,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To pay for food ,And she's in the background saying you only get some odd scoops of meat,The other had barely any mean/cheese on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get my food ,to lackluster food quality ,and a bean burrito,two soft tacos,I was given a medium Mountain Dew and a chicken quesadilla,those chicken nacho, chips they had at the time,and my toddler loves him a cheese roll up,Like with cheese,just the cheese quesadilla,"""So one cheese quesadilla",one cheese quesadilla ,and the cheese quesadilla,and a cheese roll up,,,,,,
The first time I went here the service was excellent - friendly and accurate with good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two stars because once I do get the food it is usually hot,but I wish I could rate the food separate from the service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's been 25 minutes since ordering my food  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I wouldn't ever trust them to make my food during this p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63 and patronizing explanation that it's a franchise and their prices may vary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We get the food, Before removing the food out of the bag,We gobbled down the tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food looks like it was left under a warmer all day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I often have complicated orders with substituting meat for beans ,and removing the cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All i ask is NOOOOO sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is really fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's just that the food was cold, and tasted awful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went for 2 six packs of the naked chicken chips,They thought the extra chicken roll ups they threw in would make up for their lateness ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got home with my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who helped me figure out a way to order nachos with just meat on them (no cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered through Uber eats and they served me expired food,The chicken smelt rotten like it got left out of the refrigerator for days before getting cooked,I also ordered a chicken ,and cheese melt ,and there was barely any cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think them for working on a Sunday evening to provide us with food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I had a good experience in terms of food ,or even really good food,I had a seven-layer burrito, It's like KFC's Double Down: a chicken breast molded into taco shape,beans,and cheese, It actually held up really well as a vessel for the other ingredients,tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's rly good I like their beans a lot their lava sauce was dank ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm rating this as a Taco Bell - I'm not giving their food 3 stars,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
long wait times and terrible food remains consistent,One night I ordered 3 beef and cheese tacos through the drive through ,and got home to find that while they did give me 3 tacos,No meat,No cheese,the only ingredient in them was LETTUCE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they were soggy pieces of potato with warmish cheese sauce resembling the poop I took last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Getting anything that's supposed to be crunchy to go is risky because the hard shell tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We love taco Tuesday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or food quality,for the food,we got our food,we ordered three burritos , We were missing a burrito ,and another burrito was wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I work less than a mile from it and go only when I want cheap food,but was immediately waited on and the food is actually better,I finally went to Moe's right around the corner-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once we sit down our food comes (really quickly ,And I got the same thing again sometime later and it had a piece of chicken in it,Another time I buy pintos and cheese (beans with melted cheese on top,and hot sauce) and it looks like they took the cheese straight from the bag and slapped it on the hot beans,he orders it and i say that I'd like it to have half cheese after my brother ordered ,I taste the oni,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is never prepared correctly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went there a few days ago and they put the guac in the very bottom of my burrito somehow,Tonight I decided to get the guac on the side and I get a cold VERY dry burrito with small, bits of cheese ,when I asked for no cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I paid for 6 Taco supreme and 2 crunchy tacos ,and I only found 3 taco supreme ,and 3 crunchy tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast food, he took my order then disappeared as i waited quite a while to get my food,I havent been to Taco Bell in years but was craving tacos as i past by,i planned on getting three crunchy taco supremes ,but i noticed the stacked tacos whIch were onky,(Crunchy taco supremes $1,The crunchy taco supremes were totally broken,and the stacked was almost totally dEvoid of the cheese whiCh was supposed to be seepinG between the two layers,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food is correct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63 and patronizing explanation that it's a franchise and their prices may vary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We just bypassed our order after that wait and didn't even pick up our food,Not worth it to pay for the food after waiting for 30+ minutes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The sink hole at the end of the drive through is so wild I can't even get taco Bell cuz the lobby is closed ,If I want taco Bell I have to ruin my bumper going through this 4x4 course,I just wanted some tacos,I just want taco Bell ,but I guess I'll have to start getting taco trucks cuz at least I can navigate the terrain to get to them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also got our 3 soft taco order wrong,and gave us hard tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My daughter loves plain meat tacos with no lettuce ,and no cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always check my food ,My food is always fresh,They also will add extra cheese to burritos if you ask with no extra,I can just order cheese and chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been to this location about 10 times and every time I wait for at least 30 minutes for my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is pretty good,On the tacos,The only downside was the chips on the nachos seemed a bit stale,sour cream) and the meat was warm,the toppings were all fresh and cold (cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always gets the order wrong and the attitude my God props to them for having that much attitude working at a taco Bell my Go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got my food , I parked and found that Evilyn had made yet another mistake 3 missing tacos out of an order of 3 tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that'll ensure your customizations are sent to the food line correctly,Your food will have to travel out thru the seating area,food gets cold,The food is hit or miss,The new chicken chalupa I ordered 2 weeks ago was nice,sometimes I'll get high quality,but at least half of the orders are low quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and a burrito,I just had a supreme taco,The boy had taco salad with steak,chicken cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It good but there some thing wrong with the bean burritos becus  my sister ate some ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I still would have gave a great review because I had no issues with the visit or the food,) they gave a couple free tacos as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And he gave me the wrong food,Spent 16 dollars for 2 tacos ,and 2 soft tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went there on the fourth and the employees were great and had my food out instantly,I had the power burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have missed food deletions because of allergies,and burn grilled stuffed burritos almost every time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get suckered into buying new novelty food,The food was as expected ,$6 for breakfast crunch wrap and the naked chicken chips,Don't get the naked chicken chips,It's like bad triangle chicken nuggets with plastic, cheese sauce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And we all got trapped in the drive thru when we decided we didn't want rice for dinner,Out of meat and out of beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it makes it a lot easier to satisfy my taco cravings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My food was not cooked, I know everything just needs to be heated up but all of my taco shells were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do they get the same food we do,yet you can order 4 tacos,and one is missing cheese,and another has only a few pieces of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sitting on what appeared to be a food prep table,Ended up throwing my food away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food came out quick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The crunchy tacos are good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The nachos looked like they were made by a child and the gentleman that took my credit card for payment was wearing rubber gloves and was working on the food line,He did not change gloves between the car in front of me and me which tells me he was handling money and touching food without hesitation,This restaurant is filthy when I've gone inside and the service/food quality is always sub,When I finally received my food I checked to make sure,overcooked/undercooked food,the food to be  cooked properly ,employees handling food ,and money and the undercooked food,Therefore I ordered the #7 combo with a chicken quesadilla and a chicken soft taco,I opened the soft taco expecting chicken,Find beef in the soft taco ,The entire soft taco was frozen,I'm assuming they rushed the beef to the line even though it wasn't cooked despite the fact I requested chicken,The quesadilla was also overcooked once again with minimal chicken ,The queasarito was warm at best and with minimal meat,I also ordered a steak quesarito ,,,,
99 burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our bean burritos were at least a day old,the taco shells were soo,You know how del tacos tacos are usually pretty empty,Well these tacos made even them embarrassed,beans much too over cooked,First the forgot my chips ,and cheese (the one thing you'd think they couldn't mess up) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service has always been alright and same with the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customer service is always amazing and food is ALWAYS FRESH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not even food thoroughly cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also don't skimp meat like other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had ordered a black bean Crunchwrap Supreme due to being vegetarian when I bit into the order I come to my surprise I find a ground beef Crunchwrap Supreme my receipt said black bean I called the store spoke with the manager they said to come up and get replacement food I arrived at the location after just being out ,and sure enough they are out of black beans in simply just tried to replace them with ground beef because apparently ground beef is now a vegetarian option according to this tacobell it's been a long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even a perfect day the food is,my ratings are based on the location/branch rather than the food,if you are reading taco bell Yelp for food quality,Slowest tacobell around,tacobell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What kind of stupid asswipes allow your food to come out look,lowest quality Taco Bell in Austin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I order 5 Doritos loco tacos,Our tostada had a taco shell broken in half,I know they did it on purpose because they didn't bother asking to check the tacos,The chipotle loaded griller had two pieces of chicken, instead of the beef I got chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
final time to get food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ordered two bean burritos ,and they gave me literally a taco with beans added wrapped in a burrito tortilla,bean burritos dont come with meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I could see a couple employees smoking pot with their friends in the parking lot and thought about pushing the issue but didn't want bodily secretions in my food,I went to the Wendy's across the parking lot instead and don't you know I drive by after getting my food ,So if you need some drugs head to this Taco Bell but if you're just looking for food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered 3 taco supremes & a drink,one soft taco,The soft taco is barely wrapped ,and has spilled unto the other tacos in the bag,Now I'm gathering the ingredients to put the taco back together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also they seem to scamp you on the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wonderful food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and he stopped here for food,the cute guy I was involved with at the time was upset they had jacked the price of tacos up from $0,and without his tacos,Brian ordered a chicken quesadilla,"maybe they should just bring a U-HAUL and cart away bulk tubs of ""meat"" ","and ""cheese""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The same person gave my food to me at the window,Taco Bell food is not amazing,2 bean burritos,2 crunchy tacos, There were napkins and a good amount of taco sauce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" I finally got my food ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Burritos are far better then the tacos they should consider calling them self BURRITO BEL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because this taco bell is ALWAYS out of grilled chicken at night: if it's not grilled chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finally got the food right at 10pm,Finally got our food ,This taco is awful,and a chicken roll up meal,a cheese roll up,and the cheese wasnt even melted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for a steak taco,"Very quickly and already full of attitude I was ""notified"" that since they were out of ground beef i would have to pay MORE for chicken or steak",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast food restaurants can always be a little,My food was HOT - which I'm not used to from Taco Bell,hot food,great food,My taco supreme was full,That's how I like my tacos,You usually get like a few teaspoons of every ingredient ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The drinks were reasonably priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quality of the food was there ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not worth the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just the most expensive rice you will be charged for in the U,"Here's a first: you arrive at Taco Bell to find they are ""out of beans ",and meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I noticed that the prices here are more expensive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Switching soft and hard tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other Taco Bells give you food,What I like is that they don't rush when it comes to making your food,the Crunchwrap Supreme with grilled chicken,$1 menu shredded chicken quesadilla,The meat is tender ,I swear they're the most delicious ,which pays off A LOT when it comes to quality,and fresh and it tastes like a lot of effort was put into making each item on the menu,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food's solid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered 5 tacos like 20 minutes ago ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Was told they were no longer offering 7 layer burrito ,and I should just get a burrito without meat ,59 bean burrito,rice beans,"lettuce,beans ",Only ingredients on it were very soupy refried beans ,and cheese,and a small amount of cheese,sour cream,may 3 tiny pieces of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,
sub beef for beans,86 cheese sauce) ,86 sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but for some reason they couldn't understand that and ended up giving me the wrong food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a Saturday night at 11:45pm and they are sayin tit will take 45 min to receive my order due to them replenishing the food line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is usually good,(sorry we wanted to give you more business- wont happen again (probably will tho because food is good,they were rushing us and really made us feel bad for ordering food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Called to have them replaced because if I wanted to go eat tortilla chips ,Ordered a $5 chalupa box and a $5 steak nacho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First time we ordered 6 tacos only beef ,and there was rice,beans,and nacho cheese in it,The second time they put lettuce in our party size box ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which was fine since they were busy but after a long time and finally getting home I found my food to be servilely messed up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or you have to wait 30-40 minutes just to get your food, Hopefully the manager figures something out because not being able to get a refund on over 25 dollars of food is ridiculous,they informed us that they were out of chips and a few other things and could offer us a certain type of burrito instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have no quality control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food I ordered tasted,I can actually get cheaper tacos ,and higher quality tacos on a taco Tuesday by other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just wanna say that I don't ever eat fast food because I'm a chef but everytime I go to this location there is always something wrong went the other day a pulled up only to here the cashier say we are only doing no more then 5 items lol who ever the owner is I just wanna say they are such cheap bastard for not hiring workers every time that I've gone they are never fully staff just got a cashier and a cook 2 people to probably serve a 100 customers through there 7-10 shift please shut this place down because it is so embarrassing that your staff won't make a taco party pac because it's more then 5 items get it together ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for my drinks and the other half of our food,I ordered two 4 packs of the rolled chicken tacos,I was given a bag with half the rolled tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're in a mall food court for jesus sake,eat tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23 minutes for a soft taco and burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's always a problem with my food every time called corporate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nacho Bell Grande no sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
third time I've gone there and I get home with food for me ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They always get my picky orders correct and everything is always hot (probably because I order so much stuff without certain ingredients so they're probably not able,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Still waiting for food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but as long as the food tastes good, My only real complaint was the size of the burrito, Have you ever noticed that every Taco Bell has different size burrito's for the same,burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually order the power bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems like they really happy if you like their food ,The food come out really fast,And it's very important for my friends because they eat only kosher food,so when we order taco without meat just with vegetables they always ask if we would love some extra, beans ,I didn't give them one more star because i notice that sometimes their cheese are not as fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I've eaten authentic Mexican food,I did not find one instance of Dorito taco shells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited at least a half hour after I placed my order to get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got a stank look from the lady who gave me my food,there was chicken in my cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and bean burritos with no onions,This is my favorite Taco Bell to go to late at night when I've had one too many drinks and just HAVE to have a taco before I die,I'd be lost without you and your soft tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I understand that Taco Bell isn't high quality food,Every time I've been there the food is cold,It's got to be a problem with their equipment because I refuse to believe that every employee there intentionally doesn't fully cook any of the food,and they frequently forget to put all of the Taco ingredients on the tacos,the cheese on the gordita crunch is never melted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It gets you your food correctly in a mostly timely,The food tastes just like other,Easiest since the food doesn't really taste all that different,$7 for a burrito,This taco Bell is decent,it's taco Bell,if you want the #1 and aren't dying for the supreme taco with tomatoes,taco ,Oh and the naked chalupa chicken taco - overrated,Just get the ground beef like their normal tacos,The location is a bit hidden so you may want to use your GPS but it's near bowlmor,Oh and the naked chalupa chicken - overrated,I tried it during this trip and the chicken is super,thin like the chicken fries you get at BK,sour cream,,,,,
Line moves well and food is always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How does a Taco Bell run out of ground beef and then decide they would charge you extra for chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 bean and cheese burritos,Who puts lettuce in only 1 of the 3 burritos,just bean and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They should be ashamed of theirselves for serving this food,But that's no excuse for bad food,& I ordered an extra 2 tacos,The tacos were basically just brown lettuce & cheese with barely any meat in them,there was only a teaspoonful of meat on each chalupa,& sour cream was scarce,the lettuce was brown,you should be serving quality until 1am,,,,,,,,,,,,
One asked for 3 tacos ,The other asked for a cheese and chicken quesadilla ,and got a bean and cheese quesadilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is my baseline for cheap basic Mexican style food,If I need a late night fix and don't want to drive to TV highway and 185th or Forest Grove for real Mexican food this is where I head,A taco with fire and bean burrito then I'm golden,For the price it can't be beaten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you go to the drive-thru you will sit in line and wait 5 minutes at a minimum per car just to order and then the same to pick up your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just paid way too much for 2 soft taco ,and a regular taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was also the best Taco Bell I have ever had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I new the fake cheese to close the deal every time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
an hr later I was having food poison symptoms,The food was good,but I would have to rate the cleanliness of the food to be horrible,I ordered three taco supreme,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
.food is taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is heavy,I don't eat meat and Taco Bell will substitute beans for any meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a steak cantina bowl from this location,As me and my son was sharing my bowl,The cantina bowl does not come with Nacho cheese,Turns out it's the package for nacho cheese hence the nacho,cheese still in the plastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited 18 minutes to get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The tacos were not your regular,just nice little tacos,It was nicely wrapped with a warm tortilla with an each ingredient placed carefully inside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got a couple burritos ,And it would be nice to cook the rice all the way through,and the rice was so hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered one crunchy beef taco fresco,style and one chicken soft taco fresco,I really like the salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cold food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in terms of the food,and either the restaurant employees or the meat plant is responsible,meat serving is trivial,the freshness of vegetables like the lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my burritos are always filled to the brim with mouth-watering," ""meat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like pretty much like  everything here especially their Dorito nacho cheese tacos,But my one complaint would be that they use very lil meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I reached the window I noticed an animated male employee handling the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have forgotten food multiple,cold food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Disappointed with food even in the context of Taco Bell,Nachos had some cheese that wasn't melted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food though is always the best part,the taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very pleased-wanted breakfast tacos for the office on short,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good fast pretty decent food don't really eat there meat only there chicken because i personally believe there beef is not any good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVERYTIME I come here my food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have to say that the food is great,I realized they forgot my taco,I claimed that I was through the Drive thru without a taco ,"and he said ""oh"" and he walked to his manager for my taco",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At this time I realized I ordered the food for my children ,Then proceeded to throw bag after bag of food in our car window at my husband,We asked to add a taco ,She took the credit card from my husband and yelled into the cooks that she needed another taco,After we received the last taco we ordered we started to leave the parking lot ,Then when we got home we realized the drinks were just carbination and our tacos were half,Also valentine decided to hide behind the kitchen equipment while her other coworkers came around the corner trying to see who was talking to their manager about their customer service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a chicken quesadilla, It was lukewarm and the cheese wasn't even melted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks for my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Watched burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We get our COLD food ,and noticed that we were missing two tacos,87 for the tacos that we paid for already,This lady comes back to the window with the nastiness attitude ever and told us that she actually gave us two extra tacos (which she didn't) ,Had to throw the extra tacos that we paid for again away because I thought someone spit in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a plain chicken taco ,they gave me chicken and cheese melted on taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who doesn't love some Taco Bell late at night when you're desperate for a taco or just some food to keep you from bouncing off of the walls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I really don't know what to say about the food,I always order the same thing with a slight modification and I've never been given any flack for getting a soft taco in lieu of the crispy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is never consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As a purveyor of all spicy foods,as familiar tastes and textures of elementary school lunchroom food wafted through the air,and a soft steamed burrito exterior,offering an aggregated approach to taco procurement,the taco was crispy,and within minutes had consumed both of my hard-shell tacos,by the ground beef and Dorito flavored taco shells before is,as it is quite impossible with any semblance of maturity to eat a red-dyed taco out of a paperboard holder ,While the taco shell ,and soft taco outer layer provided excellent,I would have been treated to a Fiery taco within the Cheesy Gordita Crunch Wrap,At this point I felt two things: The first being that even after my triple-taco spread,the internal crunchiness of seasoned chips,and shredded cheddar cheese in successive,lettuce,and the lettuce was even,the ingredients were hot,but captivated my interest for its complex taste built upon a fairly straightforward,taste) have perhaps the strongest connection to memory than any other,
It seems as if they aren't making enough food at all of being lazy,It's a disappointed to be waiting for a few minutes for your food (5-7, To receive barely any food ,I've came 3x and every time I had barely any meat let alone anything in tacos burritos or whatever I ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the customer service was great and the tacos were filling,I got 3 regular tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All i know is i have going here WAAAAYY too often since the Doritos tacos came out,I get the Doritos Taco Supreme with beans instead of beef,This location has consistently had better quality ,it tastes like trailer trash 7 layer dip in the best possible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight's chicken crunch wrap supreme had VERY little,Simply disappointed in my ever strong craving for my chicken crunch wrap supreme, sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If your wondering how someone can stay in line for 30 minutes and get a warm drink with melted ice and tacos that need to be put back in the microwave,If corporate offices wonder why the taco truck selling tacos for 2$ are so busy,it's because customers will risk a taco from a truck that doesn't have an endless,Taco Bell take notes from these taco trucks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have to bend over to keep from food dropping in our lap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Regular price they are around $3,but soon my tastebuds adjusted ,Watermelon Freeze: This Freeze tasted just like watermelon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My grandfather and ordered our food ,Never in my life have I seen a Taco Bell employee cuss right in front of a 12 year old sitting with his grandfather eating his food,the food was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Writing this review on the service since everywhere you go the food at Taco Bell is the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wage is having stupid increases ever July 1st so its just gonna push food prices back to the consumers (thanks dumb,I think they raised their prices again at the start of the year, government) but it seems like this Taco Bell raises priced ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll go eat my garbage food somewhere else,When I got my order for a single cheese quesadilla (I had to give up on the stuffed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
power aid tastes like old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hands us the food ,it didn't have tomatoes that I added to my burritos ,and the tortilla chips for the nachos tasted like boiled ass,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I stopped by today to get some food with a coworker,We waited there for a while and finally got our food,I asked my friend to check the bag because I had a pretty good feeling our food wasn't going to be right,"I was nice to him and told him that I did not need a drink when he asked he then proceeded to yell at me and tell me ""then you just want regular tacos",I got regular tacos, instead of supreme and she had a chicken quesadilla instead of steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
crunchy tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I come here they don't serve me food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the staff were incredibly rude and the food took almost 10 minutes to make,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even though my wife and son incorrectly order their bean burritos with no onions ,Throw in some cheesy roll ups (which let's be honest is just a tortilla with some melted cheese with a fancy name to trick kids in to getting it) some soft tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food served at this Taco Bell is the worse that I've had,Waited over 30 minutes in the drive thru line and came home to super cold food ,Also ordered the power steak burrito ,and shredded chicken burrito which were both terribly cold,I ordered a double chalupa box and the chalupa and tacos were broken up,99 each of which they gave me soft tacos instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the woman who took our order and gave us our food was so nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now if they would only put some cheese on the food,The pictures and the actual food you get ,Real cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was correctly prepared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the quality of food is just piss,Used to be my go-to for a quick and easy delicious meal,some weird chemical taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have yet to be here once where I didn't have to pull forward and wait at least 5 mins for my food, The food was thrown together ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b) have enjoyed the food I've ordered from here,The food I've received here has always been hot,accurate and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now in fairness I should not be expecting Mexican food that is only 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Taco Bell has chili cheese burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" When I called to ask how late they were open I was told ""we are short staffed and running low on food",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The menu is as described and food is always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good service but priced really high for taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They consistently get my order incorrect and sometimes experience waits of over 30 minutes for my food after its ordered,Making tacos on a line isn't that hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Prices affordable, Food always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Crunchy tacos,They must have magical ingredient matching fairies at HQ,Just when you thought it impossible to mix and match 7 ingredients a different,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
) When I have tried returning the food for a refund one time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You may have a hard time understanding immigrants over the intercom but Ill take their food over this shit anyday,They got hostile when I went back and got a refund for a meal that had missing or hardly any ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco bell is my bad day food,the food is pretty much,sometimes my food looks particularly smooshed or small,That's another pain because it's a really busy taco bell at night at waiting 30+ minutes for the nacho chips they didn't put in the bag the first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's a food court,I tried the Dorito taco thing,which tasted like a taco that someone had put some Doritos in,which I had to taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like a gas station burrito,as in I did not have a lot of money but I could still eat like the King of the Peasants awash in my wealth of cheaply priced tacos,we are broke and need cheap tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also when my burrito was accidentally dropped on the ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You have a full staff and food is taking forever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or get charged for food i do not receive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just literally tried to go to this tacobell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After talking with one of the staff they even whipped up a Crunchwrap Surpreme with a Doritos Locos shell instead of the normal taco one,Food tasted like Taco Bell should,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She even warned me that my rolled chicken tacos just came out of the fryer ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our food order was done correctly,I was surprised and I wouldn't mind coming back here when I'm hungry for some tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tucked into the cutest corner of the mall food court,My food arrived,And the woman who called out my number and handed off my food was just as great,The food court itself has a bit too much,and it was truly delicious, neon for my own taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited another 4 minutes to get food while girl was st,Hard tacos were all cracked in half and other food was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of their employees put a disgusting rock-like substance in both my husband and I food,I returned the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my food ,and got the wrong food,I just said to the manager just get me the right food i,I don't care if is more just like to get my food,Manager sits there and check price to charge me more ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perfectly cooked food ,and satisfying portions of food, Our carry out orders are complete no missing food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i myself would of be an asshole if i was in his shoes lol fuck all that shit but he was cool but the food was nasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mexican food ,The boyfriend has been trying to convince me about the goodness of Mexican food ,Basically a fried pita-like bread with its bread softness still maintained with the innards of a taco,++Dorito tacos with squeezed,++Chalupa chicken,beans,it will crumble but the meat inside combined with the veggie fillings compliment together well,and excessive cheese I hate so I am always ambivalent,The boyfriend has been trying to convince me about the goodness of and dissprove my taste aversion,,,,,,,,,,,
Just your typical Taco Bell in case you were in the Cambridgeside Galleria food court ,and were craving Mexican food,especially if its for crunchy tacos as they are one of the very few,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but waiting to pay and receive food took an eternity,but would consistently joke around and fuss with the food prep,We then had to wait an additional 15 minutes at the window just to get our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am an avid taco bell goer and opening my bag and having my tacos covering the rest of my food was more than disappointing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stick with a crunchy or soft taco ,Trying to order something with more ingredients seems to be difficult,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we ordered some food thru the drive thru , The food is good, Do they not even consider that the amount the food cost was not their fall from grace, Not some god damned coupon for free food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A vegetarian's food would never be treated so disrespectfully,I spend more time picking out bits of white and orange cheese than I actually spend eating my tacos,Place the fresco tomato/onion/cilantro mix away from the cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And sleep would explain how that cheesy potato burrito thing could become my fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
every single Taco Bell I ever been to (which has been very few) has given me cold food that looks ,and tastes like dog shit wrapped up in paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mediocre food,"unmelted cheese over ""COLD"" meat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to drive thru people trying to ""make a deal"" for leftover chicken at closing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The manager was very nice and he replaced my entire order when the box split open and tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I mean I get a like 20 cent charge for the cup but full price for a water,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I hate it when you leave and drive away just to open the bag with food to find they made a mistake with the order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and enough food to take for lunch the next,80 for a chalupa combo with chicken,and I'd get free chips and salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If im getting food even if it cost a dollar  you should  get the best  service  ,and they dont do that in this  taco bel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took me about 17 minutes to get 1 burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never put enough nacho cheese in their burritos,Especially the breakfast burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Of course I wouldn't eat this all the time but the food was pretty good,Full of flavor and very soft burritos,The quesarito was delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I swear I thought I saw Rod Serling standing by the register and THE 'IT"" clowns in the burrito-taco assembly line",40 cents for less effort and more ingredients saved for them for no flatbread and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll actually review the restaurant and the food, The food has always been correct,and tasted like Taco Bell should taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this fucking tacobell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cold food,Uncooked rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I watched the older lady that had been cooking my food grab the sauces ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they seem to be so genuinely nice that it is okay if they ask you how you are doing and how the food is 2 or 3 times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get to the window and they want to charge me for the wrong food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  They make the food as well as the next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food sloppy, and pretty much all beans ,and no meat or cheese in sight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First off I ordered a Doritos Locos Taco Supreme with other food items only to find out they never even gave me the Doritos Locos Taco,The rest of the food was horrendous,I've been to Taco Bell numerous amount of times and I know when their food is good,The food tastes like it had been sitting out for three days , taste wise,I'm kinda glad they didn't put the missing Taco in the bag as it would of probably tasted like everything else I bought,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That is what I usually order for food ,I usually order the fresco soft chicken taco or the regular,fresco taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They seem to always get our orders wrong and the food is often poorly,the food is alright,Instead I got a crunchy taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nachos were made up of all broken chips except like two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They're so skimpy with the meat/filling at this location,I got a Crunchwrap with barely any filling especially the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Get home late night only to see bag was missing 3 burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The tacos tasted pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For late night eats in Gresham where I live this is one of only a few options in my current price range,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 He said there was an order for 6 tacos,I was told it would take 10 minutes for 5 cheese roll ups,so we would need to wait 10-15 minutes for 5 cheese roll ups,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is typical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mostly because of it's proximity but also because they rarely ever mess up my order (no sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was prepared well ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i eat sooo much of it and it tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They messed up my burrito so many,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most inedible burrito that I've ever had the disgrace of putting in my mouth,I ordered a cheesy bean and rice burrito,but unwrapped it to see wth was happening with my burrito,I ripped that half of the burrito off ,So I bit into the other half of the burrito,So the rest of the burrito went into the trash as well,most inedible rice I've ever had to chew,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I was surprised that the restaurant wasn't cleaner and the food was so slow,Spicy potato soft taco was indeed spicy with plenty of warm,My husband also had a strange flavor in his taco ,the lettuce was fresh with no browning but the shredded cheese was a little,Peculiar taste to the crunch wrap supreme which is usually my favorite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On multiple occasions I have tired to go through the drive thru and the prices have been wrong," I was told that ""I know what the price says out there ",If that's is not the price change it,If you have one price ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only one problem is that at this location the prices are a little bit higher but that's OK my food is always yummy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Second burrito tasted exactly like blood, I trust my taste buds enough to know ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is made like no one cares,chips are stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Me and my friend have come here at 1 in the morning after our drink fest to come eat some good food ,The burritos,the steak quesadillas and my goodness the shredded chicken smothered burrito h,Between the steak soft tacos,the Doritos tacos which blew my mind because I love Doritos,Who would of thought Taco Bell would come out with a taco shell made of delicious,this new damn new naked chicken Chalupa, chicken breast smh,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was ordinary,food from Taco Bell,He got the cinnamon twists and they tasted like the oil it was cooked in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got pickup tonight and food was typical,Taco Bell food-no problem there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was fast ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
counterfeit Mexican food,10 min less than a half hour is how long it took for the one (1) Doritos Locos taco to rocket thru my lower intestine in a fury of liquid hell, This unholy concoction of MSG and unidentified meat managed to turn 79 cents into a gastrointestinal,but actually delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered fresco tacos,What I received were tacos with frozen,There was also a very tiny beat of meat in the tacos, salsa/vegetables on top-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also the food is very fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the crunchy taco looks pathetic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just like every other food place in northern,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only waited a few minutes but I threw away my entire lunch (two tacos & a potato griller) because the sour, cream tasted disgusting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we made good food,A really hit n miss on service and quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the food is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to missing ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I placed my order online and waited patiently for the food to be prepared,she pulled out more order of now-cold-tacos ,My tacos were cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been waiting for my food for over 15 minutes so far ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What ever you do NEVER use a delivery service to deliver your food,We've tried 2 different food delivery services , They are always having problems: missing ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got my usual junk food splurge ,and five layer burrito with a Sierra Mist,crunchy taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Screwed up order completely and was missing 4 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food for a great,I even take some sauce packets home sometimes and add it to my homemade mexican food,Be prepared that the food court can get quite busy,I usually pair this with a soft taco , price,You can sub beans instead of beef for everything if you are vegetarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered 6 ($1) nacho tacos,3 chicken tacos,I reminded him that there were 6 $1 tacos in this order,Which contained ONLY the 6 $1 tacos,or any chicken tacos,Corrected the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wasn't even a super busy time and it took over 45 minutes to get the three items of food I ordered,and a burrito,a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As I was waiting on my food I could hear multiple,"My food finally came out in which he called ""Big",I took my food to a table nearby to check it,Took my food home hoping to enjoy something I was really craving,No the food was TERRIBLE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"or ""maybe just a little tiny bit of sauce on my burrito",and my tacos are always well-loaded,I usually get my nachos without tiny broken chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shredded lettuce and sour cream are always cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Constantly items missing from orders and then give attitudes when mentioned about food I paid for,no nacho cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While the food isn't anything to write home about,it's good and fast Mexican inspired food,While the quality of food here isn't great,t expect it to be gourmet quality food,The price is reasonable,Their Mexican pizza is also tasty and loaded with beef and beans,This Taco Bell is right off the corner of 181st ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20 mins for food in the drive thru is unacceptable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And my food was wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my food ,so I brought it all back down and asked them for the food ,and if they can remake all of the food since it is now cold,then they just tossed me my food on the counter ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got two frito burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and they legit don't know how to make the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am not quite sure why it takes an hour to get your food here every time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When people in the 90s got tacos it was around 50 cents a taco ,and now it's over $1 for the same taco with no difference,I ask for no lettuce on my soft tacos ,Is it that hard not to put lettuce on a taco,and 2 out of 3 times they put lettuce on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a chicken burrito with regular,So I go back in and let them know I get my new burrito ,I ordered 4 tacos only got 2,You guys suck and I wasted 22$ on garbage my tacos looked flat, chicken instead of the shredded,Absolutely no meat barley any cheese or lettuce disgusting , and when I looked inside it was shredded and they put not sour cream on my nacho,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Liquid cheese is a gift from above and to incorporate into a bean burrito with rice,Throw in a soft taco ,Be it the taste of the re-fried beans or in the case of today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was typical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All the food was yummy,The combo comes with 2 plus an extra taco,I think what makes it so good is the sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stopped in just for cheese fries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe I have to come weekends when the manager is in and the food is perfect,Anyways here's another picture of my girlfriend food,My Grande burrito,Was Extra small burrito it was tortilla ,She said that's how the burrito is ,You can tell it's only lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was 11:16 and we asked for a soft taco with black,They said they stop selling black beans at 11 pm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tortilla chips sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then never added the jalapeños to a burrito that was ordered ,the other two burritos were barely like,and in addition it was a complete mess not even wrapped all the way with beans ,Came by around 930 the other night it had lots of new people working obviously still in trani and got my order taken properly but given the wrong items and meat on a vegetarian,and cheese falling out of both ends,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just got off of work after a long day and the guy took my order/gave me my food said not a word to be at the window ,got comfortable and was ready to eat my food ,I gave two star because although their food is GREATLY MADE,the errors unfortunately outweigh the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I received my food there was no napkins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If u want to wait 56 minutes for food,me along with the whole restaurant waited hour+ for food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chalupa only had vegetable and the tacos not good,visit this taco bell and everything was sold out and I bought a party pack and a chalupa the chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 30 minutes to make it 5 cars to order then 10 minutes to get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito was COLD,I ordered nacho fries and they couldn't AT LEAST fill the little cup halfway with cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are sloppily made,just full of rice,The cheesy fiesta potato bowls are always hard ,barely any meat,and taste old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ugh) As I type this review all three of us who ate the food at this location have nausea,How on earth did an employee not notice a bug this large inside their food during prep,It looked like it hadn't been dead for very long and was missing some legs (which I assume are lodged somewhere in the unfinished taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I only ordered three dollars with the food ,I came through and ordered a soft taco ,The soft taco meat was weird,Overall the nacho fries were OK despite the fact that they were super seasoned and kind of salty but the taco was just gross,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very disappointed however McDonald's around the corner is open,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the worker half ass their food,The way that they are handing out their food does not come up to food code regulation therefore should not be given to customers,the manager need to do their job and fire the workers that don't do their job and hands out shitty contaminated food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would suggest playing one of those food games on your phone to learn how to get multiple,Getting this review now as I am waiting at the window still waiting for my food watching three of the employees staring at a monitor trying to figure out what's going o,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but if you pay for food,you expect to receive the food you pay for,take the time to check your food in front of fast,food window so they can fix it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  food was ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As I ordered my food,the same lady(holding the broom) went to make my food,I had asked if she changed her gloves before making my food because I saw her holding the broom,would she have liked for me to make her food ,this is the food industry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoyed my food ,Foods were delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They always get my order right and the food always tastes delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I received hot food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not to mention my food was cold,but It also took 20 minutes for two burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After waiting 20 minutes to order my food ,I get home to find  beans on my food,Whether someone is eliminating a food because they don't like it or because they have FOOD ALLERGIES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let our true Mexican brothers and sisters work there bet you it will be great then and tasty delicious food much,Never any meat in my order of tocos always just lettuce cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mid day and ordered 4 tacos & a cinnamon,The cinnamon twist was never included in the bag although I was charged for it & one of the tacos wasn't even wrapped ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got my Mexican pizza with no meat and a bean burrito with sour,This is been my staple along with the taco salad for many,And it's a new location right on the corner of Osceola Parkway ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited 25 minutes after placing a mobile order only to find out my food was sitting on the counter waiting for it to be brought to me the entire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our food has been smashed,and the special items without onions were not labeled so eating the food is an  allergic,The food was hot,since I don't appreciate people accusing us of lying about missing items and that all the food was mixed,Our no onions burritos were in a SEPARATE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is usually good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I jumped out to get inside before they closed to use the restroom and get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sat in the drive thur for over 30 mins todays then when I finally pull up to the monitor to place my order I had to say hello 2-3 times to get a response and the cashier at the window I could see her through the drive-through and she was basically in the back doing something long story short you can go to Chick-fil-A across the street which has twice the line and get your food in 5 to 7 minutes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  Ordered 2 bean and cheese burritos , They decided it needed rice, I hate rice, You either enjoy rice or you don't,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is never not prepared,but some of them care more about talking to each other and if you mention that you haven't gotten your food yet-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Im a busy student so i need food fast ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do not need to take fiber supplements when I go on a late night food binge ,It's like a Russian Roulette with you but I do appreciate the fake cheese ,and sour cream that you always put on your Quesoritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bad attitude i dont know how many times my food was wrong, missing things or tasted nasty they honestly dont care about there customers at all the employee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Charged me for a steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You'd think as the cost of fast food have raised over there years that there quality of the food would also get better ,but they skimp on the amount of chicken they put into the tacos I get the chalupas ,and there's never enough chicken in them it's disappointing,really would it hurt to add a little more meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I have been there the food is cold,I believe they don't fully cook any of food,French fries taste so bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took a long time to get our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get handed my bag of food with an attitude ,I ordered a chalupa meal and asked them to change the chicken to beef ,I check it again when I drove off and now they put chicken,I told her what happened she rudely answers well a chalupa meal is chicken ,and I said yes ma'am that's why I asked the first time for ground beef instead of chicken ,and I leave and open the bag and they put refried beans instead of ground beef,and second time when I came around I explained they put refried beans instead of GROUND BEEF,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it takes them FOREVER to prepare a couple of tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The first time we went they were out of mild sauce hot sauce Baja blast and various tacos,A word to anyone else wanting a taco from a Taco Bell go to one that isn't out of tacos, This last time all they had was only steak options,"they literally said as soon as we got to the order menu ""we only take cash right now and we only have steak left"" only steak",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food's Taco Bell,1) I've had a couple of occurrences where the price I have been charged has not matched the price on their menu board,and they were not supportive when I asked them to use the menu board price,plus scummy as they should honor their advertised price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 times I've ordered a number 2 with a soft taco ,3 times I've gotten a crunchy taco with ice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Crap food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the floors are covered with food ,3) watched them burn several peoples food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoyed my food at this restaurant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What lies at the deepest point of a taco from Taco Bell is a unification of mild,shredded light cheese,sour cream ,and shredded lettuce for an unmatched,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and we ordered 4 cheesy Gordita crunches and 2 soft taco supremes,my 2 soft tacos had been placed in the bottom of the bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,They tasted like cardboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered two soft tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But my chicken rolled tacos were freezing,ordered a 12 pack of tacos they were all out together like crap taco toppings not even on the tacos ordered 2 mini quesadilla ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The girl at the window handing me the food seemed like she had an attitude with ME,I waited another 5 minutes after I paid and the tacos were cold,I wanted a Taco salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can never eat a Taco Bell crunchy taco again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just went to get a few tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get home realize half of our food is missing ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was comped,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We told her we were going to take the food to go instead,As we waited for our food,drops our food bag onto the counter ,BOTTOM LINE: Not only will I not ever step foot in this Taco Bell again because of the horrible treatment and subpar food we received,My mom said her chalupas had no meat either,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came by around 930 the other night it had lots of new people working obviously still in training and got my order taken properly but given the wrong items and meat on a vegetarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seems to be a gamble on if you will have a bag of great food or if it will be a huge,I really appreciate them labeling the burrito supreme so there are no shocking surprises for the one that doesn't like sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a chicken soft taco supreme only to get a normal, one with 4 pieces of chicken thrown on top,I also ordered two chicken quesadillas with sour, cream on the side and got them with the sour cream on them,The final straw was finding a PUBIC HAIR in my side of sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what am I supposed to my food with,I ordered a smothered burrito - unbelievable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got my food at 6:20,And then when I finally got my food I was given the wrong,Almost an hour of waiting for 3 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's not much to evaluate when it comes to a standard fast-food place,Both tasted awesome and consistent with what I expected and I got my food quickly,I tried the new quesalupa and a chicken quesidilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got my usual junk food splurge ,and five layer burrito with a Sierra Mist,crunchy taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a metal skrew in my breakfast burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Taco Bell workers need to be retrained on everything from the food to the customer service aspect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now almost 15 minutes later with no line in store or drive thru they still don't have my food don,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you have 30 minutes to wait for drunk food,Took 20 minutes to order and another 10 for the actual food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered 2 burritos bean only - no cheese, Got home not only were the burritos wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" By ""McDonaldizing"" I mean taking some type of food ",if I feel like real mexican food,For example -  McDonald's doesn't really taste like a typical cheeseburger,it's still Taco Bell and it's still delicious,and making it into its own brand (which tastes nothing like the typical,but moreso it just tastes like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came to get some food through the drive thru,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I wanted to purchase the shredded chicken quesadilla melt on their value menu as a simple,I found out that Taco Bell has announced that they are discontinuing all of their shredded chicken menu items on November 5," This location is ahead of the curve by showing ""out of stock"" stickers covering the names of all of the shredded chicken items on their drive-thru",As someone who has always enjoyed their shredded chicken menu items,I decided to get the traditional chicken quesadilla instead, While it's not as good or as inexpensive as the shredded chicken melt,it was served warm with lots of chicken ,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,
my food is wrong,the food being put together her attitude,the tacos are never filled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the order is wrong and the food is cold,What I don't expect is the incompetent workers who get my order wrong and serve me cold food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she immediately pulled it down and glared while she handed us our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No beans on burrito add, I get cinna twist and a burrito with rice ,Number 2 chicken burrito,Tempted to take that bean burrito back ,How it get sour cream on the taco,I get beef with rice,Just add rice,and ALL beans,I'm allergic to beans, guacamole,,,,,,,,,,
It's extremely sad when you go through the drive thru and they aren't busy at all and all I ordered was a 7-layer and bean burrito ,and a burrito supreme ,I got a bean and rice burrito ,and a 5 layer burrito ,and burrito surpreme,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was correct,However the from the time I pulled up to the speaker to the time I got my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After speaking with the manager she told me that they couldn't refund me or anything because we got the food,""" And she FINALLY said ""I could give you a coupon for a free taco""","If you have ""apology coupons"" for free tacos","Please accept these coupons for free tacos for the inconvenience while we fix your order"" It's called CUSTOMER SERVICE people",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you're expecting gourmet food, Taco Bells are known for coming up with inexpensive fast quasi-Mexican food, While we were waiting for our food to be served,"""I love Taco Bell food",but you can't get that food in Mexico,but he was also serious about loving the food too,Carlos decided to take me to one of the best taco restaurants in Mexico,I like Taco Bell's basic three crunchy tacos, And the tacos still taste the same, The three crunchy tacos,with the indescript meat that is easily recognizable,crisp shredded lettuce and shredded orange colored cheese tossed on top of the rest of the ingredients like they were trying to hide something (most likely the indescript  meat), Crunchy hard corn tortillas,,,,,,,
Like any tacobell this place is better during the day time ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My boyfriend and I came to this location for food we ordered the following:,2 burritos with no onions,When we got our order we started with the Crunchwrap one of them was supposed to not have tomato in it but both of them did in addition the burritos had onions on them which we asked them not to add onions,3 tacos,2 chicken quesadilla ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burrito was mostly sour,Chalupa had almost no meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We had to pull forward while we waited on our food,For waiting on our food,So we had lukewarm food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just had the worst food I've ever gotten from any Taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Like the one in Swanee - I paid for double meat - ,is because some dont put ANY meat in them no matter how much you pay - like the one at 5201 Memorial Drive,even if I pay for double meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I then bit into my food which was hot,After eating my food, I went back to order more food just to get the receipt,Second time around they were just as kind and my food was cooked to perfection,This was the best tacobell experience i have had in months,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was one person working the counter and making all the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this time my favorite was the baja blast & the doritos locos taco,thank you taco bel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our food has been smashed,and the special items without onions were not labeled so eating thee food is an  allergic,The food was hot,since I don't appreciate people accusing us of lying about missing items and that all the food was mixed,It was loud in there and the food was not that good,Our no onions burritos were in a SEPARATE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are have the same ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Asked for no sour cream in the burrito,well got sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a bean chalupa and when I was about to eat it the beans were warm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast food,they should change this to slow food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've had food poisoning twice in my life ,It makes you wonder how many corners they cut when it comes to cleanliness and proper food h,I noticed they cut corners ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good Staff at the counters however the wait was long for the quality delivered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Yummy food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good location  ok food,Good prices,Nice to be located near a Target and steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for food that vaguely reminds you of Mexican cuisine,For $5 you can fill your belly with a good amount of food, The Meximelt could be considered a rolled up cheese quesadilla with that special mexican meat-like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food great,very clean good experience nicely priced budget food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the food is good,Its on a corner of the main,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was okay,The hard shell taco was better than the chicken,Mainly because the quesadilla was messy and a bit too spicy for my taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was ready,It's barely food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bland food,They need management to step in and properly oversee service and food quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was supposed to get supreme tacos ,but received regular tacos instead,Well it wouldn't have been if the tacos had not been soaking wet,they had water inside the tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked to sub beans to my order ,"and they ADDED beans on top of the meat after I said ""no meat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if I ever get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Especially since I only came to try the nacho cheese fries,But for 1 dollar (yes 1 dollar) you get a container of fries and some hot gooey nacho cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It didn't have enough of that cheese stuff,However it still tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They then gave me a cold burrito with meat on after I specifically asked for no meat because I am a vegetarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the few places that offer a value menu with delicious items,it is just a chain operation but quality has been consistently good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Where else can you be exposed to contaminated food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And then the food was HORRIBLE,I just make tacos,see attached picture if the most pathetic taco ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,Every single table had food remnants on them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have noticed that this restaurant has improved over large amounts of time but was a little worst now taco Bell is doing a spectacular job also the food is amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A conservative estimate would be 25 minutes from the time I walked in the doors to the time I was walking out of the doors with two burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They took a while getting the food out to the drive thru which I'm usually okay with,But when I got home the food was not made well,we got beefed five layers one without sour cream one without meat entirely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's not enough employee s working there they need more people the service is super slow there's only one employee doing the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm a sucker for the steak gorditas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great for late night food that you'll regret by morning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I like Taco Bell food well enough,but GOD DAMN IT this is Portland and my unrealistically optimistic ass wants to believe that even shitty fast-food chain restaurants can do better than this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ordered pintos and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Been to this location twice and had delicious food,However the service was friendly and the food was very yummy,They also made a slight error when executing one of the orders replacing the crunchy taco in the big box meal with another burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(pic included) When I took the food back to the counter,I gave them one star at this location due to the under filled tacos,He then said that I must have ordered it with no lettuce,You can see some lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
waited in line for my food about 15 minutes with about 5 cars in front of me before driving off for a few,i had time stamps from my phone indicating i literally spent just about an hour getting some shitty food that i really shouldn't even have been eating to begin with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When in the mood for Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then I finally received my food ,It literally looked like someone sprinkled meat in the center ,I had shell lettuce and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got the Doritos taco,Taco was stale as ever like it was left out for a while then my chicken Quis was just nasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 After a long session of pumping iron - I like to down a dozen tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
processed cheese wiz,and a big gob of sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food service,the food mi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is st,at 18 minutes) for my food in the late,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I should not have to do that every time I want a burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On the rare occasions I've actually gotten my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I come here all time service is pretty good the foods always how I want it I never have any extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is really good, Takes approximately 10 minutes to get your food every time ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What on earth takes this long to make a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chicken burrito supremes ,chicken gorditas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When we finally got the food,we were 1 taco short,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the restaurant was not closed therefore they should still have the food that you would like to eat right,It is so frustrating to us when we go somewhere and they are out of the food or don't want to melt the cheese so that they can make our food,Well I was able to get my soft tacos with no problem,He then asked for something else with steak,however my boyfriend wanted to order nachos and she stated that they did not have any cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 and the food is spot on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Prepare to be ripped off because the food you paid for will not be in your bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think the food is good,I ordered a couple taco supremes,I get home and realize that they are not taco supremes,they are regular tacos,but I did end up with four tacos for the price of two,She just grabs a taco ,Doesn't really taste like the Doritos thank goodness,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service was ok and I only ordered a bean burrito,my bean burrito was real,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should be noted the double decker taco is pretty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food is always consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not really real mexican food,"This is pretty much the only big chain ""fast-food"" I will eat",I have no idea why they have the crazy 2 window system (pay at the first and get food at the second,I keep it really simple and order a couple bean burritos (with green,They really can't screw that up - discounting the one time they put like an entire handful of onions on my burrito, sauce - which makes all the difference in the world) and maybe a soft taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food from this location is pretty,I got a regular taco in place of a volcano taco -- and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've gone through a couple times lately and I have to repeat myself multiple times and even have to point out what's on the menu and explain what is in the taco to the person,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the staff is usually very polite and the food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All in all Taco Bell is what it is and I will continue to go back cause it's cheap and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 why does it take over10 minutes to get my food here ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 weeks ago i went to this location and ordered a nachos bell grande chicken soft taco w sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have come to this particular Taco Bell time and time again and they've been open but not serve food because the store manager didn't show up,The food that they put together is not like the pictures,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Then he went to the back and tried to yell a new order at them to make a fresh taco pizza,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you pretty much know what to expect from Taco ""Hell"" in terms of food quality",I might feel bad about eating the food afterward,and price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice and friendly and the food was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
out of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 But the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food wasn't assembled properly with meat on one side ,and veggies on another tasted like crap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when I finally get my food,and sometimes you really just want a burrito,I pulled out an ice cold burrito, But the unsolicited case of recently refrigerated sauces changed the whole ecosystem of the bag leaving us with a mess of congealed cheeses ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 All of our food looked great, and tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And our food was awful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was near closing time but we had 10 minutes left to order our food using the drive-thru,you could easily hear the same guy in the back raising his voice about having to make our food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I don't want to touch the sink with my hands then touching my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Same normal chips cheesy goodness ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food at this one is pretty,I went to the drive through to get a couple of tacos for lunch,I'll go back because sometimes you need a cheap but tolerable taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would say it's worth it to get some food late,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No cheap Mexican food is worth the pain in the ass that this place is,Oh and don't you dare ask for some damn salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Between five of us ordering not one of us got the food we actually ordered,One of us got a taco that was completely cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is cheap,I don't think I've ever had a problem at this Taco Bell the staff is always friendly and they get the food out quick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not going to accuse them of evenly spreading the ingredients out or making it with excess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the worker's kids were playing in the restaurant by throwing and hitting a taco sauce packet against the wall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It gets better: when I got the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I say no beans ,and it has beans or its just missing all together ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and food is horrible,the staff works hard to be friendly and the food somehow just tastes so much,they take forever to get me my food (wait an average,The food here just isn't worth,The Doritos Locos Taco Supremes are always low on meat and the soft tacos are hard,I miss the other Taco bell soft tacos with the meat so hot,this place gives you small amounts of meat , its so delicious,I thought all Taco Bells taste the same,I still do not get how this Taco Bell's taste is not good,Why does this location lack so much with service and taste,,,,,,,,,
I've never had a problem with the food at this KFC/Taco Bell,I won't stop going here because the food is consistent,but the main reason I ever patronize this one is that the prices of every other,Taco Bell in a 10 mile radius has jacked their prices ridiculously, and the aforesaid prices are good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Coffee was steamy hot and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you are looking for cheap food that you will regret later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My weakness - bean burritos ordered fresco,Another option is the 7 layer burrito,ordered 86 the cheese & guacamole (which isn't vegan,They 86 the cheese & add a pico,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a number 10 which was 2 crunchy tacos chzy gord crunch ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- Positives: Taco Bell is definitely my go to munchie food,Fav Item: Fresco bean burrito & Baja Blast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I threw this food out since it wasn't worth,But When I'm in the drive through I still don't want to see workers chomping on tacos with their mouths open,Taco Bell is all the same ingredients mixed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food is taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You get a decent amount of cheese on your taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best cheap lunch- small drink & two soft tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight I ordered at 6:39 and it is now 7:09 and I have no food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered chicken got beef,Is it really that hard to tell chicken from beef,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sometimes before even leaving and the bathroom was so dirty that you would never use it ordinarily but this has become an emergency thanks sickness you now feel from the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food tastes worse ,prices go up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food I receive is stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is the closest Taco Bell and now we have tried to go three different times and left each time with no food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the morning time the food is good,But there evening crew needs some help always out of rice cheese just the basic,i have asked them without the beef but thy both had beef in them so i dont know how hard is it to listen for the ingredient ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Update: ordered supreme tacos,received standard tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll prefect this by saying the food is usually decent,I don't know if it's just terrible management (which is very likely) but this location seems as if it's ran by children with zero knowledge of food service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sometimes the food isn't as fresh,One night my shell was hard and Mexican rice wasn't nearly as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is pretty much,burritos ,There are three places along Avalon Park Blvd to get tacos - Taco Bell,"are the ""volcano"" selections: tacos",add in (and charge me for) extra items (3 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The seating area is filthy and covered in food(we didn't see until after ordering) 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Of course its not 5 star good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and food was what I expected,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delicious quesadilla ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and get a box of tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Currently waited in line to order for 20 mins then got past the ordering and waited another 20 mins to get our food terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our food is all cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I don't even really care that their food is often made sloppily ,Almost immediately after finishing my food, I've never gotten flu-y from food before ,No cheese in a cheesy rice and bean burrito),and often doesn't have the all of the ingredients mentioned in a product (eg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Drunk food,stoner food,but for the price ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's your regular great taco bell food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the burritos are full,The taco are stuffed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I frequent this location and it seems they get my order right only 50% of the time or my food is a mess ,Tonight my food was cold,I asked for no tomatoes but there was a lot of tomatoes on my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They used to have Baja Sauce for the chalupas and now just stinky sour cream what's the deal with that Taco Bell you used to be cool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is usually good,Good price,The management should be hounding the employees to increase speed quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but my kids insisted on having tacos for lunch,we ordered a taco party pack ,and received tortillas full of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I order the grande meal taco pack I always get tacos, with very little meat inside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It reminds me of when I make taco salad ,and use nacho cheese Dorito's for the chips,They offer a nacho cheese , The nacho cheese Dorito one is the best to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went into the dining room to get food to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At least their prices reflect their quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Took a total of 30 minutes to receive my food,I could have made my own bean burrito in that time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By the time i got home I had to go somewhere else to get food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was fresh,so I don't know if that makes a difference in service and food quality or not,order my taco,"""one doritos locos taco please"" ""yes",I ate the taco as I drove back  down,and the cardboard wrapping for the taco was nice,b/c it kept the taco neat ,I went again the next day and ordered the regular crunch taco (99 cents) ,and the doritos locos taco (1,a taco bell taco is definitely much,to my surprise the tacos were good,price is good,(Not much difference in taste btw,I think they might be taking the advice of their customers and making the items fresh b/c everything did taste quite fresh,,,,,,
cheese shreds were still in their solid,we expect the Meximelts to have melted cheese, Meximelts were full of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I tried one of their new egg wraps and 2 hard shell chicken tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the person on intercom said that I could substitute steak or chicken so I placed my order for 3 tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were short staffed and the food was excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are constantly out of key ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I should've read the Yelp review before I got in line to literally the slowest ""fast"" food restaurant ever",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I live around the corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As for the food,and minus a star because they forgot one of our burritos,And no beans,but no meat,my meatless/beanless chalupas had like,all i want is the lettuce and tomatoes and cheese ,maybe 7 shreds of lettuce inside,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and you still can't remember that cheese goes on a taco,that I ordered a ranchero taco,lettuce,go on the salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not only did the manager get an attitude but he proceeds to tell us ""remember when you're at a restaurant we have control over your food ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and this time my bean burritos came with onions after I specifically left instructions for them to be left off due,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have the best nachos and the most awesome burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Based on the food - this would have been a 3 star rating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
out of cheese,The 3-cheese blend missing chapula did hit the cravings spot ,the spot reserved for the 3 types of cheeses i was so wanting,I need you guys to have all the ingredients on those 4 days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you request a special order like no tomato or sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The employees were unfathomably rude and the food took way to long to cook,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FRESH salsa bar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food comes out relatively quickly, The food here is your typical,Taco Bell food: it's awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never get our food right ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
leaving one of my friends with just one out of three tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food isn't up to par,the bean burritos were on old, hard flour tortillas and hardly had any beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they frequently leave food out of your order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first time I came they took 15 minutes to get me my food ,and I had to return it because on my crunch wrap the meat was sparse ,Just went through again and had even less meat this time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food is tasty and some times if we are not happy with the food we got,Good staff excellent food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I expected this because rarely does any food item look like it's picture in a menu,usually either chicken,or beans,or steak with either soft,cheese,sour cream,different variations of lettuce,"most of their ""specials"" just use their same everyday ingredients in different",,,,,,,,,,,,
They messed our entire order up the first time and then the second time the food we got was terrible,Five crunchy tacos and four bean burritos shouldn't take ten minutes to get ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't get the pico or guac that I was charged for in my taco salad,Manager very unapologetic and unprofessional about the wait and had sour cream all over her forearm ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Like taco shells,No tacos at the Taco Bell tonight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just wanted 4 fucking tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the worse taco Bell I've ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took nearly 30 minutes for my friend to get her food ,and all she ordered was 2 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You'd probably get faster food driving to the Polaris location ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's the type of woman that people throw the tacos back through the window to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was your typical Taco Bell food,beans instead of meat,I think everyone knows Taco Bell meat is some of the sketchiest fast,food meat out there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There have been many times where they are very close to closing but they always seem to let me order my food ,It's a given everything comes out of a bag but as long as it taste good and looks good that's all I care about when eating my 10 tacos in one sitting,and it never really seems to taste that old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm just as happy as I would have been if I got the food I originally asked for because of the great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food has often been a little,The last three times in a row that I have been there the drive through has been 15 minutes plus to get food,The food quality has dropped again (it sort of goes up ,I know what the food is supposed to taste like,it is up to management to adequately staff and train the food prep crew,I can get served faster in any of the sit down Mexican restaurants around here and get better food,The food is the food,The service was so good I kept coming and it has been over a year since I've had any food quality issues,Fast food is normally thankless,but bad enough that on my last three orders I haven't finished one of the bean burritos I've ordered,In some cases I have thrown full burritos away because the first,and down here from my experience over the years) the beans taste bad,For a while there was an issue with the beans not being cooked right so some were crunchy,I have been coming here for years and the quality of people has been the constant that keeps me coming back ,,,,,,
The food seemed fresh,The diablo sauce tasted really good,like ghost peppers hot sauce i tasted in Panama City Beach,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would NOT order our food the way we asked (he basically ordered for us,) I ordered my usual crunchy taco fresco,The meat was so drenched in orange oil it dripped continuously,the lettuce was limp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And by the time I get my food it's usually assembled very carelessly,Please get new staff or a new manager or something because it is the only drive through Taco Bell near me and I still enjoy the food in general,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as I was leaving I noticed my food was made incorrectly & also,half wrapped) I traveled back to this location went inside asked for my meal remade & at this point - the 'manager' Dakota sets off the worst attitude denying my food was incorrect,- opening it up with his hands flinging food around &  asking what I expected from him,you don't have a right to throw the food I paid for away regardless-- the best part from all of this,pulls the food out to GIVE BACK TO ME & ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not quite mexican food,More like quik tacos or burritos,Its a tacobell,But is it real meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is still the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I want food ,) Something something I only paid $5 for three different food items ,They did not put lettuce on any of my food,nasty little shred of iceberg lettuce in any of my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well that wasn't the case after getting home and seeing that the cheese wasn't even melted just pissed me off how are you going to give someone raw food,"The manager said he can only do one thing either redo my food or give me my money back since it's against ""company policy""",I told him no you're gonna make my food again this time hot,cause that's not my fault you guys couldnt double check before giving out raw food ,I got my money and my food after all the dam employees kept looking at me like how about doing your job instead of looking to the lobby to see who's there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food,I ordered a bean burrito ,I roll up and ask for another burrito,the guy looks a little exhausted to be honest but he made my burrito ,the burritos were decent,looked more like a blob of cheese smacked onto broken chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We had to drive back around for the missing items and wait in line again for the items (there were no customers in the restaurant at all- the two other employees in there who were wiping tables could have easily brought us our food),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Classic Taco Bell food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the rattlesnake burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco Bell food was made to order ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When we got home to eat our food was all wrong,My husband ordered no lettuce on all of his food,My burrito supreme had beans on it ,but I ordered it without beans,Everything we ordered had so little meat--it was ridiculous,It ALL had lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How hard is it to put the freaking tortilla filled with cheese on the surface of the industrial,sized Foreman Grill and close the lid AND leave it there long enough to melt said cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is the third time we have stopped here and they have ""been out of meat""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But When I'm in the drive through I still don't want to see workers chomping on tacos with their mouths open,Taco Bell is all the same ingredients mixed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but who cares) and are now hastily churning out food that is fit,but sometimes you just need a couple tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Beef Meximelts were sufficiently heated (so that the cheese melted) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My tacos were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To not apologize or offer to give us our food for free,) to get three tacos and two burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is what you expect from Taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I received my food thrown in a bag ,I was in the mood for some tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Took them 4 tries to get 1 burrito right,the manager was the one screwing up the burrito,the guest sitting next to us had to send their burrito back 4 times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco Bell in general is a joke when it comes to Mexican food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Has to be the slowest ""fast"" food service in Lake Mary",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they somehow made a chicken Catina burrito instead,I order a chicken cantina bowl,I order a chicken cantina bowl , and the guy who made it didn't even add the cheese and the guacamole,You have the ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The editors acknowledged that Taco Bell's innovations in burrito-folding supremely enhanced the dishes they made,I moved on to tacos,I bit into a 'meat' taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The last trip I ordered a crunch wrap supreme and there was maybe one bite of the whole wrap that actually had meat in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the meat taste really flavorful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I love their Baja steak Chalupas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The floor has food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got my food fairly quick,The food wasn't special,I got a cantina bowl and two burritos ,and instead of putting the burritos in a separate,container they laid the burritos on top of the cantina bowl where all the beans were so the burritos got soggy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The soda tastes musty like they don't clean the machine ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you get average food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
affordable Mexican food that allows me to feel like I am part of an authentic,The ingenious burrito-like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,great price,That's a price that almost nobody can beat,but now they raised their price a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I gotta say this Location has never disappointed me until tonight there was only 3 cars in front me by the time I got my food it was almost 20 minutes I noticed ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A little family time with tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Was here tonight ---it took me a total of 35 minutes from ordering til I received my food, I like the food ---,but I guess I'm just going to have to unlike ur food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got sloppy food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Takes forever to get your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is average,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and two cars in the drive thru and it took over 15 minutes to get my food,Did you know that they charge extra to switch from a crunchy taco to a soft,taco,10 up charge to get a soft taco,Today I had an odd craving for one of their chicken quesadillas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered two different types of burritos,Neither burrito had any kind of meat in them,One with chicken one with beef,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she pours $2 in pennies on my friends passenger seat to pay for her food ,Thank God for 69 cent hard shell tacos even if there's a late,"""Don't forget the extra meat",-An inside joke my friends and I have now due to a scary encounter David had here at 1:00 am when a trans-sexual woman asked my friend to order a beef challupa (extra meat,"and screams ""don't forget the extra meat",the characters that hang out on this corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The inside is DIRTY with food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We came here for breakfast and the guy who took our order was extremely nice and patient and the food was hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Eat here only if you like hair in your food ,As I ran my fork through the food,beans ,and crushed chips,Why were all my tortilla chips crushed,It's like someone took the last remnants of a bag of chips,I was upset that I couldn't use these chips to load up the dip,meat,Since TB doesn't use real cheese on nachos,I knew it wasn't stretchy cheese,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,
I wanted some rolled chicken tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DO NOT Eat here unless you have 40 to 45 Minutes to wait for your food, Every table had people sitting waiting for food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They are always extremely nice at the window and the food is always hot,so you should expect Taco Bell food, If you like Taco Bell food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Taco Bell competes with lots of fast food type places in the food court within the Florida Mall: it serves up industrially manufactured,and cheap food at its worst,This food had no discernible,It was lukewarm food too,The server was courteous and the food was presented up very quickly,no thank you - I had the soft taco option ,the sour cream was served in a tiny paper pot and priced at 59 cents was  more like plain yoghurt ,and the guacamole also at 59 cents served in a small,orangey cheese were rubbery ,I mean cheese is meant to have a taste,and completely devoid of taste, paper pot just tasted metallic,it certainly didn't have an avocado taste,,,,,,,
buy taco fixings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Usually EXTREMELY SLOW but the foods usually good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
beef burritos,volcano tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last week I had the misfourtune of ordering a taco,I go to this location a lot and let me say they price gauge like crazy,They overprice the usual,I got the nachos and after eating I found a large clump of hair at the bottom of the to go bowl it looked like someone cleaned their shower drain then put it in the nachos for extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a grande scrambler with a side of cheese ,and it was absolutely delicious for the $3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which on most occasions very delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is one of my favorite fast food options because I don't eat meat,and generally I end up with nothing more than a side of fries or a small salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got to the pay window at 6:57pm and pulled away with food at 7:07pm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that includes tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The crispy tacos are deeeee-LISH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
order my tacos ,and chalupas beef and cheese only,has sour cream on the chalupas,One has tomatoes in it and the other has some lettuce in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Would recommend to anybody who has a palate for high end Mexican food,I got the #8 which is three soft tacos (with my own, little twist of no lettuce ) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like cheap Mexican food,I ordered 3 burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got kicked out of this Taco Bell with no food on Christmas Eve because the cashier decided to have a meltdown ,so I don't know if there's time to make food for everyone in line,"plus were closed tomorrow so we arent going to prep food to throw it away""","I look at my husband in disbelief and some young kid who clearly works in the kitchen comes out and awkwardly says ""looks like there's no more food tonight"" ",Why are you so upset that you feel the need to insult a bunch of people for simply entering your place of employment and trying to buy food,I just want a couple bean burritos,He gave me a cup for a soda and as I was walking out he handed me a coupon for a free taco on my next,"""we're only serving chicken right now","and we may not have enough chicken for everyone in line"" ",,,,,,,,,,,
Not enough meat on my husband food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is correct,the people are nice- if I order something supreme it actually doesn't look like there's a tomato/sour cream embargo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I order my food ,she overcharged me for my food, I was just so ready to get my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They can be quick at getting you your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great quality food,i love the way i digest this food,peace peace grilled cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lots of food for cheap,Personally I just got for a soft taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
placed an order online and i was only instructed to come through drive through however when i arrived he refused to give me my food because i didn't tell him over the intercom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or give any sort of reassurance that the food was coming,I sat at the window for another 7 minutes waiting for my food to be ready,She handed me my food ,When I unwrapped my food it was sloppy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chicken,and nacho chips,found out about the soda and chips after I paid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you get tacos only,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've had a couple burritos poorly put together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So we waited 10 minutes for our food,We customized our food online ,so we satisfied our taco cravings ,Meximelt w guacamole ,I got a Double Decker with steak,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had the fiery dorritos taco,Also ordered chipotle chicken roll up thing,Next time i think ill try the chicken,you can order with chicken,beef or steak,Lastly ordered nachos and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got home to open up my bag and found that a lot of my taco was on the outside of the wrapper,Extremely poor customer service and quality control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's 5 minutes or I'm gone and now way will I wait a hour for food from here ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they never have black bean burritos late,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we were waiting at a table for our food for 15 minutes ,a family was mid meal and had to take their food ,"we ended up waiting 20 minutes for ""fast food"" lol disappointing even for taco bel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also a few years ago there was a credit card scam at this taco Bell (perhaps at the fault of a thieving employee if I do remember correctly) ,I typically order a cheese quesadilla ,""" A cheese quesadilla from taco bell comes with shredded",tri-blend cheese ,90% of the time I receive a horrendously burnt quesadilla with maybe 40% of the shredded cheese that should be on there scantily filling only the middle,You'd expect that with only two ingredients,how lazy must one be to forget an entire third of the ingredients of a quesadilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I honestly wouldn't give this store a star period just went less than 20 mins ago ordered 2 steak nacho plates and 2 5 layer burrito,My 2 burritos had barely no meat look like they took a baby spoon ,I called to say there was no meat in my burrito ,It was mostly cheese bean ,and sour cream very dissapointing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco Bell (at the food court) was a pretty,I wouldn't say that the staff is very good at what they do (something I've noticed about almost all the places in the food court),While I was waiting for my food,After you order your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She almost dropped the food h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pretty standard Taco Bell food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There food is great,tasting but leaves you with a bit of a  stomach ache also every time I go there for a freeze they never have it and when they do there is more ice then flavoring we my FAM is going to a different one good luck oh and I'm super angry because they took out that BLT thing  oh and there food leaves you on the potty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I said the food was good, The food is still good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as welll as our food was brought to us,90 tacos since every penny counts before our massiv roadtrip to LA,They were offering the neu chef inspired Cantina Bell menu and after having the super patient lady at the register explain the difference between the regular taco salad ,all served on a bed of cilantro rice I was sold,and the cilantro lime rice better than at Chipotle,and the new cantina bell salad with citrus-herb marinated chicken,flavorful black beans,roasted corn & pepper salsa,especially the roasted corn salsa,guacamole made from real,,,,,,,,,,
The workers could not care less about serving people their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cant make the food like it supposed to,Want sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Need to stuff burritos,Today I ordered a double stuffed burrito ,and all I tasted was tortilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"low stakes ""Mexican"" food",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Like why do I have to drive to woburn to get a Doritos locos taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they put a cheap $1 taco in the bag instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
00 worth of food,"Missing items,tacos soggy ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rude service in the drive thru and the food looked terrible,I know that the location of this Taco Bell is not in the best of neighborhoods but it should not determine the quality of the food,I ordered three soft shell taco here is what I received pictures attached,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and there was a hair in my food ,then there was also a hair in my friends food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This review is based on the assumption that everybody knows that Taco Bell is a giant fast food chain offering mediocre Americanized ""Mexican"" food",and most locations get your food out to you very quickly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another woman didn't look at me to give me my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cars were pulling away because of it and with one car in front of us it took 10 minutes to get our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco Bell always has a different cheesy taste to their foods,Not big on the smothered burrito,and it probably has to do with their recently revealed secret ingredients that they use,They state that they always use fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the drive thru line was not only slow but it was long and waiting to get your food ,Worse part is I asked for an 89 cent burrito ,and got some crap with chicken and rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Considering the other yelp reviews for this fast-food place,It took a good 8 minutes for them to make 2 soft and 2 hard tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They closed the doors 15 min early then said it would be 15 min to get order in let alone the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I stoped here on New Years Eve and ordered food ,and they screwed up the order and shorted our food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
.meat,apparently ran out of meat on christmas eve,your try explaning to your stepson that there's no meat,the lack of menu meat DID lead to a delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they ran out of mild and green sauce which are my two reasons for eating the low quality ingredients they put in a hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I received my food they were missing multiple,items and when I confronted them about it they told me I was wrong and in must represent if I want my food,"The guy that looked very intoxicated mumbled under his breathe ""shut the fuck up"" after I asked if he could give me the other food I ordered after receiving my first",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We walked in at 9:45 and got our food at 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Well Ok then I ordered 2 taco's,we do not have chips ,and we do not have lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The workers are ignorant and threw the food in the bag ,I ended up throwing the food in the trash,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We got the food right away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just went through the drive through and got the smallest soft taco ever mostly lettuce and the hard taco was the same but at least it didn't take more then 5 min to get my food lma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even when it's open the food is just a pile of crap in a tortilla,No taste you have to add the salsa just so you taste something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burrito was put together so poorly there was literally rice ,and beans falling out all over the bag,Nacho fries came basically EMPTY with no cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went here to get a bean burrito ,When I got my burrito it wasn't even half wrapped,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nobody was getting food orders in,It's not like the sky is going to fall if they forgot to grill my soft burrito,and I was informed they were out of shredded chicken,He did tell me they were out of shredded chicken which was something in my dismissed,The sign mentioned how they had run out of six listed and popular ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
crispy super tacos,my tacos were soggy,When I got home (15 minute drive) we opened the package and noticed there was less meat in the quesadillas than normal, and almost totally meatless,I actually measured the meat ,"""I can see a little meat",ing handful of meat ,non gangster employees and actually give you meat in your meal,steak quesadillas ,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos were wrapped in the wrong,Everything tasted alright though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steak Quesarito barely had any rice,I also asked for no sour cream (which I already tried to take out before the photo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cinnamon twists had no cinnamon on it and the sour cream tasted extremely expired,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You will wait 15-20 mins at a minimum for your order to be taken and your food to come out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The store was clean and the food tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most time the food tastes pretty good,I usually order the chalupa and maybe a taco as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the food isn't all that different,but they're lame things like cheese and jalapeno burritos ,and cheese quesadillas cut in half ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is usually accurate,Still haven't received my food,and tastes as Taco Bell should,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The taco I ordered wasn't even able,to be picked up and looked like a taco someone shit out ,Just make it taste good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Ordered $25 worth of his garbage food asked for a cup of ice for the bottle of water I purchased,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food came out hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the quality of food was on point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ok so I was eating a burrito ,and it started to taste funny ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two times it took 20+ minutes to get my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burritos,I went up to the counter and was simply overwhelmed by all the choices - tacos,softs tacos,cheese,sour cream,lettuce,who has impeccable taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best Mexican food in the east,Good quality food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There were 4 back packs in a corner ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went through drive thru ordered a 5 layer burrito $5 dollar box got to the window paid took 10 mins for the food got home they gave me a bean,burrito ,went inside they are going to ask me how I got a bean burrito in my box very bad,and my taco had no tomatoes like I paid for ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when we sat here for 13 minutes before our food came out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's that they don't even honor the prices that Taco Bell advertises,"try to order it and the unpleasant woman on the other end tells me ""We're a franchise and we don't honor those prices",and they don't honor their prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But Taco Bell has become a part of the American landscape and their food is something that I find myself craving from time to time (often after a night on the town),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always check your food BEFORE you leave the parking lot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bugs in food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We waited about 20 min for our food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
without food (or an acknowledgement of our existence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I let her know that sour cream isn't a condiment in my taco ,As I proceeded to order I was asked to stop my order several times and as I was telling her the modifications she asked me about sour cream which doesn't come in my item,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
incorrect and cold food,I don't even wanna taco 'bout it anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They actually know how to properly prepare their tacos and burritos ,and of course their nacho cheese fries are to die for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the beans tasted burnt,the lettuce was all wilted,why does your fryer oil taste like that,Left the most awful taste in my mouth,and the oil still tastes really bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After placing my order I had to patiently wait 20 minutes for my food to brought up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm have better options for real food near me ,convenient food got the better of me tonight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
used meat on vegetarian food,She put chicken on a vegetarian, cheese item ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You will wait 15-20 mins at a minimum for your order to be taken and your food to come out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I imagined snacking on chips ,and guacamole while waiting on my order to complete, I had such high hopes of some fast casual hybrid restaurant with a new menu and higher quality ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm glad I got some homeless people out front their food though,was starving and just wanted a couple tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered 7-Layer burrito,I don't eat meat and I had reg amt of chicken in the burrito,I got the manager and explained what I have in my burrito,I told him the burrito,I asked the lady if there was chicken in this,She replied yes it comes with chicken,I said no you already had the chicken killed,Added black beans,I also excluded sour cream and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food is wildly inconsistent,so that's probably your best chance of getting well-prepared food,The lettuce is often still frozen in the tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when was ketchup or sweet and sour such a high priced commodity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food quality is as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even threw in a coupon for a free taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and if you love junk food,The atmosphere is grim and the workers aren't always friendly but the food is why I come here, If you are starving and want to be stuffed to the gills with energy-laden caloric food then come here, I would however stay away from burritos from The Bell as they are very soupy," I recommend doing a ""mash up"" -combine Double Downs and Nashville Hot from KFC with tacos ", The Steak House Nachos are great from The Bell and KFC Double Down is a secret menu item from KFC (two pieces of fried boneless chicken with cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The other places have the burritos for 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Felt very rushed and like I was an inconvenience to them at the drive thru while TRYING to order my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not wait in line for 10+ min to get your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My boyfriend got his normal meal from this Taco Bell and got food poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The taco was nothing special,The cheese sauce on there added flavor that the taco was just lacking,We also got a side of refried beans for our daughter for 50 cents,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some of the best food atlanta has to offer,but the common yelper just doesn't understand good food like I do,Other places on yelp are triple the price ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Won't eat here anymore after they stopped selling the steak stuffed burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Did you walk up they had different station in which you could order your food on on a touch,But your food is not wrapped up in the taco Bell safer,We walked into the store immediately she didn't tell that it is not your regular taco Bell,Making a look as though you are not any regular taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the guy making my girlfriend's food (who had a couple,modifications on the Crunchwrap) got off the line to personally ask her how she wanted her food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We go to movies at the cinema close by and when we are running late but need a meal this has been the spot we go however they get the food wrong, Another 5 minutes goes by and my food is h, Gotta eat it in the fly as the movie starts in 10 minutes do we now get a bag to have our food on the go,Get in the car and I start handing out the food to discover mine has dairy ,and my ladies food is not at all what she ordered, No time to go back so the food went uneaten, Got through the drive thru with what I thought was going to be my dairy free combo burrito ,cheese ,and sour cream, Ate the bite and thought it tasted,,,,,,,,,,
I was on my break and wanted to dine in and the dining room was a mess it there was dirty tables and sticky floors and I told the staff about it and they laughed and noone came out to clean the mess but claudia was nice enough to come out and clean the dining g area and take people orders as well as mine the food was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BUT what really got me was that these people had paper plates and we're going around by themselves making plates of food for themselves,There was a huge line gathered waiting for food,I love Taco Bell and have always been happy with their food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food always comes out hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and two doritos locos tacos,What I got was a taco pizza ,and two regular tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't think I have ever gone thru the drive thru and actually gotten the right food,I have always had to go back in complain and then again wait for my food after I had already waited 10+ mins in line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food Well its normal,taco bell food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seems like they are always short staffed and the employees are always talking and chatting while 5-7 people are waiting for food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customer service was good but quality of food was yet to be admired,I ordered a buffalo fries burrito ,99 5 layer burritos better made than this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Uber driver waited forever to pick up the order because it was not ready and when I got the order the tacos were soggy,I also ordered 3 taco supremes ,and only got 3 regular tacos,It sounds petty but I paid extra for the sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steak taco meat tastes like dog food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And  then when my boyfriend brought the food out ,when we got home I found a black hair in my food,Worst taco Bell I have ever been to,but this last time I went I got soft tacos ,So we took it back and left the hair in the taco she didn't even look at it or anything she just told us that they would remake it, So we obliviously didn't want them tacos anymore so we said just give us the money back,It ruined taco Bell forever for us,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the amount of food on the floor where the workers worked was unbelievable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always good service and prices,not a franchise so quality remains more consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always good service and prices,not a franchise so quality remains more consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I work nearby and find it very annoying having to drive away for food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went in last night to grab food before heading home,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fine,The food is simply not coming out fast enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was once again hit ,I order the frito burrito ,The frito burritos had maybe a teaspoon of beef,and I know this because I order them without Fritos and no rice,no sour cream add extra nacho cheese,The nachos had almost no cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My order was missing a burrito ,and chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food came out like pig slop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am writing this because I had exceptional customer service from the guy who took my order and gave me my food today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is hot,No soggy tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poor customer I don't know who got that icky burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They served me cold stale tacos at 11am,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The floor was covered in food ,during my meal one of my guest found a hair in her food as I brought it up they said 'you ate some of it' with an attitude ,and cheese with wrappers on the floor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food sucks ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also order a chicken quesadilla with no creamy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I refused and tried to speak with the cashier but Anthony called me a thief wanting free food,I then requested that Anthony please allow me to speak with the cashier about the matter and when both the cashier and manager asked him to start with the orders he refused saying that he won't make food for them (my Son ,and I) I then requested that someone else please make my food because of the looks ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The people there are weird/fine and give 90 packets of taco sauce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered food @ 7:15 Sunday 9/9/2018,If you are trying to save on food costs you're only going to drive customers away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I probably won't go back due to all the other choices available at that food court,I had the burrito supreme,""" The counter person was nice and the burrito came up within five minutes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Drinks tend to be watered down as they prepare the drinks first and then give you your food ,You get a good value for your money and we all crave some taco bell tacos every now ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The irony of a foodie reviewing Taco Bell, Every once in a while I stop here to grab a quick bite when I'm feeling too lazy and dont feel like waiting in line at chipotle or getting out of my car to get Qdoba, Plenty of rice, Last time I had a Cantina bowl with chicken ,and chicken,beans,cheese,lettuce, I have been going to this place for many years and currently live right around the corner,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited for 24 minutes for less 5 bucks of food,Right out front of the door asking for food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered 5 regular tacos,I eat these all the time an never had this taste before it was as if someone spilled lime juice on the cheese or shells, All five had a strong line taste to them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco Bell is Americas interpretation of Mexican food , The food came out quickly ,and my order was accurate and my food was hot, I decided to try the steak one ,I really loved the steak Quesarito (check out my pic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I clearly state I'm eating food in restaurant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My other family members decided to go somewhere else to eat in the food court, I ordered my food with a friendly,getting their food,I asked the guy handing out food if mine was about to be ready,I noticed what might look like my food ,"sternly ""your food is almost ready",""" She made it clear I was getting my food", I wait another five minutes and no food,""" I told her again and she said yea this is your receipt but your food is almost ready",""" By the way another five minutes goes by and my food isn't even in a bag",I should have left there  with my food,no food ,I worked in the food industry for over 25 years,,,,,,,
 Since she didn't ask me whether I wanted crunchy or soft tacos,she gives me soft tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you come during dinner or lunch rush you can bet that the soda will taste bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also have not had any issues with food,I also enjoy the Doritos Locos tacos (nacho, cheese flavored,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am writing this as I am currently waiting on food,The food took forever,the chips are stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was the absolute worst taco bell i have ever been to we waited in drive thru for our food for over 30 mins then ,when finally getting it half of it was cold and they forgot one of our cheese roll ups so of course i told them they forgot it then while still in the drive thru about 5 mins later the lady comes to the window and says r u sure its not just in the bottom of your bag in the most snarky voice possible as i take everything out of the bag again to prove its not she just walks away without as much of an apology for making us wait or forgetting our food finally 5 mins after she walk away another employee goes ,and take our cheese roll up out of her hand throws it in a bag and rudly tosses me the bag just for us to get a cold burrito i will never go back to this location again ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but why forget to give us forks after we ordered chicken bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was delicious, and eating my shredded chicken burrito was like being in a dream (because I'm pregnant,Maurice T  is by far the best cashier I have ever had at a Taco Bell,Because of Maurice T,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unfortunately this taco bell rarely gets their order correct and the side of rice my son orders (always) routinely contains less than 1 tsp of rice in it,That makes the rice more expensive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I arrived to this location with intention of ordering food after using the restroom,""" I explained to her several times this was an emergency and I intended on ordering food after",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Took 5 minutes ornsonfor the truck in front if me and when it got to me the guy at the window wasnt familiar with my order and when I received my food despite his multiple, assurances there was steak in the burrito I opened it to find to my (non, surprise) no steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While the food I had at this Taco Bell was okay (by Taco Bell st,It consisted of my old reliable Taco Bell favorites: soft tacos ,Since the Doritos Locos tacos came out,Taco Bell's taco lineup has ballooned to over a dozen different,tacos,I still prefer the taco I loved in third,grade: soft taco with beef,The soft taco with beef comes with seasoned,"There's also a soft taco ""supreme"" option that adds diced tomatoes ","I like to add about a pack of ""fire"" sauce to each soft taco",Taco Bell's chalupa is like a soft taco on steroids,it packs a bigger punch than the regular tacos (,chicken,and cheddar cheese in a soft,three cheeses,and sour cream,shredded lettuce,This review is for the freestanding Taco Bell located at the corner of Ponce De Leon Ave NE ,,
I was excited and hungry to finally get my food,They didn't put in one of the tacos  I had ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The taco was nothing to write home about ,very delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I always ""dine in"" here and I have never had a wrong order or delay in my food",The food is MTO ,The food is also cheap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The employees just yell from the back of the counter ""we're out of food""","just ""you can't order cause we're out of food",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Absolutely ridiculous all my food was cold ,Do y'all just fill your tacos with sour,cream and no meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I should have just made tacos at home hah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service is friendly and fast here while the food quality ,I now know how bad those 3 locations have been screwing us on food quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have been reliable for years and years for a fair food for a fair,good food,price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was not good,7 Layer burrito is typically good,They did make me an alternative item after taking the 7-layer burrito back,but the rice was dry, and all the ingredients weren't added in a way where it was enjoyable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food," I got a beef burrito- menu says ""New",open taco, Prices are cheap,beans,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't normally bitch about fast food but when I get a A burrito that's pretty much,chips,and cheese in it is ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a nachos box and got taco bo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I recommend the 5 layer burrito it is so delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and well in short I ended up with food poisoning,yeah taco bell has good food ,or bad food that will mess you up for the whole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not sure if the employee's even know what a supreme taco is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited a solid 20 minutes for 3 tacos and a supreme burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I only come to this location every 6 months just to see if they can finally get my order correct and not miss any ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were so nice and food was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I drove all the way home to find out i did not have a single item in my order AS SHOWN on the receipt of food that I ORDERED,Please make sure before you package the food it is correct,I personally also work food ,Now I will have to go my 13 hour shift with no food so thank,a burrito ,I went through about 20 minutes ago and ordered 2 tacos,and chips ,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food,the one who has a radio-quality voice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cold food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70 for food items substituting meat with black,I also asked for lots of hot sauce  and was given 5 packets ten food items,So from the entire order we were able to eat 2 burritos ,beans since we are vegetarian,Instead my 6 challupas all had meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Order chicken parmigiana ,and they gave me a chicken roll up with cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They definitely don't give me enough meat on my ""meat filled"" tacos  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and food poisoning the second,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was made well,and from me walking in when the order submitted to leaving with my food was less than 10 minutes for 50 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They seem to not skimp out as badly on portions like the other locations in SE Portland and the food seems hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Get it +beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the employees have some of the best fast-food customer service I have seen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but then they stuff my food in a to go bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was of poor, quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I have been at this taco Bell multiple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food actually looks like the photos on the menu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got the spicy potato tacos ,and each taco was cold,My husbands order was a potato loaded griller where there was literally only 3 potatoes and the rest was filled with sour cream and cheese,They were filled with nothing but lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fine,The food is simply not coming out fast enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got a couple tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've always been a loyal Taco Bell customer back home in TN so I decided to try this Ohio location and was pleasantly pleased with the same consistent economical food,The flavors never have the correct taste ,and often taste like diet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited in line got to the window and they gave me my food,And our food was COLD,they forgot to give me my 2 chalupas and two nacho cheese supreme tacos,I get home and my nacho cheese supreme tacos were missing the sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I requested that all meat be substituted with refried beans,We are vegetarian and my wife has never eaten meat in her life,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They ran out of beef and we waited 40 mins for food ,The girl basically threw the food at me ,I asked for more tomatoes and sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tacos/burritos were not really filled to st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think i had two birthdays from the time i ordered my food to the time i got it ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It was nice that the cashier gave me a discount on my burrito,The burrito was just warm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is usually good, and comes with a decent amount of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food we did get upset,We ordered the Dorito tacos ,but then when we got home they were all regular flavored tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spent 40 minutes in the drive through only to get my order wrong and still had to pay full price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Absolutely ridiculous all my food was cold ,Calling the health department of food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Always hooks me up with taco sauce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I was pretty hyped for the Toasted breakfast burrito that apparently you can put Cinnabon on based on a Facebook video(https://www,The toasted breakfast burrito is not an available,You cannot request to put cinnabons inside the burrito,2 happened was because they most likely pre-made their burrito,My burrito came out way too quick,The taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that they fuck up damn near everybody's food,I want my damn food made right,I swear this damn taco hell needs to be shut down,I clearly asked for sour cream on the siiiiiiiiide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Everyone is friendly and gracious that I'm still visiting since eating Vegan foods ,"food"" feeling",and just ordering a crap ton of bean burritos, Heat your leftover burritos in the air fryer for a crispy delicous,"""better than fresh"" burrito", I haven't tried this with a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They have your food in their h,  I went to a different Taco Bell to try the new grilled cheese burrito you see advertised a lot ,nor did the burrito at this location,I also order the double shell taco with the soft,Just a mess no grilled cheese ,and loose cheese , cheese between the 2 shells for a $1,That is a new special item and I never tried it before so harder to judge but what I got was a mess and no visible cheese seen,its generally acceptable to me providing it is somewhat decent in quality ,,,,,,,,,,,
 So the food is average,especially the smothered burrito,and Steak Cantina power burrito,the fiery Doritos locos supreme taco, This quesalupa they promote so much with the cheese in the shell isnt at all like the ads,Had I not know to hunt carefully for the cheese I would have missed it,That photo of all this white gooey melted cheese, Not only that they wrap each product but somehow theres pieces of cheese,lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,
you could say that this is a miracle and you would be right :P Lick your way through the five layers that is the cheesy five layer burrito ,Your mouth will never stop watering for the cheesy taco chicken goodness that will bring you pleasure of all kinds,Indulge in the american culture that is taco ,and chicken together,and finish with a bang of extra crispy breast chicken that is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please bring back my favorite- taco salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The food is never ""spectacular",a bean burrito with green,and my wife's special bean burrito,I ordered two double decker tacos, sauce no red sauce extra onions (my wife's favorite) an enchilada and a gordita chicken (thinking crunch wrap ,sure enough on the receipt there is the churro and a gordita special order with chicken,it had sour cream on it ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a pick up order through door dash for the first time and drove to the window to pick up the food because I didn't know I was supposed to go to the speaker first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Guy who handles the cash at the front also makes the tacos in the back,prices are expensive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She said she wanted to make sure our food was correct,Fast food that was fast ,My family got a 10 pack of tacos today,Then i always order rice with cheese,I have one kid that can not eat sour cream,The lady was so nice she said it was no problem to get two without sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food took forever to come out because we were forgotten about,but when the cashier realized how long we had been waiting he got the food out as fast as he could,His food was hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only to have the bottom of her taco box blow out ,and drop all her tacos on the floor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chicken chip baskets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well the food was hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've come here at least 5 separate times & they've either messed up my order or the quality of food has been so terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chips with cheese,my drink and no chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ordered 2 of the steak double stacked nacho tacos which is supposed to have nacho,when we were given our tacos back they were beef,all i wanted was a cheesy taco, cheese in between the soft,there was no cheese whatsoever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been ordering off of the dollar menu and getting (all fresco) bean and rice burritos,potato soft taco , I'll also get a regular crunch taco fresco, style and sub black beans for the beef,which eliminates the cheese, Not once a piece of cheese or dollop of sour,sour cream,but I'd be paying for ingredients they'll just remove,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then when my food was ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unbelievably bad food cold, Paid for upgrade meat,old lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't even get to the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seriously the best tacobell I've had in a long,Probably ruined every tacobell from now on by giving us piping hot,super crispy tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just Ghetto so after you pay for your food you have to pull back to wait to only have to pull forward once your food is ready,but why and they keep yo change like wtf I'm so done with this Taco Bell y'all funny so you don't want me to y'all make my food or some shit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have not eaten meat in six years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a 12 taco party pack,And the taco shells were completely shattered in my party box (also disappointed by the amount of meat),and barely had any chicken,The quasaritto was lacking most of the chicken,The quasadilla was missing cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For a Friday night we weren't expecting the best service considering it's a Friday night and who looks forward to working (you know) but to our surprise the team working tonight we're ON IT and not just pumping food out ,but quality service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was made wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now its simply overpriced ""chow""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food at this branch is a 1 star experience,Half filled burritos,and they never grill your burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I had a seven-layer burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just ordered food,and I was waiting for my order at curbside and witnessed a worker drop the food on the floor,and then another worker saw it and ordered her to pick up the food from the floor quickly then looked around to make sure,no one was watching them picked up the food from the floor ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went to get soft potato tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
crunchy taco,There is also a vegetarian variant that subs black beans for the meat,cheese,sour cream & tomatoes,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today they got the order wrong and the food was terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also have not had any issues with food,I also enjoy the Doritos Locos tacos (nacho, cheese flavored,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Taco Bell is absolutely the worst Taco Bell ever I always get mini chicken quesadillas substitute the shredded,chicken for grilled chicken with no sauce,And they wanted to up charge me and on the screen it said substitute beef or chicken additional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
needed greasy food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is never as promised with low, quality ingredients ,and bad taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and yet still the woman taking my order was very impatient and seemed annoyed that I was ordering food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food I did receive is very skimpily made,Also I asked specifically for no sour cream ,and ended up with sour cream in both items,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location usually has the proper amount of toppings and the food tastes freshly made,The quality is consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enough to have our food in less then 1 hour it's  unbelievable,the food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Food is half done and the service is really slow - 28 minutes from order to receiving food, We ate and was on the way out of the restaurant when the guys behind us had finally got their food - 6 regular, tacos sm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They cannot figure out how to get food out to customers & ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I'm in the mood for authentic Mexican food,The food is always hot,Their prices are competitive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FYI if your a vegetarian they now deep fry chips and hash browns in the same oil as the chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food has been fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mainly the food allergy,They've been adding onions to my burritos which is a serious,They last 4 times I've gotten the chips with cheese,they've forgotten the chips,3/4 times I double checked and of course the chips weren't in there,They've switched up the employees the last few months which you can tell has hurt the line in the back as well as the quality of service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We were greeted right away and got our food within just a couple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went in there last night and the new black employee had a fight with three other black guys over sour cream on a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On top of screwing up a taco supreme they also managed to mess up the nacho, cheese chalupa by forgetting the nacho,cheese,Tomatoes and sour cream left out of my Taco supreme 10:30 pm ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as rice then they have no right to be in food business,Our order for four Bean Rice and Cheese burrito got delayed because another customer was unhappy,Once we got our burritos we all felt like it wasn't the usual,Then we started coming across bunches of uncooked rice which were so hard, taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went there tonight and picked up half Taco Bell and half Pizza Hut food,The pizza though had to have been made at least an hour prior to my visit and was maybe one of the worst pizzas I've tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Is it to serve quality quasi-Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband stops here after work to pick up food for 3 people,and all they do is give him the missing food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I love the taste of their food, Well the way Taco Bell Drive through works is that they do not give you the actual receipt till they give you the food , But for some reason the receipt was never given until the food is given to the customer,I paid for the food ,which in the end he just wanted to provide us with free food,we do not ask for free food based on the fact that it feels that we get something for nothing,it is not about free food, I know it is Mexican food, I love the taste of the food ,     So I go through the drive-thru to order 2 bean and cheese burritos,and 2 volcano burrito's with extra, On top of that they only gave me 1 bean and cheese burrito,but then again they only charged me for 1 bean and cheese burrito,looked onto the receipt and advised me that I never placed the 2nd burrito order, Then they gave me an extra bean and cheese burrito , meat ,,,,
 They always forget items and the food is always sloppy, with bare minimum of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All I got was an uncooked chicken quesadilla with NO HOT SAUCE I also did not get good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When we finally got our food,I need to see a dentist after biting into the food,I got a rice bowl and a burrito as well ,the taco shells were stale,and the rice wasn't fully cooked,The bowl was also soup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I could have eaten at a sit down restaurant with good food faster than this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unfortunately the food is different,The quality of the food is hit or miss without a doubt,I don't like getting ripped off but when you short me on orders for the kids and now I've got upset kids because someone is missing a couple of tacos,How you can screw up beans from a can is beyond me,I pay extra every time for sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She even brought our food to the table,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all while waiting for a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got the chicken taco ,The taco was good, besides the fact that it was very difficult to get the toppings in the same bite as the chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the staff have always been super friendly and the food comes out in a reasonable,we found out just how unhealthy chicken burritos from Taco Bell were and we have now taken it off the regular foods, We use to go here as our after church lunch stop on the way home because it was on the way along Slaughter and the entire family could go in and eat what they like for well under the $20 price point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Obvious because my last order contained zero lettuce,But lettuce was found in EVERY item,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why does my crunch wrap supereme taste like a donair,Why does the tortilla taste like lavaash,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Back then then called chili-cheese burritos ""chilito",but any more they seem to forget to put the cheese in the chili-CHEESE burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 His smart ass answer made me think I didn't want the food he would make me so I was going to ask for my money back,Waiting 15 min for 2 taco supremes is a bit much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but business's have scheduled hours for a reason and as a food establishment you should be able,"to provide your ""food"" inside those hours",beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was only one tablespoon of meat that would be better described as greasy dog food,I just got 4 tacos and 2 bean burritos,Also the burritos were just as devoid of substance,This was not an accident because all four tacos were the same,I've eaten at taco bells for decades but with the prices being higher than ever ,Hardly any lettuce and almost no cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had to take the chicken burritos back because the rice was so burnt,I received no sour cream and no salsa,Taco salad was ordered with extra sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can't expect the food to be 5 stars fresh,food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and we started asking where was our food,We could have gone to a real Mexican restaurant and got food faster,Your customer service is that bad and that is how you compensate customers who were patiently waiting for their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let me begin by saying I give it a 2 star because I like Taco Bell food ,I've even had them shove the food in my face,To top it off the last two times I went through the drive thru it took almost 30 mins to get my food,I also understand some things take time but nobody wants cold food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of their food never changes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tacos pretty well stuffed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've learned my lesson once and for all: with all of these awesome places to eat tacos in Austin it's time once ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a crunchy taco & everything tasted so fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible food quality,but usually you can count on some tasty junk food,I couldn't even eat the food I got,I went through the drive through and got a smothered burrito,The smothered burrito was dry,fiery Dorito taco supreme ,The taco was soggy,and a side of rice ,The rice was dried out ,and beans,The beans were obviously leftover from an old,and overlooked batch of beans,The cheese looked like it had never melted to begin with,barely anything in it and definitely no sour cream,Go to another location or go to Tijuana Flats around the corner,,,,,
I ordered one of the burritos off of their dollar menu,It was my burrito ,It was like fire and the beans fueled the flames of fury,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once i finally got my food it looked like shit like a 3 year old,i asked for my money back i wasnt going to eat the food it was all messy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Walked in at 8 pm and was promptly informed that the location was ""out of food",but this is FAST food for a reason,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you make my stomach hurt and I think your food is made with horse,soft tacos will always help a hangover,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So we had gone into a different taco bell and the food was horrible,How many of you don't go like to go through a drive through because when you do they mess the order up and maybe you have a food allergy to onions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All the ingredients were in a small clump on ONE SIDE so my pregnancy dreams of the ""meat"" covered in ""cheese"" were dashed as I bit into a taco she'll wrapped in a tortilla",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco Bell food is the same,we once got a bonus burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Little worried our food would be bad,since it was right before close but our food was fantastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I spent 15 mins in the drive thru line before getting my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have forgotten things and this time my food wasn't even cooked all the way through,That 'it's not possibly to not be cooked right' but I pulled out the food ,It's one thing to get my food wrong,but to tell me I'm wrong after I showed you the food wasn't even cooked,cheese still raw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When a worker (who obviously doesn't want to be there but has checked Instagram 16 times since you made your order) hands you your food from the drive-thru,"That look - the confused gaze they give you - seems like they just reached into a trough (see ""NOTE"" at end of review) of Taco Bell food slop ",it's easy to pay for food (read that again ,Whatever you order (be it three tacos ,too much sour cream,but the overall presentation and taste hit every spot imaginable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mario brought me my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GM refuses to allow poorly made food go out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is carefully prepared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like what you see in the pic is it sticking out of the food,The queso was way too spicy and I like spicy foods,I ordered the steakhouse burrito with chips ,barely any steak in the burrito,All of the ingredients are just wrong,The key to any restaurant is quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and my food without saying more than three words,"It should literally take these people SECONDS to make these ""tacos"" ",ordered a quesadilla combo with a cheese roll up ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took quite a long time to get a crunchy taco and chili cheese burrito to go ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This last time my food was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is OK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last time I went there was no one in line and still switched out my chips with a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Generally I'm waiting about 10-20 minutes for food,because the food is delicious,What could possibly take them that long to make a burrito,2 tacos ,He one time picked up a bowl ,""" And the manager interrupted "" know your station"" and threw the bowl",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took 40 minutes to make 3 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
although this one did not give me food poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Certain Taco Bells (I call them the gourmet taco bells) have better tasting food ,I always order my food meatless ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The Grande Scrambler Combo was a lot of food,but the meal was quite satisfying and the service was immediate with hot/fresh food,priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One steak taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The order took 20 minutes for our food,who waited 15 minutes for his food ,The food was OK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's taco Bell machines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really shows lack of customer care and the food doesn't seem to come out to what's it's supposed to be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The service was fun and fast and the food was good,I went through this location and they have a new black bean burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I got my food in a minute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality has stepped up alot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another thing I especially liked was for the 7-layer burrito I ordered the tortilla was crispy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TB is TB (not to be mistaken for tuberculosis lol) but you get what you get and when you're under the influence This food is heavenly,others chicken chalupas ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a burrito supreme, I spoke to Leslie the manager (we think it was her at the window) and she said she put me down on the list to receive a bell grande and a burrito supreme ,Even the nacho dorito taco requested was the fire one instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Long waits and some how they make the food here even worse than Taco Bell is known for usually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it me or are they also stingy with the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They even repeated the order back when he picked up the food,Got home to find out food was missing,My tacos were also cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Slow AF took 30 minutes to get food 2nd person in the drive through line then the guy didn't give us napkins/sauce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered 6 soft tacos ,and 6 crunchy tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a steak flat bread and its chicken, I ordered a steak Gordita - it has barely half a scoop of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is not food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a bean and cheese only burrito,bean burrito stuffed with onions, A taco, Got home with a taco no cheese,and some concoction that had rice,and a beef and cheese only burito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They replaced the missing items but only a after they refused to give a refund as we no longer wanted the subpar food,When we brought this to the manager's attention (along with the missing chips and taco -- all of which were flattened ,I thought it would get me more than one ounce of nacho cheese in a two-ounce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Taco Bell is the cheapest of the cheap food options in Happy,it's my go-to fix when I'm craving some of that fast-food flavor we Americans hate to admit that we love,and the incredibly small amount of meat they put into their food (even by Taco Bell st,4) It's lower-calorie food as well, Their abysmal customer service keeps me away until that craving for a taco becomes too strong, They're usually out of one or two ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Clearly a cheap corner cutter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm still stuck on the Doritos taco 5 box,This is my taco bel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's the same 5-9 ingredients in 4-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 1St time food was all old,2nd time we got the wrong item for him and my burrito was cold,Today I went inside and ordered the cantina burrito ,and she charged me for the bowl which is $2 more  and I didn't feel like waiting for her to go get her manager to fix it-  I wanted the burrito so I could eat it while waiting on the bus, and beans tasted burned ,but tasted okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was made properly, When I got home and started eating the hard shell taco was broken into several, I worked at a Taco Bell when those suckers first came out and I know what they're supposed to look and taste like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love have they always have there own special taco mtn dew flavors Baja blast is awesome,I love bean and cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really feel like the crunchy ground beef tacos are 5 star,fast food tacos,I am sad that they have discontinued the Verde green salsa but my Fresco tacos,I rarely eat fast food but when I do it's often crunchy Fresco tacos or the Doritos crunchy loco tacos,I always get them Fresco Style so they skip all the dairy & pile them up with lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco Bell is one of those fast food chains that can make most things with beans instead of beef ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I finally tried the new dorito taco shell,and same quality as any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They totally skimp you on the food inside the tortilla,I just wish that they would give you the amount of food that all the other,but sometimes they get the no meat,cheese,I always order the contract supreme no sour cream,They get the no sour cream part right,no lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they told me they ran out of straws and my food was cold,I was the designated driver this evening and I was trying to grab food for everybody,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,Cheap price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Employees laughing and playing around instead of taking your order and if you stay long enough to actually order you'll wait forever for your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ummm this disgusting frozen ""food"" only needs to be microwaved","My boyfriend wanted their breakfast ""taco"" that's on a biscuit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is the food prepared reasonably well ,there have been numerous times when the food has not been heated up properly so loss of marks there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is rad,I don't feel bad about ordering a zillion lbs of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The kfc food tgere is good,The food is always fres,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I did not receive my food in h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The menu prices are totally different,from the price they ring up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Got food home ,The tacos were half,The chicken looks as though it's been sitting around for not hours ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They are always short staffed and it takes FOREVER to get food,I've even had my food comped because I was waiting so long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they told me they ran out of straws and my food was cold,I was the designated driver this evening and I was trying to grab food for everybody,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they shorted us food ,There is a carls jr and green burrito right down the street that is MUCH better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I can tell you that the majority of the time either the food is created incorrectly or there is a missing product from the order,I work close and this is my go to spot for food ,I placed my order and they immediately - the woman - who may have actually been wearing a manager shirt - started to make my food,your food ,it had like a tablespoon of all the ingredients in it - was mostly a tortilla - I didnt order a tortilla LOL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10min later I got my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It is the same Taco Bell you'll find on any street corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they send like 8 people to break at the same time And last time I was there there was only 1 girl preparing food for the drive threw ,I sat there for 30 min for 2 plain tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My wife ordered two fresco tacos,The only negative was that her taco shells were very fragile,I recommend the mild since the chicken already has some kick provided by the marinade they use,At most locations she has to pick bits of cheese out of it,and it looked and tasted just as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Order 2 hard tacos and a Mexican pizza and you'll get a burrito, a soft taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I place an order and my burrito is grilling,may I have another grilled stuffed burrito please,rice,Marinated chicken,and beans,beans,salsa,How can you go wrong with grilled meat,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,
this Taco Bell meets the uniform franchise quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered ice water to go with our food ,We paid for our food ,we waited for the food to ask again,The food came ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I give two stars for the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do the beans turn into gremlins after 11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It shouldn't take 30 minutes to get 5 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast food often so this is definitely a bumme,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it tastes so good,taste good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Order is never right and I swear everytime I order anything with meat whether it be a taco,I think they are rationing the meat and using beans as a filler gross,There is so little meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and consistently good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the burritos were slightly larger at this location last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The meat of the tacos,Never going back to this location again let's see what happens to my stomach after eating half of that taco,The meat smelled ,tastes like there was bug spray it in,and tasted like there was bug spray in it I ended up eating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 stars only because the beef XXL stuffed burrito is delicious,This place consistently screws up my order and is constantly out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had to repeat my order three times: six crunchy tacos,She kept thinking I was saying 'six soft tacos',They got the tacos made fairly quickly,so I can eat a taco with no sauce at all,I sit down again and open my bag of tacos,I just loudly called back into the kitchen that I needed two more crispy tacos because they didn't give me enough,I told her I was siting near the exit and to bring my tacos out to me,Five minutes later I still don't have my other tacos,I told her I was waiting for two extra tacos ,and then another lady realized that my tacos were just sitting next,another mistake: they were soft tacos,not crispy tacos,I dropped them right back on the counter without a word and went back to eat my last taco,the tacos were terrible,If these people can't get make a decent taco to company specs,There was only about half the expected amount of meat,and whoever made them slopped meat sauce everywhere on the shells,lettuce and cheese,,
A taste double dare,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and then when I received my order the girl spilled my drink all over the inside of my car and on top of me and I finally ate my food immediately after I got it while I was driving ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they told me they ran out of straws and my food was cold,I was the designated driver this evening and I was trying to grab food for everybody,because I had already ordered and paid for my food,They refused services even though I already paid for my food,But I actually got was a burrito supreme with three tacos ,Update: tonight I ordered a combination meal that should have a Mexican pizza and two tacos,and three additional taco Supremes,my Mexican Pizza is two tortillas with refuted beans inside ,NO cheese,and salad on top,,,,,,,,,,
 Your food is not that complicated to prepare,I guess when I need my taco fix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" I wanted to try and be nice because everyone knows a horror story of someone spitting in food",He gave me the rest of my food ,chicken,beans,and cheese,And these are not ingredients a Taco Bell can survive without,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Takes forever to get your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The service & food is ""good",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and received my food at 7:41, I could have ordered and ate at a steakhouse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They throw your food in the bag ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While I stand here waiting for my food I can see the sadness in everyone's faces,'We already paid for our foods ,Expect a 15 minute wait time for this hard to make food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they told me they ran out of straws and my food was cold,I was the designated driver this evening and I was trying to grab food for everybody,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first time I went the food ,then when we got our food it was 100% burnt ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 After waiting  for 30 minutes I got my food I was patiently waiting until I get home I live five minutes away from the Taco Bell on Buford Highway  Ga,The only thing I ate was the hard shell taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There wasn't even anyone in the food prep,Out of taco meet at 8:30 on a Saturday night,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why did she charge me 80 cents each taco she sub the meat on,Then on top of that I still paid the extra 80 cents each and I ask for sour cream on my tacos,Plus my daughter tacos had like 5 small, little pieces of chicken that I paid 80 cents extra,No sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is not great,reasonable price,tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they told me they ran out of straws and my food was cold,I was the designated driver this evening and I was trying to grab food for everybody,But I actually got was a burrito supreme with three tacos ,Update: tonight I ordered a combination meal that should have a Mexican pizza and two tacos,and three additional taco Supremes,my Mexican Pizza is two tortillas with refuted beans inside ,NO cheese,and salad on top,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place sucks cause I ordered a burrito ,and they gave me 3 taco's instead ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Murray and Allen TB is about the same time and even though it's walk in only they are on point every time with amazing quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but always find myself leaving after 20 min of waiting to order/get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered tacos ,and 3 Burritos and all my tacos are broken on the bottoms,But lately the quality is getting lower,They really need to work on there quality control,and tasted like they been sitting out all day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but as I was waiting for my food I witnessed her bend over , I submitted an order and then called the location about five minutes later to verify that it had received it and if the food was ready,"a female employee rudely informed me that ""We're out of lettuce",so if you order something with lettuce you won't get any lettuce on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And there's potentially more food in the wrap than there is in the pizza,Spicy chicken crunchwrap supreme,Devil: Or Mexican pizza AND spicy chicken crunchwrap supreme ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited nearly 20 minutes before leaving without food,It convinced me to continue eat salads ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was also poorly made,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It doesn't even matter at this point if the food is good,I could've had my food brought to me in a sit down restaurant much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I order my food not only does it take forever ,Last time i ordered a cheesy Frito burrito ,Good luck at being successful human beings in life when you forget the Fritos in a friros burrito,cheese sauce and rice,No meat or fritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This may not sound like a big deal but then I thought about what if they messed with the food,Maybe retail/food service is not your thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the amount of food you get for what you pay has gone down seventy percent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
continuous 20 minute food waits,out of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like Taco Bell food ,Taco Bell food is great, It's not fast food when it takes us 20 minutes just to get a couple of burritos in the middle of the night with no business ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What can I say - amidst all the rumors and allegations of meat additives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You wait on a typical restaurant 1/2 hour for your food still waiting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Mexican food trailer is located on the Valero lot at 3419 Slaughter Lane,Their soft tacos,Lea and I tried a sampling of their menu: 4 tacos,with your choice of meat,On the other side of the lot today were a sno-cone trailer and a corn on the cob trailer,Each of them was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those Doritos tacos are ass,they were doing a special on steak nachos one time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but we got food poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they forgot a taco after I realized it I was already back home,So I get the taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inconsistent food - The quality ,and size of the food varies greatly with each order, They have very lame skills with the sour cream gun as well, Usually sour cream is only at one end of the item,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is fine,the issue is the amount of time it takes the people working to make the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food came out cold,After I threw my food away,taste unsatisfying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just know what you get will be a mess of sloppily built and smushed together ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food hot,Veggie burritos acquired ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They always fix if right away and give us extra food while letting us keep the incorrect,The food is like any Taco Bell food so I don't know how much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fight behind the counter whilst not making your food,and I've seen this while a cop waited 15 mins inside for his food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 So you're between PDX and NoPo and you need some mildly-buzzed food,The food itself was particularly good,The 7 layer burrito was oh so good,Enjoyed her hard-shell taco,Now if only I could ensure that my airplane trip (with previously mentioned Pekingese dog and 25 month old niece) would go as well as my delicious foray into MLK Blvd,it tastes so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Same thing happened two weeks ago when my wife and dropped by for a Mexican food fix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Did not ask if we wanted chicken or beef,Gave us beef & we wanted chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't consider them 'mexican' food,Other than the occassional taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It only took us about two minutes to get from the restaurant to my friend's house and the food was already lukewarm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Just had the most delicious burrito from Uber Eats ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's really close to my house and I always get great service and my food is always hot,Unfortunately Taco Bell has a reputation for being not very nice and bad with food h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She snapped at me twice and did not say anything after she handed me the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The guy at the window has been here for 15 min and he just left without receiving his food ,Ppl want their tacos :,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Company ordered a variety of foods from this location for a lunch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not to expect good customer service but at least get the food i paid for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they told me they ran out of straws and my food was cold,I was the designated driver this evening and I was trying to grab food for everybody,my Mexican Pizza is two tortillas with refuted beans inside ,NO cheese,and salad on top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a taco salad,Glad to see I'm not the only one that noticed the prices are different,yet it ran up the price of the meal,that's the right price ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Over 1hr wait trapped in drive thru and then a SNOTTY food service girl to boot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is cheap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always get the correct order and the food matches the st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This naturally leads to excessive wait times for food,clean restaurant and the food quality you expect from a Taco Bell,And sometimes you just crave a mediocre taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We now have to usually drive to Sunbury Rd to eat food after 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
next time I would like efficiency & professional service with a pick up order for American Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you're looking for a Yelp review of Taco Bell food ,when I get that occasional idea in my head that I need to destroy my digestive system with a chicken quesadilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was NOT looking for free food or any type of compensation,but I stopped here last night half way through a 6hr drive from Seattle to Eugene and got a burrito with some type of foreign,I inspected my burrito ,(I still do not know for sure what it was in my burrito,It looked and felt like glass to me so I called the location right away to tell them to stop serving the beans,"She told me that it was impossible because they don't have ""glass products"" and that it was ""probably just lettuce""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and they dont stuff their tacos like literally all the other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A negative review from someone that simply doesn't approve of junk food isn't really a review is it,pleasant and the food is inexpensive,I love their Fiery Doritos taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they always are very fast and professional with preparing my food/ taking my order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are two people in line in front of me getting food ,they have never given me my food while st,even though I've been standing at the counter the entire time and have no food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So the food is typical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know it's not a high paying job but they should at least have manners while taking your order and giving you food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They cannot figure out how to get food out to customers & ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco Bell out of meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and still came home with the wrong food,we both work in the food industry,It's Texas so many other options around especially for Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yelp insists this is a food truck (or cart as we call them in Portl,does not rise to the standard of the worst food cart I've ate at,The quality of those edibles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two hard tacos were completely smash as if they did it on purpose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it came in foil instead of paper wrap like other burritos,we ordered a chicken griller ,"and got ""mini shredded chicken ques"" whatever that is",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and then was told to wait at the pit for my food,"I'm lame) I ask her ""do you guys have a protein bowl","So I ask ""is there a way I could add egg to the power bowl or maybe substitute for something in the power bowl",I wish I knew this lady's name but her attitude was so awful and I promise you I will just go to the taco bell on 620 in Lakeway instead because they are always very kind and hook it up big time for me with the power bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We will not be spending money at this location as they DO NOT CARE about the quality of customer service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ended up with a meat taco,beans instead,I asked for no meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The dine in area also closes a half hour early rather then 11pm forcing everyone to go through the drive through and waiting 30 minutes to order there food to find that they stop serving early,cantina bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There were issues with food,2) burrito barely wrapped insides all over the paper ,1) tacos no cheese (forgot),Even though I live around the corner if we want taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is a chicken chip,"So a chicken chip is pressed chicken in the shape of a dorito about 1/4"" thick",The order comes with chees and reminded me of Tyson chicken patties,What is it about that taco bell taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the food was still cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
waiting 30+ minutes for your food,cold food (,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is consistent,and the price is cheap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and food seemed really clean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 After being trapped in the drive thru for over 1 HOUR only to be  greeted by a SNOTTY food service person,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Regular hard tacos,Beef Meximelt steamed twice and Mexican pizza add pico de gallo tastes the best,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you really should just comp the 2 chili cheese burritos I ordered because I really don't want 4 of them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place has good food ,when I called the manager told me to bring the food back ,when I told him I didn't have time he argued that he made the order right and told me I needed to freeze the food ,I ordered a 12 pack of soft taco supreme without tomatoes ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went there tonight and the food took over 25 min for $5,00 worth of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I think Tijuana flats down the street can serve food faster,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know most fast-food places have timed expectations for how long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
two soft tacos,"pissant Soft Taco over here took care of that - Leaked intel that he contains ""salad"" - shredded lettuce",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Out of nowhere a girl comes up and says jokingly we're out of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PROS: no rodents or insects in food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food ,and tacos aren't tacos without the sauce,Pros:  This place usually has good Tex Mex at a reasonable price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I order a taco salad it's missing half a bowl of ingredients like what the f,I'm hungry and drove 20 min out of my way cause I had a craving for taco salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is always hot,I literally get the same thing every time and it's delicious with lots of extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Been sitting in the drive thru line for 20 minutes and still don't have my food, Quesadilla and burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I come here it is absolute chaos and I don't even get my food in time to eat it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This review is for the Taco Bell KFC food chain close to the Chapters store near Pinetree Way in Coquitlam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But they get something wrong every time and barely put meat in the tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location gets the job done with the same and desired taco food quality,They do a great job preparing the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best tacobell around,Gave me a coupon for a free biscuit taco on Cinco de Mayo,You gotta ask for salsa and syrup for your waffle taco (see pic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can't rate the food because this was my first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They offered to knock a single taco off our bill to make up for the inconvenience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With or without cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 But I love Taco Bell food just the sam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food has always been,ordered a #3 (3 crunchy taco supreme's),only the taco supreme's did,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The plain hard taco shells were rancid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited over 15 minutes for three tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If I order a few of those beef burrito with cheese,3 hard tacos with no cheese ,and they did leave that out but overloaded the lettuce to where  I could of made a salad out of all three tacos is a waste ,If I order a Mexican Pizza without the beans,and very dumb to have that much with as little meat they put on it anyway, & sour cream ,and I order without sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first time the food was tossed together,The employees don't care what the customers think or how the food is presented,The burritos were barely rolled ,I had ordered a taco supreme ,and all it had was meat ,and cheese,and they were missing ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and i have noticed that there is a lot of variation in the food,During the day the food is night ,on more then one occasion I've driven back through to request that they actually make my food right,Never the less the food here is always hot,Which if you are a fan of fourth meal you know the food is typically warm,by which i mean that my burrito i,However after about 11:00 pm Hitting up the drive thru and my burrito is like half full,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The woman at the window handed me my food,I was skeptical of the giggling so I pulled forward and checked my food,They intentionally messed my food up,When she had taken my food back I heard the kitchen,staff complaining about remaking my food ,It looks as if they just throw unwanted or incorrect food ok the floor,a crushed hard taco( that I didn't even order) ,I ordered a Mexican pizza and a chicken quesadilla,and then it looked as if they had crushed my quesadilla in their fingers because there was finger marks imprinted in the cheese,,,,,,,,,,,
 But it is good to see they are thinking about people with food allergens, According to their ingredient statement it should be OK to eat,There is a posting of their ingredients,com/nutrition/documents/tb_ingredient_statement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is almost always hot,My usual is the crunchy taco supreme ,I recently tried the rolled chicken tacos (which are really just taquitos) with the nacho,but I prefer the cheese since the tacos,They also have guacamole ,The guacamole is okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
using expired food products ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took about 10 minutes to get the food even though the restaurant was empty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Besides the ""kerfuffle"" with the missing food",we discovered one of the combo meals and the loaders were missing from our order - which we were charged for - not only that they charged us for two extra tacos,a steak gordita,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the last year and a half I have never gotten my food faster than 15 min in the drive threw,Wendy's got our money and our food out in 5 min,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered 2 double decker tacos ,I got to the window and the two girls seemed to be having a 'spat' I paid what I thought was more than average but have noticed the prices seem to differ from location to location ,They tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best food option to have tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Needless to say we cancelled our order and needed to find some other options in the food desert that is Lakeway after 9pm,I went here at about 10pm on Friday night and after placing our order they notified us that they were out of beans,more than 80% of their menu requires beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When they aren't waiting for glaciers to melt before serving you your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and also slung my bag of food out of the window onto the top of my door ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Line in the drive-thru is never quick it's a insane wait if u want food,Then when u get ur food it's usually always wrong,sometimes someone else's food even,Possibly the worst taco Bell I've ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love this Taco Bell it's the best and thy server the best tacos,Please go here when you need tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm pleased to report it has gotten much better last couple times he orders of been correct and the food is been hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and typical Taco Bell food, I ordered a couple of burritos,and enjoyed my two burritos with their new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and their Nacho Bell Grande with lettuce on top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What is going on with the food i,Ive never had such a sad taco supreme before,i should have taken a pic of the soft taco as well,Lettuce cheese is almost non,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh yeah and the guy that was taking the money and handling the food rubbed his h,My burrito Supremes only bean,My Frito burrito no Frito no meat only bean, no meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make the taco a soft,taco,chicken quesadilla with no jalapeño sauce, Two times ago it looked great but I got home to find the bottom side black as could be and tasted terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we ordered food ,And free food won't make up for the mistakes because we would put you out of business just on free,food that's how bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our food was a mess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
without speaking quickly handed my food through the takeout window,After I ate the food I immediately felt intense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just got my food ,The food is awful,taco was soggy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like their crispy tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pretty fast for our current situation with it only being drive threw but employees being rude when being corrected on a order or saying ""ugh my god"" when adding to the order and then giving us shitty slimes tacos ",after charging for supreme tacos ,and forgetting to add sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yoo this has way too little meat,all I taste is tortilla with lettuce and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The one star goes to the pleasant looking older lady who actually was making all the food behind the counter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are not quick getting your food to you,I waited over 20 minutes for my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Taco Bell but this location always forgets to put meat on my crunch wraps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she proceeded to tell us she had to make the food ,We placed our order while the shift leader then went to stand by the drive thru window and not make our food,Watched her berate the cool about something while he was preparing our food from the dining area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rush was super small and I know for a fact that you can't deny a customer any food for no reason,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been at this exact Taco Bell many many times and LITERALLY EVERY TIME it takes forever to get our food,At times we went through and they would greet us and not order our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sad sad burrito here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I walked into the kfc/taco bell location and asked what comes in a seven layer burrito,"I was told ""I don't know I don't eat it"" i than asked for a different Taco Bell item as I heard a MANAGER from what seemed to be the drive through line say ""WE NOT TAKING NO TACO BELL ORDERS"" and when I asked why the reason was ""the girl who do Taco Bell  is on break an I can't do Taco Bell unless you want a simple taco or something"" mind you this was a MANAGER informing me that due",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
& the food portions actually look like the menu board pictures , They do not make you feel like you are bothering them like a lot of food service employees do at other,Our favorite employee prepares our food,unwrapped your food ,the food portions are terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Purchased a grande meal yesterday the lettuce in the soft tacos tasted contaminated with chemical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cash register girl wasn't very knowledgeable of her own menu and I tried to essentially recreate the double chalupa that she says doesn't exist anymore and ended up spending $12 for 3 tacos and a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't remember the food tasting as bl,tastier and even cheaper Mexican food,There is also fast-food competition from Taco Luis which makes burritos that are twice as large,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But you would think there might be a little more lettuce in a taco salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They regularly do not serve customers or claim they are out of ingredients,one time they claimed they were out of every ingredient on the menu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It's to bad too because the food had finally started to get better for once after going downhill, The Taco Bell at Brodie and William Cannon is a little further away but the food is better ,they Wanted to charged me for putting the cheese for the taco on the side, I told them that I've never had to pay for them to put the cheese I didn't get on the taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For my free items i got what i ordered previously ordered which was supreme Doritos locos taco with no lettuce because it's disgustingly soggy,But this taco has only fucking,Please just save yourself the fucking trouble and go to chipotle or better yet chop up ur, meat ,and cheese,It's suppose to come with sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When we asked for taco sauce they LAUGHED at us ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When we got our order it was evident that it was hastily thrown together and the quality of the food was just awful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place sometimes takes over a half hour to get your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Currently it has been 22 mins since we ordered our food inside ,and we still do not have our food yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was so scrumptious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After they somehow lost my order and the awesome cashier was trying to get my food with limited,I guess cleaning up a few bits of lettuce is more important,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food there was so amazing, I've now learned to not eat so much junk food at once because it will later come back to haunt you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is NEVER made to my asking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I ordered 2 Taco Supremes and if you enjoy lettuce tacos then this is your location, Everything else that I ordered was fine so maybe they were running low on meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited 30 mins for our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One time on free taco day they locked all the doors during business hours and we couldn't even get food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have an issue there every time and my food is poorly prepared so I won't be coming back to this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is just a reminder why I don't need to eat crappy food because of crappy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She gave me one bag of food,I had to wave this girl down at the window and tell her my food was missing,So I assumed all my food was in one bag,Well I got home and opened my bag of food two soft, tacos ,There was lettuce and cheese all over my wrapped tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Would be quicker burning it down and rebuilding something else than waiting for your food,they charged me for a $4 burrito which 1,Like what kind of taco joint doesn't have beef,It's your main ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when we received our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a normal example of quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Being vegetarian and specifically saying ""vegetarian 7 layer burrito""",the worker repeating it and gives you one with ground meat in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
train your employees to NOT ONLY make food correctly,My food was served inedible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is stale,foods cold,foods dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I checked my food for spit or anything else before eating it,Your job is to make food like you would want to eat it,And the tacos I got,they were the saddest looking tacos I have ever seen,It was easy to check cuz you would think a supreme crunchy taco would be loaded right,the taco wasnt even halfway full,sad crunchy tacos that is,because if you ladies make yourself tacos I'm sure,Thank you Kiana for your kindness and the extra taco,6 little tomatoes and I could barely find the sour cream,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of the food has declined - not a word of a lie,the 2 piece meal chicken drumstick was the size of a large drumette (what you would get when when you order chicken wings) and the hard shell tacos were a little more then half full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually just get a taco salad ,and change the beef to beans ,and ask for no cheese or sour, cream but lately they'll cheap me on everything and give me a lot of lettuce -,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some cheap burritos,or some tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited 30 minutes for the worst food I've ever eaten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Asked for a side of rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I used to love taco Bell,this taco Bell with it's awful,service has made me forever and always HATE taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Order was as expected and tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Better than expected for a taco place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't know where these other reviews came from but my food is always made fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
customer service to food quality,The taco shells were obviously stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I never understood why people complain about food quality from taco bell - you pay for what you get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was in the drive thru and ordered a fiery taco supreme,I check my taco,The next taco I received had sour,It was all over my hands and the whole taco was falling out of the shell,which includes sour cream,and there is no sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I order two burritos ,and got none but two tacos,The people here don't care about their job or quality of work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm immediately sent to a parking spot and told to wait on my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The problem with this Taco Bell isn't the food or the staff,The food is usually hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is really fresh,It also serves Pizza Hut food which is a huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I've had bean burritos that were watery,and quesadillas which have been rimmed with burned cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Missing an item which was a crunchy taco supreme with extra,Also the two soft tacos I did receive were ordered with extra,cheese which we all know cost money and they did not have extra cheese so I myself am missing a taco ,and two tacos that were ordered for someone else didn't even get the extra,cheese , cheese that was paid for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But I got beef in my burrito,and if the beans are not vegetarian,I was assured the beans were meat,Today I ate meat for the first,Did I want to eat meat, that I wouldn't order it(some places put a meat stock to make it taste better),is not meat free,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been to this location two times within two weeks and both times they had a sign about a tortilla shortage so they couldn't make burritos or certain,"""we don't have burritos",tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were all staring at me giving me dirty looks and finally the manager (I'm assuming) opens the window and hands me a bag with the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
About 3 times a week and today I got my order and my burrito was half empty,my taco was completely crushed I had to eat it in half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Someone needs to canvass manager every time I go here it's always a I did you such a big huge favor and basically you owe him I showed up here 10 minutes before closing and by the time I got up to the front desk which even the receipt I have says 258 he sits here and tells me and make sure to make a point of it that he did me a favor after hours and then I should be so lucky it's a larger white guy manager and it's nothing but problems with him every time and I've also heard it from my friends I'm seriously sick of it you always act like everything's an issue it's such a hassle to go there and makes me not even want to come here anymore I've always said and told everybody this is the best taco Bell around ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hit the drive thru earlier got the food quickly with friendly,service and tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and when I went back they were just going to give me the food that didn't come in the bag,Now when I got my remade food,the tacos were so skimpy,The tacos barely had any meat at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This ruined tacobell for m,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a fresco style spicy potato taco,i had cheese and chipotle on my taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but every time the food is horrible,I'm really hoping they put some managers in place at the gender road location that know what they are doing and properly train there employees to make food that will encourage their customers to return,Recently I got 2 chili cheese burritos ,They actually put chili on their burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just wants some tacos lo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If i did not want the food remade i should absolutely have the option to have my money back,If she simply looked at the ticket and spoke to us like adults rather than some hoodlums that were trying to get free food we would have happily explained our drinks ,I don't know about her but $20 of Taco bell isn't breaking my bank and we literally only wanted our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am a regular here and I use coupons to get my tacos,The tall lady that makes the tacos in the back was complaining about it to her coworker ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then I stood around for 10-15 minutes and when I finally received my food,To top it all off my burrito came with hamburger instead of steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never changes the cooking oil my food tasted awful, just threw it in the garbage it was so bad and tasted just awful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ordered at maybe 11:30 and when I got my food the chicken wasn't even warm,I rolled past the window and having previously worked in the food industry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food ordered during the day is the soiled old crap from the night before and the food served at night takes wayyyyy too long,Ordered food at night,And I said the cheese wasn't on the side and the beans weren't there,"They give me a new triple layer nachos ""with cheese on the side"" and just give me a container of chips with red sauce on it with cheese on the side -_- still no refried beans",all I asked for was the nacho cheese to be on the side-,side by the time I get home it's so soggy from the cheese,So I get the nachos with red sauce and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spicy potato taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My tortilla was stale on my beefy frito burritos,oh and strike 3 for the win the chips on my triple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I did get my food,& continued preparing food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finally staff said its better to  use computer kiosk to order a simple taco since it appeared no one was taking orders at the counter,  Taco tasted cold even though the order was accurate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I could see people in the lobby getting their food ,When I finally did get my food,Got home and the food was so tiny,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They must have newer management because the help is always very friendly and the food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The ""steak""  they gave me was straight up dog food status",stale taco shells,She got a soft taco with no sour,I took a bite and the meat was so dried out that it was crunchy,This past order I got a steak quesarito,no cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had an $18 order and got about $10 worth of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You have to check in at the drive thru order kiosk before they start to prepare your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we're out of food ,This Taco bell is on a corner so,I drove around the other three corners ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was made quickly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 7-layer burrito,and the cheese potato thing burrito,but I can say with 100% certainty that Taco Bell has glued us back together with their cheese sauce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We waited in drive thru for 20minutes for 4 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Crunchwrap supreme 2 beefy frito burritos ,and 2 chips ,and cheese took them 30 minutes on Saturday night,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The speaker quality is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the three tacos I ordered had 1/4 of the toppings that they should have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's usually only for my four year old daughter whose order is a soft taco (no lettuce) ,they messed up the soft taco ,We used to order from this Taco Bell a lot because it's convenient for us as it's right around the corner ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted like rotten,Really disgusting food tonight,and they just threw in a cheese empanada in there after the girl at the drive thru told them I was vegan,there was no lettuce in it like usual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One out of ten visits my food is made correctly the first,This location is one of the worst I've visited in my life and I love stopping to get their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hopefully I don't get food poisoning from the lack of cleanliness,But food was good,Lol darn it tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never had a bad steak quesadilla at a taco bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seemed to be 4 people in one line making food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Buttttt I don't really love cold shredded cheese in a tortilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We ordered our Party Pack with NO sour cream, Made with sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not even knowing what you had to offer aside from a standard taco,You showed me everything I was missing over the years of eating only my normal homemade tacos - a hard,taco,What caught my eye was your cheese gordita,covered in more cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The wait until the food came out was about 13 minutes,The kfc food seemed to be quicker that taco bell to come out,Also given my food to go instead of dine  in,I want to eat tacos not be in a club,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast food do they get it,Order we three soft tacos,1 nacho cheese and chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Recurring timeliness issues along with the hair in my food this time has convinced me to use other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So you give me the nacho cheese sauce for the less than par chips,but you forget the chips in the bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Forced to wait for FAST food for as long as it would take to actually sit down at a full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never know whether food will be great,Today was the awful with thrown together burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't serve people food you wouldn't want to eat,besides me going through the drive through and to come home to find out I payed extra for the missing sour cream on both burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is going to be horrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only eat tbell once a month if that so I expect decent quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The hard taco shell was mushy on the bottom,like it had been sitting in the store for a while due to the grease from the taco meat,The crunchwrap supreme was pressed too hard in the press and the meat,cheese ,and lettuce were coming out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One being a shredded chicken toasted cheddar chalupa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What I am expecting is to get the food that I pay for,all of which I have been given an incorrect order or not received all of the food that I paid for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Plus it's always the slowest moving line in the history of ""fast"" food",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it took 46 minutes to get our food at 9pm tonight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheese ,and sour cream,lettuce,slightly thicker taste of the wrap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I guess they ALL must've ordered shredded chicken burritos ,when I finally got to the window they proceeded to tell me that they were out of shredded chicken ,) I opted for regular chicken instead ,and the employee tells me it will be more money for regular chicken,it's still not the end : even with the regular chicken ,whatever was ready and available I wont even mention the quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were out of nacho cheese,"  ""Go ahead and just put shredded cheese on the 3 items", It's not our fault you're out of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and a burrito also asked for hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today they said they don't have a knife in a food kitchen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ordered our food like normal,We received our food ,I asked if that's a new policy at tacobell,My boyfriend and I love tacobell,We were missing two chicken quesadillas ,and had two grilled chicken cheesey melts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as I am eating my food ,I'm starting to feel like I am getting food poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My biggest complaint is the long wait it takes to get ""fast"" food",And when you end up getting your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even the nacho cheese could not fix- ,and nacho cheese literally fixes everything,No level of hangover could make this delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If I want something inexpensive and consistent in quality I default to Taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and my beefy gordita supreme was a soft chicken tacos,just emptied out chips everywhere in the bag,Ordered a beefy gordita supreme and 2 orders of nachos with cheese dip,My order had no cheese dip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spent $19 and not only was my order wrong (missing a taco) ,but the crunchy taco shells were stale,Different taco Bell next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was AWFUL,I absolutely cannot stand lettuce and everytime I tried to take a bite there was lettuce in my food,and I had lettuce all in my steak quesadilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a clean restaurant or having my food come out good,get my food ,I just figured I would take a picture of the burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However the evening staff not so good have had to wait 15 minutes for my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even in a city like Austin where taco choices are abundant,and the guilty pleasure of a Dorito taco (why didn't they make these sooner, I also like nachos b/c chips ,and cheese, Not to mention it's got the uniform taste so you know that whichever Taco Bell you hit - it's going to taste exactly the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you're going to ask drive through customers to pull around front and wait for their food,I was finally able to flag down an employee who was bringing food out to someone else that was parked,after having my food sit on a counter inside for 20 minutes,The crunchy tacos fell apart ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
regular taco bell food you would get from any location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 regular soft tacos,I soft taco supreme,1 cheese Gordita crunch supreme ,and 1 nachos and cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 You know what your getting as far as food quality,order my food, 10 minutes between ordering and getting my food, Food here will taste the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for two number five boxes and a quesadilla meal with no chicken ,they gave me two number fives and a quesadilla with chicken instead ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with our food in hand,It's not like their making food from scratch or gourmet meals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They ALWAYS underfill tacos,Just lettuce and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I just went there at 3 am and they claimed they could not serve me any food because their ""whole",that all their food was cold," I said I didn't believe them because if their system ""just"" shut down then the food would be still be hot",sell me my burrito cold ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While most of the food I ordered was fine, I'm very surprised that the person making this item actually believed this was a serviceable food item,which is supposed to have a layer of cheese grilled and crusted to the top of the burrito, What I got instead was a burrito covered in cold shredded cheese that looked unappetizing,(four crunchy tacos),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They did have 6 workers and it took us 10 min to get food (no apology) it was dead,we got food poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some of the times the food is really good,and some of the time the food gives you diarrhea,Specially when it comes to the Happyvalley location seems like it's a hit or miss with the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know Taco Bell is not authentic Mexican food,I also know it's not even very good food,saying it was awful would be an insult to awful food,A mountain of dung covered in burned salsa sauce ,and a thick sheet of unmelted plastic cheese,but good taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Y'all literally put no meat in my Crunchwrap what the F,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered one meal with three regular tacos ,and one mea with three supreme tacos,got five regular tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am vegetarian and order my food without meat,I ordered five soft tacos ,but asked to substitute the meat with beans,he took the meat off but tried to charge me extra for beans,Instead of substituting the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Approximately 30 minutes I waited for 4 burritos on a Sunday night,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love this place my food is always made very well ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I stopped by today for lunch and almost decided to leave before I even got my food,The food was hot,The Dorito's shell was stale as was the burrito tortilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for the grilled cheese burrito with chicken instead of beef,As always they charge me for the chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thus our apartment is nearly devoid of all food,The man taking our order was very patient as we struggled through the daunting task of trying to order tacos while hiding hungerections caused by the excitement of being so close to real food for the first,we successfully communicated our desires to the magic food dispensing talking box,disappearing into the fluorescent food  palace of salvation,because not only did he get me that taco,free taco,No tomatoes on my taco,That was my first Doritos Locos taco ,The sound of cicadas and unnervingly-close gunfire permeate the torrid,,,,,,,,,,,
both of which had a human hair inside the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food is always great quality  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I stopped at the drive through on my way home and ordered a supreme Doritos locos taco,I get home to find that not only did I not get a correctly made taco,Pure and disappointing laziness that they couldn't even remake my single taco correctly ,and instead just gave me a side of sour cream (which still doesn't complete my correct taco order),you picked the wrong person to stiff on a taco,I was given a Doritos locos Taco with ONLY lettuce and some cheese in it,I politely explained that my Taco only had lettuce and cheese (still not sure,but she gave me a side of sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not even 1 napkin to accompany my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible service and terrible food, Hopefully I don't get food poisoning,The chips were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she brought the food home ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I couldn't let all of my new Yelp friends know that I was dishonoring the essence of an Orlando foodie by debasing myself to this level with my poor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 And its pretty disgusting to look at food laying all over the floor as you wait in the drive thru,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I ordered the soft tacos, The tacos are supposed to be supreme so even without the lettuce i was supposed to have tomato , All of my tacos came with only, meat ,and cheese,and sour cream in them, combo with no lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered inside to eat in the resturant and it took 13 minutes to receive four tacos and two burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mediocre Americanized Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Check your food before you drive off maybe even record yourself ordering as ridiculous,Messed up my 2 vegetarian burritos I ordered al fresco,They gave me a steak and a chicken burrito,I drive back to the restaurant after getting home to replace my burritos,The person at the window insisted on inspecting the burrito ,and made me give them my already purchased burritos back through the drive thru,They didnt seem to believe me like I was trying to scam them out of two 3 dollar burritos,This was hostile treatment just over me wanting to get the burritos I ordered,that the meat was actually beans,,,,,,,,,,,
you would think that you could get some decent food,For as much as they have raised their prices,We stopped coming here a few months ago and have been driving 15 minutes out of our way to visit a different location but because it's right around the corner from home,like it had been sitting all day and the ground beef tastes like it was left over from last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is gross,They need to check their food before serving it to people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I went inside to get my food exchanged for fresh,food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you go to this location you have to be very specific and check your food before you drive away,a crunch wrap and a bean burrito ,We were just here 10 minutes ago and we ordered three hardshell tacos,Not only did all of our tacos have meat on them,was horrified to find ground beef in his taco after he bit into it,and asked them to substitute the meat for refried beans on all of them,but that really didn't matter because it had meat in it ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No apology and an offer to eat at a place that caused food poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was alright,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took them another five minutes to bring food out,The person who gave me the food looked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went there last night at 9:10 it took 4 times to order a taco and 2 burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have yet to order from this location and have all the food be correct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this food is sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The time before took forever for my food ,and when I finally got my grilled cheese burrito it was pathetic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ask for Diorite  Loco taco supreme ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just picked up an order that I ordered online in the food was very mediocre,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The biggest disappointment turned into how my chicken quesarito ended up being beef,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Getting a bag of cold food tonight really put the chill to the icing on the cake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Order placed: four crunchy tacos with sour cream added and a supreme beef burrito,Received three crunchy tacos no sour cream and a bean burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was so fun eating a full meal of basically terrible food for $1,Yeah there's the Dorito taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for hours ever since because they gave me the lovely gift of food poisoning,I thought I was getting some cheap great tacos ,I can't even think about ever eating a chicken quesadilla again thanks to this Taco Bell location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not sure if they think lettuce ,"but I've paid extra for ""extra"" lettuce ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I sat in the drive thru for 20 minutes before giving my money OR getting food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First off I know Taco Bell is not Mexican food,The food was almost ,It tasted somewhat like I would imagine dog food tasting,I experienced one of the most deplorable examples of burrito construction imaginable,Well this morning I experienced the predictable of outcome to a most disgusting and vile burrito experience,The meat ,I ordered a steak Cantina Bell Burrito,It was made with seemingly real ingredients ,The ingredients upon first,Approximately a year ago I experienced a slow systematic decline in the quality of the Cantina Bell menu,and it actually tasted good, taste were utterly,the Cantina menu actually tasted good,,,,,,,
I received a sorry presentation of food,I got all the way home and discovered this monstrosity of food,& dried crusty beans,no meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lady got our order wrong then gave us attitude when she realized she had given us 10 tacos,We definitely could've driven off with 10 tacos ,long story short  maybe if you come to this location around 10pm you'll get extra free tacos cause the people who work there obviously don't know how to read ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29 shredded chicken quesadilla melt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The portion of food is not just,The staff here will give you less food ,If you want a lettuce taco this is the place to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Forget about critiquing the food- we all know it's cheap,junk food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pick-up: by the time my sister got home the food was way too cold,they still pit it on the food,The steak burrito could have been done the exact,didn't have that natural beefy taco taste & texture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco and burritos were very light,One of the burritos was 4-6,So little meat on the tacos we decided that even if it was a one time fluke,on meat, layers of folded flour tortilla with a sliver of ingredients in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They use less quantities for your meal and barely gives out any taco sauce packets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After paying and getting my food,The food was good,I got nachos and two crunchy tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I tried to give them a few chances but EVERY time they forget food,Ordered simple bean burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was delicious, Once or twice the order is incorrect because we always ask for no sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They gave me my money back when I arrived to pick the food up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And since I had waited for a while they compensated me for my time with some complimentary tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just want the food that I ordered ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like volcano burritos without sour,I moved on to plain crunchy tacos,the three taco meal,They gave me tacos,They just have this obsession with sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went with shredded chicken,no sour cream,After a 4 month stint working at Burger King 34 years ago I steer clear of mayonnaise & sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I hurried to the dealership so the food wouldn't be cold,Our food is now cold,They refused to refund or redo the food because now it was cold,Safe to say our two businesses will not be getting food for our sales staff here any longer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All of the carbonated drinks always taste flat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I l ike the bean burritos ,and the crunchy tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's as if someone who has never made food outside of a microwave attempted to make my food,Ordered a cheese quesadilla in the drive thru ,and upon getting home I noticed there was very little cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food wasn't even hot,When my daughter opened her burrito there was a sharp,black plastic sliver piece on her burrito so we took a picture ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had to say something so my food wouldn't touch it ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get home and its a beef soft taco folded in half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Doritos loco tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After getting my food,both my friend and I were feeling very nauseous and were actually sick due to the food we ate,the cheese in my mini quesadillas weren't even melted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It took at least five minutes to receive my food, And when my food was finally ready, She should have at least stayed there to verify the right person took the food,surely that does not meet Taco Bell quality st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had our food ready,the food was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and this time was no exception) just to show them the burrito I had gotten had been a bloody,the hot sauce was all over the entire burrito that I couldn't even unravel the wrapper ,they fix the burrito,but then get to the chips ,and cheese and literally the whole bag besides about 5 chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Expect to spend 20 minutes in the drive thru lane and your food will be wrong,The last couple times I went I finally checked my food before pulling away which of course irritates the person at the window,The food quality itself is typically fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 but the food has been perfect,when I order bean w/cheese burritos 86 the onions ,and red sauce extra cheese it's always perfection for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but dang all I asked was if I could get my 20 dollars worth of food I paid for because I was given 7 dollars worth of it,I just tossed my food in the trash ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why does it take forever to get your food here,Also why is it every time there is a homeless guy sitting in the store with a table full of Walmart food eating every day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cashier was nice so we over looked it but when our food was wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Sometimes the food takes a while,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We pulled up at 10:30 pm and were told they were out of food,Just that they were out of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sometimes I gotta have honest to Jeebus JUNK food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had to wait a little for the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When employees are making food they should ask themselves ""Would I eat this",hard taco shells ,and chicken),and dried out ingredients (chalupas,It is as if there is no quality control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Large portions for the normal price,All the ingredients are fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've actually consistently gotten my food faster ordering inside which seems backwards,Cause where else am I gonna get fried chicken with a taco as a side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Walked inside 5 people waiting to order 6 people waiting for food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 the food was pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was talked down to while ordering my food through the drive thru,but I was not about to pay for food served by the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh well it is inexpensive and tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I could have driven 15 minutes to a different location and been home faster with my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My food was cold ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is always consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its cheap and quick food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its the best hangover food on a budget,sometimes you are just hankering for that cheap ass taco filled with seasoned beef -- you don't want a fancy wrapped burrito for $8 you want that ,89$ burrito with cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very overpriced for a taco bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"plus beans"")","""Minus meat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have yet to get my order with all my food in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is terrible,the burritos are smaller than tacos should be,The beans are runny,"there is rarely any ""meat"" on whatever you order",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for three orders of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and yummy food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Absolutely the worst taco bell the meat was old,and looked like rat meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 soft chicken tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All i asked was ""what's in the bfast burrito"" ",i got the Sausage bfast burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just gave the food back ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tasted as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's food that will fill you up quickly ,and we're usually getting food for 2-4,nachos and a cheesy beefy burrito all by himself,eat crunchy taco first,Chicken soft taco heats up much better than crunchy one,For lunch from here I usually get a chicken soft taco ,and a crunchy taco,I save my chicken soft taco for later ,the crunchy taco instead - bad,I was not impressed by the volcano taco,Do they think Sam is eating 3 crunchy tacos,a chicken soft taco,a double decker taco,[1] My college standard order was a Mexican Pizza with no beans and a crunchy taco,[1] My college standard order was a Mexican Pizza with no beans ,but reliable) quality delivered,,,,
and the food is as to be expected from Taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a crunchy taco (at noon mind you) which came out flat,as a pancake with barely any meat in it ,The cheese was already melted,and no lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Doritos and taco,Hell all they had to do is make the taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The people are always nice here but I feel like the food is a bit subpar,This time our tomatoes were frozen on our tacos,Last week our chalupa Wrap tasted dry ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is,This is not a review of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went around their corner to the window and there was someone getting food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our food was lukewarm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The tacos were also not very nice,The worker was not polite and we didn't get our chicken quesadilla ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered and received my food in 3 minutes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice staff and quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also didn't get my burrito that was ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice bit of heat to them and they taste so good with the nacho cheese dip that is served with them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My issue with this taco Bell is that they ALWAYS forget things,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was prepared horribly ,The box of hard tacos my husb,The place was completely dirty with literally lettuce everywhere ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco Bell is a great place to go get tacos I live right by it so it's great,to go some times I get the Doritos shell or just get a regular soft shell I like to do Rito shell because it has lots of taste Taco Bell has a great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food came fresh,All the food was pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How can y'all demand better pay if you can't even make a damn bean and rice burrito,How hard is it to make a bean and rice soft taco,Just beans and rice,Beans and rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they give me old food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got home and the food wasn't even hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you will realize how disgarsting the food really is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a salad and it was presented to me in the fashion of a shaken up bowl,""" I said for the salad that you just sold me that I am expected to eat with my h",So to anyone who enjoys eating their salad with a spoon I would highly recommend visiting this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all I really want is to get in and out with some cheap food,- Inexpensive burritos ,and tacos,but it doesn't taste very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I could not go more than several seconds without swatting them out of my face or off my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you imagine a burrito without beans,this time it was beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had to repeat a simple two taco order three times in the drive through,That's code for the person taking the order having extraordinary difficulty putting in an order for two standard menu item tacos,My no doubt cold two tacos were already waiting for me,along with an attitude that made me decide to just let them keep their cold tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a 3 taco meal with a baja blast,You ordered 2 cheese tacos,and not the tacos,But two cheese tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what we got was nearly empty taco shells,minimal meat,The Mexican pizza had barely any meat on them both,lettuce etc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff is friendly and they LISTEN when I order my food,You can substitute ANYTHING in your food,I usually sub black beans for my protein,instead of animal meat,cheese,"Order ANY menu item as ""fresco"" and there will be no dairy in it (sour cream",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We get food from here maybe once a week,Quality of the food is consistent,but because it is fast and very cheap (cheesy double beef burrito =, On one occasion I got to my wife's workplace and realized we had gotten two extra volcano tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other than the nasty taco cabana down the road this is about as fair,decent tacos you will get in the area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28 minutes to food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The meat looked like dog food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As if the food wasn't bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but were all over my food,Why even ask if my screen is correct if the food isn't made the way I asked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not even worth the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Since we've been here for the beverages I began picking up little things here and there like crunchy tacos ,I can't say I've been a fan of Taco Bell ever but this summer was so unbearably hot and when they were offering the slushies for 'Happy Hour' prices, I also like the chicken cantina bowl which feels more meal like to me,and chicken quesadillas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got my usual 2 regular tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Say what you will about the food, If you're in the mood for a quick taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Of course Taco Bell isn't authentic Mexican food,Of course you're eating dehydrated pinto beans ,and some yellow strips that no one in their right mind would call cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got food poisoning immediately after eating my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This review isn't about the food or Taco Bell in general,I pulled into the drive-thru at exactly 10AM and didn't get my food until 10:23,and I generally go to this location about once a week to grab a delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always 5/5 at Taco Bell,I had a coupon for any free taco ,and have always gotten any taco I wanted at other,At this location they insisted it was just a soft beef and soft chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you get a steak soft taco with just lettuce cheese, and steak ITs WRONG,well if you pull up it's ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was meh,I'm not expecting gourmet but when they hardly fill the tortilla w/ beans or ground beef ,and stack it with lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  Nobody including the manager could explain to me why they were charging me more money than the advertised price on their board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"expectations other than fast and accurate service and pray the food is ""decent",The food is mediocre,stop by this location for a little taco/burrito action ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went to this taco bell few days ago and to be honest price and food is ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Taco Bell is not real mexican food""",One taco assembler on the line was new and didn't know yet how to make the food,And in the case of the new smothered burrito,It gets the job done for half the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Drove down the road to get food at Jack in the Box instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
especially for a fast-food place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went through the drive through and got my food correct ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But typically this locations is consistent with their food quality ,All the food was cold, and the taco meat was dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a great place to get some cheap food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I'm not going to grade the quality of food,But I shouldn't have to wait 25 minutes for a burrito at a fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are always sold out how do you sell out of a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 After paying for the food we sat for 6 mins to get the food, The Nachos were barely covering the chips , So it was pretty much just chips, Then the steak quesadilla I ordered didn't have steak in the 2 ends, The middle had 6 piece of very small steak, So I didn't get a steak quesadilla like I ordered,only cheese , It was so covered in there sauce that I had to let it all drip out and scrape it because there was no taste other,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered 3 soft tacos,no tacos,and those new chicken roll things,chips,No chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got our food at 8:02pm,food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you do they will surely spit in your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay I can understand how she heard fiesta potatoes when I say grilled stuffed steak burrito with no fiesta (no I can't),So I returned the burrito because it has Fiesta sauce ,Oh adding to the review they don't have the chicken roll ups either they ran out isn't that a br,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Since they reopened the quality has improved drastically,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who cares if the food is even good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordering $26 worth or food ,I try to explain how this is not my problem and I still require sauce for my food,I leave with a total of 8 packets only to find I was so frustrated with this whole ordeal I forgot to count my items and I'm missing 2 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast food is fast,food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I informed them they forgot my cheese roll up for my hungry,No sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Taco Bell screws up my food every time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The meal came with two tacos,Both steak supreme soft tacos,They didn't shy away from providing me a large quantity of steak,The taste was really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What I expect when I go to Taco Bell is decent food served at a decent,It seems you usually end up with less food for more money,I most recently ordered a breakfast quesadilla sub fiesta potatoes for meat,there was plenty of all of the ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
worst ever bad service and the guy making my food through the garbage out in the dumpster ,and didn't wash his hand before he started making food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We choose not pay or eat the food we ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the most disguisting food I ever ate,If they keep hiring these little kids to prep food then be ready,My dog eats better tasting food than this,I'm looking to have a meal with some flavor and not scrap food,The chalupa and the other two tacos broke into pieces upon me picking them up,Next time your in the mood for tacos, just go a few miles yonder for some real tacos at DEL TACO,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a quesadilla and burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast food is always a last,resort and I try my best to avoid it but when you're hungry and in a hurry the only option is horrible food that is over priced,Why can't corporations serve healthy food instead of foods that are bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
treats her customers like her Taco Bell is a gourmet steak house,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why does it take forever to get your food here,Also why is it every time there is a homeless guy sitting in the store with a table full of Walmart food eating every day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We reached the window and paid as we normally would but then we ended up waiting almost 24 minutes before we received the food we ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Same Taco Bell food with some great,One of my only qualms with big food companies is the fact they generally make errors on specially ordered items ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food always tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The tacos aren't creative, No they don't serve fancy ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took entire to long to get our food here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems like every fastfood restaurant that we've been to in this area has a 15 to 20 minutes wait ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bean burrito was not right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food isn't bad, Today I waited 15 minutes for 3 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this place wouldn't have to change any of their food prep to add them to the menu,it's just that the food barely passes for,food,grain of rice, Don't bother looking for the meat,the guts inside are pretty much all the same mushy goo of ingredients,Brands franchises are very much the same in terms of quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food is expired ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited 16 minutes for raw chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
filling snack of three tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We got a lot more food with the deal then if we bought meals,and decent prices,(chicken of fish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There were at least 5 people prepping food,It took almost 20 minutes to get our food,The food tastes fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unnecessary wait for your food whether you go through the drive-thru or go inside,Pretty sure inside that goo was chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she than proceeded to stare at me in a very Uncomfortable/aggressive manner then handed us our food ,The girl in the drive they was very rude I asked her for green salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is packed in the bags with care,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it satisfies my frequent burrito cravings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gladstone and being a huge Taco Bell consumer I always stop and get 2 chicken soft tacos with the grilled,00 per taco to simply have them put the original,The staff is rude almost consistently and the last time I got my over priced tacos the chicken was rock hard, chicken instead of the shredded,chicken on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Size of everything went down and the price of everything went up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And then when you get up to the window and comment that it's taken 25 minutes to get your food order at the window,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited 10min for my food on a drive thru ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always wonder how they run out of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I should of just left the food there cause it was terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the nacho cheese here is not to be trusted,Doesn't taste right to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was avg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We don't have many options for food late at night with this job,they literally put a SLIVER of meat in each thing,And the cheesy Gordita was basically nothing but lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is how long it took for them to give me my food from the time I paid for it, The only reason I got my food is because the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Friendly staff and delivers food into my h,yet delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice,For a dollar you can get refried beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Just what you want to see in a food review, With delicious taco st,ands on every corner at all hours of the night,the only thing sickening about it is how addicted you may become to these affordable AND deliciously,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was a good wait to actually get my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always good,The food was good,a steak cantina bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tried to keep it healthy by getting taco salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
once they ran out of beans ,and the tortilla taste like they have gone bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went there today and ordered dinner for two people none of our order came out correctly the worst part when I bit into my burrito was it had guacamole in it I am highly allergic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I was so furious that I made them keep their food, I enjoyed my food as I always do ,I was back in the neighborhood this afternoon and a crazy longing for the Taco Bell Burrito Supreme and a taco overcame me - one of my fave,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the rest of the food was nothing like Taco Bell we have eaten in SW Portland,most of it was lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Breakfast review: sausage burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not rating TB food,we all know it's cheap & delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A given is you will wait at least 5-7 minutes in the drive thru (10-15 if it's busy) and you better check your food before you pull off because you have a better chance of winning some money off a scratch-off,I went back after my friend drove to mcdonalds for her food,"After 10 minutes of standing by the counter and being told ""your food will be out shortly"" about 4 times",they come out chicken chalupas,They said they mixed up a beef order and a chicken order ,First bite was all shell and sour cream ,and lettuce,Second bite tastes not like beef,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two stars because I am forever enamored with the bean burritos + extra onions - my college drunk food of choice,"If anyone in Austin visits Taco Bell and orders the new ""Cantina"" tacos","The carnitas ""Cantina"" taco was a soggy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They just told me they are out of steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I also wrote in to Taco Bell about my experience ordering 3 tacos,inside and having to ask for a refund after 20 min with NO apology from the manager that people were getting chicken family dinners before I could get 2 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was at the top of the line from all my thous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and we always buy the boxes of taco's,but at this location we just got all our taco's thrown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Then I bit into my ""bean burrito"" to notice I chomped into lettuce ",I thought that it might be some scraps that made their way in my burrito ,My receipt even stated that I ordered a bean burrito so I don't underst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the Taco Bell located inside Altamonte Mall food court,but this was the only one serving tacos that day,Sometimes you just crave tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some of the entrees are low in fat and calories and taste great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burritos,tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Avoid any food item with potatoes in it,Any kind of burrito you order from here will fall apart on you instantly because they don't know how to wrap it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not expecting gourmet food ,leaving me to think it was out in the food intentionally, I filed a complaint with the city and saved the remaining part and non-food item in it,unless you like eating things that are not food,"""Come back and we will remake your taco",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why can't you make more beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I am not exaggerating when I say the tacos are empty,taco shells also the the double,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had to wait in line for 25 minutes for 3 tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
while my date had one too plus the cheesy bean and rice burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They seem a little overpriced for fast, I wish the ubiquitous sour cream wasn't included by default, If you don't like sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5) Crunchy tacos ,2) Always get sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He told us they were short staffed and it would take about 15 minutes for our food which was okay with us,Our food was tossed to us ,Once we got home the crunch wrap supreme was missing half the hard shell and the cheese was all on one side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the steak taco salad looked half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and spent 25 minutes waiting for food,but they really skimp you on the food at this location,I had to do the most horrible thing you could ever do to Taco Bell food: [re]heat it in the microwave,Expect your taco to have half of it's normal,I got a taco straight out of the freezer,or to be missing a few ingredients,and they don't get cheap on you with the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got the veggie crunch wrap supreme and Doritos locos and have never tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Good food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheesy potato burrito with lava,So now I place a new order for the new xxl steak  burrito(order 304633) with baja sauce,I get back to work and the damn burrito had no steak or sauce on it,soft taco,The sauces were all wrong and the soft taco was a hard,shell taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yup -- those crispy twists of puffed corn really did the trick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as its pretty obvious proper care wasn't exercised with food safety on my order,I've never had a case of food poisoning this bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I even ordered the double decker shredded chicken & it surpass my expectations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheap food in a strip mall,No more or less expensive than any other taco smell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food looks like it is old,If you want something quick at the food court in the Altamonte Mall then stop by in here ,but if you want something better I would suggest another place to eat at the food court,I orderd the 99 cents nachos and cheese and a plain soft taco for my nephew ,and the nachos barely had any cheese and had any tortillas the taco looked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went there last night through the drive thru and was rushed as i was trying to give my order then when i got home i checked my food to see that i was given the wrong,food,No more taco hell from this place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even just their $1 bean rice and cheese burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Asked for 9 supreme tacos ,We went back and told them to remake them and in return we get several tacos still not supreme,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(hours) old food,read it back and chatted at the window until my food was ready,it didn't even have a dollop of sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cashier can't even do his job correctly and the tacos were all crushed or soggy by the time I got it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I thought I was getting fast-food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but a crunchy taco takes me back to being a kid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They give u stale food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food came out good,if you work in the food industry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am not that big a Mexican food person to pay over five bucks,they also get the food out fast ,you can get a taco,but there is very little meat in the tacos,Prices are affordable,but you can get chicken or steak as well,drink and chips for $2,Nothing wrong with their meat IMO,Lately TF has been skimpy on the meat anyway,,,,,,,,,,,
a quesadilla and burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food wasn't too bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fine, The floor is dirty with food all around, It makes me wonder how clean it is in back where they make our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They ran out of taco shells first, They offered to give soft tacos in place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but this is a five-star taco-bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but instead I got two bean and cheese burrito supreme,I just wanted 2 crunchy tacos,I was charged for two crunchy tacos,but did not get two crunchy tacos,Opened the other and saw some sort of meat product in there,It's around the corner from my office,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the usual cheap filling food, Not real Mexican food, I tried their chicken rolled tacos,with good chicken inside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taco Bell is good food that is very unhealthy,a table had food ,Service is quick and prices are cheap,but delicious,They have messed up our order and in return we got a free thing of Cinnamon Twists which are delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How you going to advertise nationally advertise free los tacos for world series stolen base ,but the employees have to say regional said we can only do regular tacos,I want my Doritos taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After paying for my food,Ordered a bean burrito with jalapeno,Bean burrito is filled about half of what it usually is, sauce and chicken quesadilla,Quesadilla has less than 10 pieces of chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I said we didn't have a car and this was our closest option for food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The store was also pretty dirty with a lot of food bits on the floor ,The one plus was the food was warm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food i ordered the 5 dollar box with the nacho,fries the tacos where soggy like they heated them up in the microwave ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I couldn't tell if the other people waiting were there ordering or just waiting for food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service staff were really nice but half the food I paId for isn't in my bag,and the crispy tacos were soggy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We still wanted the food so I went into the restaurant to order,for fear the man might spit in my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why would I pay EXTRA for steak,& get less steak than usual,I ate almost half of this not even knowing if I actually got steak at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10 minutes drive thru for 2 tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ended up unwrapping all the tacos in order to see which were the supreme,Ordered nachos and they were disgusting the cheese had a bad, taste told the manager ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food came out fast ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food order cost 20% more then any Taco Bell I have gone to in Portland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The prices are not increased for no reason like the other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was ok, but super slow and came out luke warm(the cheese in my five layer burrito wasnt even melted),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The girl tells me there's no way that she can cancel the order and instead she goes ahead and sets it up in the system as she's preparing my food,I get a phone call and they say they don't have enough meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The wait time is soooo long and they skimp on the ingredients for the potato soft taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a 5 layer burrito ,She told me that I was wrong and actually did not order 5-layer burritos,she said that I ordered bean burritos,and I got a tortilla with literally only cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoyed it you should definitely go to this place good tacos,Best taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's not really much you can fault a mall food court Taco Bell for (the lowest of the low of ANY restaurant),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Not to mention you have to wait like 45 minutes to get your food ,  It's not that hard to make a damn taco or burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You all know what the food is like,Garbage and food on the floor ,Still takes over 20 minutes to get our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chips and shredded chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food spoiled this whole, but everything tasted like h,  My friend said it tasted like they were eating perfume, The taste of something fragrant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No naked chicken chalupa last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
friendly and great service with a smile and my food looked ,I never had the mini chicken ,I will definitely order just the chicken as it taste better,and tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A very hilarious Taco Bell where they will flat out lie to you and tell you they are out of food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I walked to the counter and ordered one Chicken burrito for $0,I like the chicken burrito,but today chicken made me happy,Usually I'm always leaning towards the beef and red meat,they tasted delicious,cheap and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 bean burritos,We ordered a 3 taco supreme,1 bean soft taco,2 breakfast tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last time it was beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She handled off my food didn't say anything just went on to talking,a number 10 with the tacos upgraded to the supremes,until I got home and the drink was tasteless (not her fault) and I did not get the upgraded tacos I paid for (eh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't receive sauce or sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and not the food,I ordered 2 bean burritos there,The bean burritos came out good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i have a set of twins one does not prefer meat ,To make matters worse the Nacho Boxes they did replace were given to me with the lightest portions of actual meats ,and cheese i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After a long ass double on a Saturday sometimes I just wanna pick up a few tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesn't upset my stomach and I have never got food poisoning from them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finally started to eat and they gave me a bean and rice burrito instead of 7 layer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I food was terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess I'm done paying full price for only have of my food,Those tacos were my goto until they did away with them,Then they come out with a 12 pack Nacho Supreme taco's that turned into my favorite,either they forget to count the tacos or they check-out ,and your lacking filler in the tacos,I can make cheaper tacos at home,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
answered my questions about a taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then we wait patiently for our food for about 10-15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted like a day old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The manager said that we'd have to re-order and sit through the entire line just to get the food we'd already waited for 30 minutes for at a ""fast","food"" restaurant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Long wait for ""fast"" food",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went through the drive thru for two items: a fresco style crunch wrap and Doritos locos taco,The meat on the locos taco was so liquid-y,that the taco fell apart like you see in the pic,Barely any meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food is not good,When you receive your food you can right away see ,and tell that they didn't care if they make it food or not or presentable,If you can go to another do that because this one sucks with there food ,So the next couple times I went again and I asked them if they could please spread out the sauce and everything and everything in the Taco because everything in the taco was in one spot in the middle,So I asked them the next time I came and still the same thing and they put barely any sauce when I paid extra for it and of coarse it's all in the middle only and every time I ate there and asked for them to spread the meat ,and sauce and everything around they said ok but still I got it all in the middle and it just taste bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quality food,where all other Taco Bells we have to recount all of our food to make sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Sadly if was the damn manager who was making what they want to call food, Grilled stuffed burrito couldn't even be picked up you wrapped it so loosely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My favorites are the bean burrito which I love with the ""Fire Sauce"" ",I always eat the Crunchwrap first then a bite of the bean burrito ,The bean burrito heats up nicely in a microwave the next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My sister and I went there last night and ordered taco salads ,and they failed to put the salsa in the bag not to mention,I found plastic in my salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ive been waiting for 20 minutes and my food isnt ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ask foe extra cheese on my taco's, Tonight I got 6 taco's ask for extra,And sometimes there's hardly any cheese in the Taco at all come on really cheese in this is  essential to make a taco come together,And I never get extra cheese , cheese didn't get it ,70 for extra cheese I didn't get,You charge for extra cheese ,and yet don't give extra cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,
They give you all lettuce and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not to mention my chicken quesadilla was swimming in the sauce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
missing a 'green apple freeze' food was cold,They put 12 tacos ,and and a taco salad in a small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a horrible place to get food,a young white female named (Hannah) and an older Hispanic male just standing around not prepping food while we were ordering,the female was on her phone answering calls while the Hispanic male was starting to prep food,""" At that time we were completely over it waiting for about 20-30 minutes to receive our food while they (3 people) cussed ",When we got home we started eating the food was cold,a burrito,after a few bites of the burrito I found a plastic,and a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,
but at this specific location i literally got a sack of cheese with lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was the middle of the day with no line my food should have been right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My friends got their food 20 minutes later,still no food for me,with my food nowhere in sight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My food was fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't know when was the last time they cleaned it  and the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- 30 minutes waiting for our food in the drive thru line,gotten my food,- ordered a double crunch wrap and got some thing that resembled a deconstructed burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the tacos were terrible,I ordered a 3 crunchy taco meal ,least filled tacos I have EVER received in my entire,Check out the photo of a very sad taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was poorly put together ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What is the protocol when serving food how old,I orderd two potato tacos , I bit into my taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go here frequently and usually they get my food wrong,Just give me my food,beans etc) she gives me a kids nachos,It's ok because it's Taco Bell but if I ask for nachos I'm not wanting chips ,loaded (in other words with meat ,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and no food was brought out to the people waiting inside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I was ordering my food I saw the kitchen filthy,The area where  they were prepping the food was filthy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I got my food for free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 of which were the same thing but he entered them incorrectly (the cheesy Gordita crunch with the nacho cheese shell - ordered exactly that way,but were entered as if I ordered nacho cheese on top of them),Plus he charged us for adding the nacho cheese sauce (,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She Fl gives me my food in a box ,I couldn't get it Bc they have no bowls,What a waste of bags that could probably buy the bowls,Barely any meat or quac or salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It came with a burrito,I'll get another burrito supreme ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The manager at this store at thet dinner @ 6:15 was very rude & incompetent when giving prices of particular,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for four black bean tacos ,I returned to the counter and informed I ordered black beans,he made them again and they were refried beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
extreme red tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and when we got home with our food,He also didn't give us the mild taco sauce he asked us if we wanted ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Cold food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a Nacho Fries Bell Grande and 2 supreme tacos,Then I opened one supreme taco (barely anything in it) the other,Never received the tacos so I paid for 2 supreme,tacos without having it fixed, was full but was missing the shedded cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My daughter orders a taco ,We pull up to the window and he hands us the taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the food I wanted,I get the food home ,You got my money and I got no food,3 tacos,I paid also for all those items to have extra meat in them too,every single item has no meat in them at all,2 chalupas and 1 steak quesadilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food is not good,When you receive your food you can right away see ,and tell that they didn't care if they make it food or not or presentable,If you can go to another do that because this one sucks with there food ,So the next couple times I went again and I asked them if they could please spread out the sauce and everything and everything in the Taco because everything in the taco was in one spot in the middle,So I asked them the next time I came and still the same thing and they put barely any sauce when I paid extra for it and of coarse it's all in the middle only and every time I ate there and asked for them to spread the meat ,and sauce and everything around they said ok but still I got it all in the middle and it just taste bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We went through Taco Bell we gave them a very special order they got it all right I loved eating a taco ,and sucking the sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was the Taco Belliest taco Bell I have ever been in,and therefore unable to make tacos,That struck me as odd given that taco is right,and they neglected to give me any utensil for the salad that I ordered in the drive-through,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I hope this is a fixable problem because I am a cool ranch taco junkie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was poorly made,workers were extremely rude and refused to give me sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We came here about 4 days ago the morning shift was rude didn't offer any deals and when I found the deal she say "" here you go changing everything"" we received food with an attitude ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poor food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We were the only people inside and they gave us regular burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight I ordered inside with only one person in front of me and it took 15 minutes for a grande nacho box and soft taco,(Ordered no sour cream) ,new nachos was half the size of the one they added the sour cream to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They just handle your card and your food ,I will definitely not be coming back to this location again if I have to wait a long time for food to come out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they were out of burritos or the wraps for them ,They were out of hard and soft taco shells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We waited 15 minutes for our food for it to be completely wrong,The tacos that we got were a complete,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Made my  food sloppy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I swore I would not fall for gimmicky food,limited time food items ,is it the official snack food of the EMO crowd, Is it the new designer food of the Goth kids, The innards of the taco (yes,but they used a pepper-jack cheese ,innards is an acceptable word) was your usual swath of re-hydrated beef and lettuce, I tried the black shell alone first but could not discern any different or new tastes, However it still tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,
We're super disappointed for not double checking their quality control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Umm I ordered nacho grande and I got 3 small bags of chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've relied on food delivery a bit more than usual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The steak in the quesadilla is dry/stale and there are things literally just missing from a burrito  (red,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
service was appalling and they totally over charge for terrible food,00 order and waiting an absurd amount of time for the order of 6 value tacos,6 VALUE tacos cost $10,close to the same price ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered Uber eats and got $50 worth of food,The delivery was amazing but the food was not,We were missing an item and the food was not up to par to other,The cinnamon twists had an after taste of plastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The two tacos were an afterthought,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However food was a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We Did not  feel comfortable ordering my food from here so we left right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered a burrito without cheese,it had cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Taco Bell has the best Vegan 7 layer burritos (fresco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""what happened to real mexican food",""" I came here asking for a Bean cheese burrito",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just didn't feel the quality was up to par versus other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
beans) with that,And the nacho cheese here is not to be trusted,Doesn't taste right to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ordered 4 steak power bowls ,and added chicken,they added the chicken alright ,And still charged me the extra $5 for adding chicken,but removed the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The drinks are a hit or miss cause half the time they just taste like seltzer water,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but today was the 3rd time over the course of two months that they did not have tortillas or rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 No cinnamon twists the first order and tonight no cheese for the nachos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however it took like 15-20 min for me to get one taco and one burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well I ordered food thru,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is pretty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was typical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The $1 premium burritos they are offering now are super,There were more chip crumbs than there were chips,we paid the 80-cent upcharge for the steak nachos,and we literally got three pieces of steak,but I counted the pieces of steak,is the consistency in the flavor and the quality of the product,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but not only from this day's attempt but also a former attempt that resulted in incorrect order and seriously poor food quality + underweight in size,I know when the 7-layer burrito used to be $0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seemed very annoyed I made any changes to my order(taking off beans),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This spot is rude refuses customer service and says I'm rude and I treat them all with respect call them ma'am sir and all pull up to the window and tell me they are not accepting my service cause I was rude to employees who have an attitude have gotten sick from they food a couple times me ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered a ton of food here ,and burritos,tacos,a steak quesorita,The Baja blast was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered our food had to have it fixed ,My nacho supreme had no cheese ,was cold and had no cheese between the folds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for bean and cheese burritos ,How are you out of refried beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one time i was choking on my own spit and actually died for 3 min in the drive thru as i was waiting for my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mostly due to the lack of nutritional value as well as the quality of both the preparation and the ""food"" itself",But then I instantly am reminded that the food NEVER looks as it does on the menu board,Unfortunately service here isn't much better than the food,you at least expect to get the items you ordered ie: chicken on a chicken bowl or cheese on a combo burrito,I recently found myself craving a good ol' fashion crispy taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very unhappy with their service and they made me wait to get my drinks for another 10 minutes after I finally got my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My last 10 visits or so the food was always Luke warm ,I ordered the new grilled cheese burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
black taco shells or nuttin,beans & rice base layer, Next time Ill ask for no rice,pico) and the chunks of citrus chicken, I could actually taste the chicken,corn salsa, No cheese wiz,like something made out of fresh lettuce with real,The chef lady salad thing was sorta good, I ate something at Taco B that didn't taste AT ALL like Taco B,,,,,,,,,,
this is not how it works) and they couldn't give me food without the order coming through,but giving me the food would be the same,as giving out free food,All J did was stonewall the entire conversation and work to keep a paying customer from getting their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They got my order right but the quality of food is what you would expect at Taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This one always takes minimum 10-15 mins to get your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One gal prepping food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the tacos are mostly tortilla,The owners need a complete rehab of management and quality control at this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
end food ,We came to grab a rare 'fast food' couple of tacos ,and fiesta taco salads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they were out of chicken & all fountain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Every time I ask for ""No Cheese"" they repeat the order ""no cheese"" ",and I still get cheese,It even says no cheese on the receipt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had to ask for a bag because the boxes even had food all over,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our food is aways up fast ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Three stars based solely on the customer service and not the food,If only the food matched the quality of the service this would be a much,My food was cold, and the taco shells were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Get tacos with rice,black beans,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service was ok and the food was ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also charged us for items we didn't want when we went back to get the food that we paid for ,And then gave us a receipt with additional food that we were charged for ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because whatever random food is in there will have to do, I won't come back to get my correct order after your hair brain demanded $15 an hour employee can run my food through the gutter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They somehow did something to it to give it an overpowering bitter taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All i asked was ""what's in the bfast burrito"" ",i got the Sausage bfast burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burritos are not wrapped properly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not everyone likes to eat Mexican foods,Taco Bell is more American style foods,I have tasted the Baja Blast drink,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went three times in two months both times out of taco meat ,The last time the manager Lily stated she could stretch the meat to make the 12 taco party meal, So you don't have enough but can complete my order with out enough meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also gave me a beef quesarito when I ordered a chicken one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The last time they gave my vegetarian girlfriend food filled with beef which happened to be our last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Mexican pizza was stale and the bean burrito had old, beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can honestly say that this is one of the worst tacos bells I have ever been too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was disgusting, The meat was so dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more food than i could eat by myself,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- I've never had problems with the food here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The store is not the cleanest but the prices are good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not necessarily leaving a review for the food (although it was good,but he really showed that he is a truly caring person when a lady came in asking for a free taco because she had no money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ingredients are old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and worst of all there was this big piece of plastic I just found in my bean burrito-disgusting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Probably one of the best bean and cheese burritos in a very long,not just lettuce like some locations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today for the second time in a row my cheesy bean and rice burrito didn't have rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it took 25 minutes for 3 burritos that were 90% rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vinchenzio in the morning shift team taco associate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It meets my diabetes diet and food tastes good,We started going here for their veggie bowl with taco meat ,and extra cheese minus rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been to this tacobell multiple,and it's definitely an average tacobell,I've been there a few times where they'd be out of something ridiculous like lettuce or beef,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very bad attitudes and the food was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even frozen dinners are better than eating what this place passes on as ""food",Not only was all the food room temperature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They took back the quesarido and took out the steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's 7 measly packets & the butt end of my burrito is dry,"then proceeded to ask for ""hella mild sauce"" when I got to the window bc today was hard enough & I just wanted two bomb cheesy bean & rice burritos to finish my day",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cheesy rice and bean burritos were only so-s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From getting good customer service to even getting all of your food the first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was awesome, - got 2 fresh Doritos Locos tacos & a loaded,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's cheap food that could potentially come at a grave cost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We used to pick up food here quite often,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I visited the drive thru yesterday and the food was  awful,it was completely deflated and the lettuce was mushy so it's obvious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We dropped in on a cold crisp Wednesday early evening I ordered an Enchirito and a double decker Supreme taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
