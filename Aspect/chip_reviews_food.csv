I especially love the the guacamole that they make at Chipotle,It's almost as good as guacamole in Mexico,it never fails to taste amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,hands down my favorite place to go for a burrito bowl,quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I told him over and over that it was okay and he didn't need to worry but he continued to push and then got me a free burrito card (not complaining) however the young,thanks for the free burrito though,The first of my last two experiences I had a bowl,the black bean was running low but they just decided to scrape up all the goop of the beans and put it in my bowl anyway,I was having another bowl ,They're always out of black beans,they had zero black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered steak burritos ,We ate our burritos in the dining room which was filthy,what I do know is we spent over 40 bucks on mediocre burritos,but the steak was full of tendons and the meat itself was tough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband had steak and I had chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was so tasteless,Last of all  e-coli diarrhea was they way I felt after paying good money for poor service and tasteless food,I was so happy when I found that this chipotle was opening in my neighborhood,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I haven't found any Mexican food in the south that satisfies,I ordered a steak burrito with white, rice ,I'd rather go to Mo's where I can get chips for free and a choice of different salsas,and had them add some guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A/C broken but the food is ok,one of the ppl working there told me the air was broken for almost 2 weeks I will not go back into the A/c is fix this is not a 3rd world country  if so can I get third world price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your burrito is always gargantuan by the time they have to wrap it up,a local chipotle that's walking distance,This chipotle functions pretty st,The menu is pretty standard and like all other chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My latest Pro tip for Chipotle is asking for my taco shells on the side,I love the crunchy taco shells ,So I asked them to put the shelves on the side and basically I get a bowl and tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The usual chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 That sour cream and cheese topped on my salad,This is my go to fix when I'm craving a to-go salad, I should really check how many calories are in the salad sauce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I order a bowl with double, steak (which costs extra,) there isn't double steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steak burrito bowl is great and unlike a few other locations I don't find the food oversalted,I've never run into a problem with me wanting the steak that is being cut up instead of the older steak in the pans (so much better),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love purchasing Chipotle cards for people to turn them onto the food fresh,food served here,this time for food,The only reason not 5 stars was because I did not purchase food,which I am quite sure I will give them that 5 stars rating once I have tried the food,They have the most amazingly fresh housemade guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today's visit chips are stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't think the food is 5 stars,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They put barely any rice in my bowl,it's rice,I would give this location a 5 but they really skimp you on the bowls, And it's not just the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not the best chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only am I always satisfied with my food,but they happily fixed me my tacos and even gave me a free burrito coupon for next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff is wonderful and food is always delish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I shouldnt have eaten the burrito,Worst chipotle ever,bad balance of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food they use is quality,and most important - fresh food,The crew was very eager to serve me and the manager came and asked how my food was,And the burritos,The tacos,I'm a huge fan of the chicken or carnitas tacos with no rice or beans,Update - writing this review made me hungry for tacos so I went over there for lunch,mild salsa,sour cream and cheese,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A steak Burrito bowl, If I am going to spend on the extras and spend $14 on a Burrito bowl,extra steak , The last time have of my steak was chunks of fat,and the steak was overdone ,and by far the quality of this location is the worse,I would expect a little better quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It would take 45 minutes to get a burrito, I ordered and received a burrito that was smaller than my hand, If I'm going to risk my health to eat a burrito,I want the burrito to be the size Chipotle burritos are supposed to be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and Gary was very nice as well he remembered what I usually ordered and when I told him I  wanted to try something new he  let me sample the other meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been there a few times and each time the meat has tasted old (chicken ,30 for 10 chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Their food is always fresh, and delicious no matter which one I go to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was tossed around,like I was there begging for food,Last night I went to this chipotle  because I didn't want to drive the extra,10minutes to the Decatur one (I wish I would have) I was getting off my 12 hour shift from the hospital and was looking forward to buying chipotlet,Trust me there are many other chipotles ,Everyone except the girl who served the rice,",beans","she asked ""what's going in this"" instead of asking ""what would you like"" then she would slam a huge amount of let's say for example mild salsa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Want some actual food , Fast food ,but are in a hurry come get a rice bowl w beef ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hope the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The OG chipo - really doesn't need many words - gotta love a good burrito bowl time to time - just don't forget my dressing with my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because your food is so good,The food's so delicious,The burritos,Your tacos so soft,chipotle,The bowls are also quite the treat,and your chicken so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got the chicken burrito which began with a huge,Then I went to get a burrito for someone else ,Got a burrito bowl with no tortilla,with chips and tortilla included in the price of the burrito , scoop of WHITE rice ,I should have stopped them at the rice,AND a salsa bar ,Had to pay for chips (what, Moe's is even better although their meat is dry and chips are stale,You get of choice of sour cream OR cheese (what ,and saw that corn was a filling option,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even the burritos here seem smaller then any other,Seriously like 3/4 a scoop of rice,They were out of steak the other,Instead of letting the people behind me that ordered nothing with steak proceed down the line,So for amount 5 minutes the line did not move and ended up to the door just because they couldn't figure out to let people not ordering steak to proceed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today will be the second time this month that they have to remake my food ,Just because I'm not waiting in line like others doesn't mean you can skimp on food,My boyfriend's burrito had no meat ,when I paid for a chicken burrito ,and my bowl was missing things I asked for,especially since I ordered double steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a chicken burrito ,I love Chipotle but this location seems to burn the veggies and meat consistently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is some good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They literally saved my life - I ordered 50 burritos to go ,Job well done - best chipotle team I've ever seen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff is very friendly and takes extra good care of your burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay chipotle almost had me this time everything tasted AMAZING,but the girl put a half scoop of rice in my bowl,the rest of the topping were perfect but the rice,Then the guac had two shell peels in it :/ but the toppings all tasted so amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's usually not crowded (unless you go around noon) and the food is almost always delicious,My only complaint is about guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle always works fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband ordered are food through the mobile,He ordered myself a bowl and a burrito for him,they had a bowl for him,chips ,no chips or drinks,There is so much cheese on mine its not edible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and my carnitas burrito just tastes better than I expected,Friday lunch crew - your burrito game is on point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is so tasty,The bf and I share bowls and there's always more than enough food for us both,The ingredients are fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 A woman in front of me wanted fajita veggies on her burrito which, And the chips are always stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love me so burritos from this place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well the food was good, but the judgmental queens taking cash and passing out the guacamole and chips need to be talked to about how to treat customers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is decent, When we went to pick up the food, Though on the pricier side (versus Anna's and other burrito joints),some of the employees at this Chipotle need to get a crash course in burrito wrapping,but I always opt for the burrito bowl - so no complaints here, The manager gave us a few free burrito coupons to thank us for waiting,but we weren't gonna pass up free burritos,75 for guac on your burrito is silly,A mockery to the burrito,how much guac are you giving me in my burrito,How can you have a burrito with no guac, (Though one co-worker gripes that the tomato salsa is too onion-y,I find the ingredients to always be fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd say I'm disappointed every time I come into this chipotle even if ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a great chipotle,fresh tasting ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food stations are a complete,For example: today I ordered a bowl with guac,but instead of guac I got cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think the food is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but good for a quick food grab,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The b team came in that night and ruined my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I eat at chipotle on a weekly,lettuce  and white rice,no guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have gone to this place multiple times and every time the portions of the food seem to be getting smaller,But lately I find myself not wanting go to this place due to the quantity of food received,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You get a lot of food for the price,The to go containers are nice foil containers that kept the food warm for the 5-10,My only real complaint about the food is that you can't get rice without cilantro,On this visit I ordered a carnitas burrito bowl with soft, taco shells on the side,but I'd love to be able to get cilantro-free rice,Usually I can get past it with all the other great flavors in the bowl,I have ordered chips ,but I don't like that chips are extra,Maybe I just don't understand the work that goes into making the chips,and guacamole in the past,although I understand charging for the guacamole,There is a portion of the human population that has a genetic distaste for cilantro,It tastes like soap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered on my chipotle app ,and they forgot the chicken which I paid for,a different cashier hit me in the face with a bag of chips,They did make it right by hooking it up with a free salad on my next,I keep going back because I love the salads they serve,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Further the steak that was served in my rice bowl was in large,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food isn't even that fresh,and they're always out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is a pretty good place to try Mexican food,and the taste is different from the food I usually have,I ordered a bowl with rice,but really delicious,but the beef is easy chewing and the black beens have good aftertastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go to this location 1-2 times a week and sometimes the burrito wrapping is sub,Overall a above average chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a steak burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always good,This is my normal chipotle location ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
09-since I don't eat rotten food,I asked for avocado with the usual rice chicken etc meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Between that and the parent company's questionable food safety history,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" I just love how quick and delicious their food is",A tiny bit pricey ,but it's super delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have a 95 food service  grade which is a plus,and they have done  away completely with GMO foods which is one of the main,The food is so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Besides the great service the food is also very well as the other,My story starts Sunday night I went to this location walking home from work(market basket) I was in a hurry to get home but couldn't resist a nice burrito,So I go order my burrito ,He decides to give me my burrito completely for free, employees burrito wrapping skills ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went to this chipotle recently to get myself ,and my girlfriend each a bowl,I was excited to see the guy hook up the person in front of me with two huge scoops of chicken and I was so surprised I thought for once I was gonna have a fat bowl,when he got to ours he gave us each a small scoop of chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Same food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is definitely worth it's money as you get more than enough food in your bowl, I will take a chance at another location since the food is decent, It was only Wednesday and they didn't have the Fajita vegetable to go in the veggie bowl,especially because I don't eat meat I look forward to having a lot of vegetables in my dishes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They do get a little caught up in food prep sometimes ,and neglect the line but I guess you would be waiting for food prep if everyone was on the line helping,The food was great,I'm so glad to have a chipotle in my hood,I get bad grissle chicken once in a while at all of the locations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Both were bowls and we added 1 order of hard and soft taco shells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Did I try some of the guac and chicken bowl leftovers of my friend's ,Guac was surprisingly decent  ( only reason this place gets a 3rd star )  and the bowl was edible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food has been very consistent,I keep craving these burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sixteen bucks for food that's not only unappealing to look at - ,I stopped in Sunday evening to pick up 2 burritos,I ordered a carnitas bowl and a chicken burrito,So I'm standing there watching them prep other burritos,I watch a girl scoop out what amounts to water with a few beans on someone's burrito,then drags my burrito across the prep counter - which is smeared with old,My burrito is done,and decide I will simply make my own bowl out of my chicken burrito,First guy in line starts the bowl,) then the bowl sits there while other,A girl finishes the bowl,sees there is no chicken - puts my tortilla on foil back where the guy is about to cut the chicken,It sits there while he sharpens the knife (directly over the pile of cooked chicken - nice,Then the chicken is finally cut,the chicken might at least be WARM,There are little to no beans left, guacamole,lettuce,pulls a bunch of lettuce up off the counter into my foil,Sounds really delicious doesn't it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so unless they start giving food away I don't think this will be a problem,she also makes a mean burrito,I did have some trouble understanding the person who built my burrito the last,the burrito is the main,a burrito bowl (the entire,burrito filling served in a bowl with no tortilla),For vegetarians they do also offer a veggie burrito with guacamole,25 for a chicken burrito is moderate,I've had about 4-5 burritos there now,Nothing comes with the burritos,you don't technically need them with a burrito,if they added a combo where you could get a burrito,They have other options such as tacos,You can choose your own filling including rice,My only major complaint is the value/price,beans (black,salsa,Their mild salsa is a pico de gallo (salsa,I did try the hot salsa,so if you want chips & salsa,so if you want chips & ,chips,and Barbacoa meat filling,cheese,and sour cream,salads,but it was a little too hot for my tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They roll a mean burrito, Their guac is very good and should not be missed with a bag of fresh chips for ~3$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If it's not seasoned the burrito tastes so plain,it's hit or miss if they seasoned the chicken fajita, meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ate one bit of my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm sure the food would have been good,so we literally turned down a quality free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I might not notice the taste inside a burrito,I'm going to comment on the brown rice ,Brown rice has absolutely no flavor,and black beans that I usually get with my kids quesadilla,Ditto for the black beans,The chips here are super,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is pretty good,I like the tacos ,but I don't want to pay extra for chips and salsa,Moe's chips included,Tijuana Flats chips included,.delicious queso,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lady serving the food at chipotle had a bad,atti and made me repeat the Oder several times then she backs annoyed with me very unpleasant meal  I asked for double meat it was a tiny bowl n I was hungr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let me start off with the fact that I am a Chipotle fan - you won't hear me bad talk Chipotle food,you will always get one of the best and freshest burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't care if a burrito has enough,Chipotle is swank decor and ambiance without the swank price,This place is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food served fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 everything is so delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my soft tacos were a squishy,At least the salsa ,and guacamole were tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good food,Good price,ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is edible,"but almost everyone who makes the food might as well have ""my parents made me get this job ",Need to remember to just order to-go food from the Mexican,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get a salad bowl (no rice,  I pay the extra $2+ for guacamole ,no cheese,no sour cream) ,and they're pretty cheap with everything but the lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is usually way over seasoned or cold,I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is great for accommodating food allergies, My favorite thing to get is the carnitas bowl,they will change gloves and bring fresh ingredients out to avoid cross contamination,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I will say the quality of food is great,and I love that they use pasture raised meats and non gmo foods,food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
often without all ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are ok, My biggest pet peeve though is charging for chips and salsa,75 for chips and salsa is a serious,you can get as much salsa as you want, The salads are ridiculously small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like the food at Chipotle ,  So if you order the food with the app be careful,I was then told they had a large order to fulfill and it take over 20 minutes to make 1 chicken burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I realize this location is somewhat new and working in retail/food service myself,reached in and grabbed my burrito which was hardly wrapped at all (there's rice ,If I wanted a burrito bowl I would've been less of a fatty ,If I hadn't been standing there while they made it I would've sworn they had taken a pre-made shittily wrapped burrito out of the fridge ,glacier-cold burrito I've ever had,If you're reading this and have a smart brain and a hungry stomach: avoid waiting in line for an icy cold burrito ,and beans in the bottom of the bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one of the workers the bigger Hispanic woman closer to register at that time gave  me wrong salsa ,The salsas were considerably less tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they over stuffed my burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I loved my bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Still the best chain burrito around in my book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pros: the food tasted fresh,not enough food for the price,My burrito bowl was quite tasty,95) for chips and salsa ,*no_free_chips_and_salsa*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was excellent,the food was too good,got the carnitas burrito, but for some reason when I was talking to the person preparing my burrito,she couldn't do 2 things at once and she ended up messing up my burrito in the middle of preparing it ,My friend got a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the proportion of meat when ordering a bowl or burritos are not consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle store was terrible,the chips were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always order a veggie burrito all the way,It's a burrito place,even though of all the burrito chains,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" so I watched as he prepared 3 food items for someone else right in front of me",The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location is the closest to where I live & unfortunately the food service sucks because they never have veggies available,Once they did not have veggies AND lettuce available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Id say this would be a great place to get a burrito if you're drunk,They asked if i wanted chips multiple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I ordered the burrito bowl with chicken, They give you LOTS of rice,sufficient amount of beans a little meat and a little cheese for a BIG price,very little chicken, And the chicken was very fatty, With as little meat that's given,you would think it would at least be all meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food-super, The place is clean-service great and the food outst,price if you're on a budget,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They don't skimp on your food like other,They always have the food ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I couldn't care less - I am here jst for the food anyway,As for the food itself, There've been a few weeks when I have chipotle 3-4 times a week and I'm never tired of the food,I often go for either the chicken or sofritas (which is a tofu based dish),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I may never come back to this chipotle again,I asked for brown rice,I came back and asked for extra salsa,After taking quite awhile to put the salsa in a cup,the associate straightened the rest of the cups and lids before walking away without handing me the salsa,I had to ask the cashier to hand me the salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice was dry,"While he was ringing me in he was talking to another employee about cleaning the floor he just goes ""chips ",lettuce was soggy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"drove all the way there to find out they are ""out of cheese"" wtf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always good,This location is always running out of food,Last week while preparing my salad bowl 2 of the food prep people ,The remaining food prep person said,We came on a Sunday evening with not much of a line but apparently they ran out of chicken or barbacoa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Same old chipotle as the rest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Regardless the food tasted as consistent,Nothing to complain about when it comes to the taste of the food,It's more about the service and availability of the food items,They didn't have soft tacos,Or corn tacos,We also had to wait for fresh rice because they were scraping the bottom of the silver bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were using a wet cleaning rag on the counter while food was moving down the line,I noticed that the corner of the nasty rag was getting into peoples food now ,Burrito bowl portions are dis-similar,Came with my gal - both ordered chicken bowls ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I tried the lime/pasley rice,but will forego it for just meat & veg next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but hits the pocketbook hard at $10/burrito,I have tried chicken burritos ,and chicken soft tacos at Chipotle,The chicken itself seemed higher quality than Ana's ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- this location is the ONLY food place open,They make a serviceable burrito,then I suggest getting a chicken burrito with the grilled,if someone's buying you lunch and price isn't an issue, veggies and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know food prices are rising,And the food - the burrito was terrible,It's exactly like if you took any one of Boston's familiar burrito joints ,I repeat ONE DOLLAR FIFTY for just a spoonful of guacamole on your burrito,it's a  burrito shack (they have tacos ,45 minute  crawl on 93 North 7 days a week to get to a decent burrito than waste a single, The other review I read mentioned the same thing - how do you make a fresh cold burrito right on the dot at dinner time, I had a surprisingly good late night burrito made by a Chinese,and an equally good one at another burrito joint in Burlington,so it's definitely possible to recreate good burritos anywhere by anyone,taco salad,jacked the prices through the roof,the rice ,"""chicken mole",and beans were tasteless,the meats were bland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I literally was there for over an hour to get 1 single burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Second time I got food poisoning from this place,It tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice was undercooked the guacamole was brown like it had been sitting out since last week and over all the food was not good,They also need to clean there counters where they make the food off more often,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never seen a smaller burrito bowl before,This chipotle is awful,but can't quit chipotle,Regularly out of key ingredients (cheese,) and most recently despite not being out of ingredients they were incredibly stingy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito yesterday was the smallest burrito I've ever had at any chipotle,I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typically it's because the food is only mediocre for what you pay for ,another lady was waiting for food to be re-done,The gal serving up food was literally slopping the ingredients into the bowl ,No wonder a couple people had issues with their food,Almost $17 for two chicken/rice bowls,I place my order but then they run out of chicken,seriously over 5 minutes pass and still no chicken,Other's are waiting for chicken,It was nearly $2 extra to receive a small plop of guacamole on my meal,I asked for no sour cream or cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- Great food as always,but when I sat down with my wife to eat the food I couldn't enjoy the food because the smell was so strong,I worked in food services for four ,That affected the way they served our food,- We waited about 10-12 minutes for our turn to get food,I noticed one of the staff who were helping wrap burritos,pull her pants up (while having her gloves on) and proceeded to continue serving and wrapping burritos with the SAME GLOVES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I come here on a regular basis and the food is consistently good,I'd recommend the barbacoa burrito bowl with all of the fixings (except guacamole because one scoop is about 25% of the price of the bowl),I've noticed that the chicken is usually overcooked ,they won't drain your beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the food is still amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is prepared with love ,If you're not already familiar with Chipotle's food offerings,and I never feel like they're just slapping the burrito together,I'm not usually a fan of burritos,My favorite is their tender chicken burrito on that yummy, tortilla with corn salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Haven't been to Chipotle since the food contamination issues,The food was tasty,with our food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We were all impressed with the quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was still bomb as hell,Got me a chicken burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sad excuse for Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was still great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have never been to a chipotle where I got something I was unhappy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All I ever get is the veggie burrito,rice,Its pretty standard- black beans,anything that's not meat,lettuce,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As I order my food I spoke to the server for one item she gave me another item ,The tables and floors was little dirty look like the security guard was trying to clean the place but in all it still a nice place to eat for the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just a typical chipotle,everything looks and tastes amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered Guacamole and chips,The chips that I still got were unbelievably stale,I was told the guacamole wasn't ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is tasty,but the food is well worth the five minutes that you'll interact with the staff,the staff is a bit rid and I've was played by paying for a side a guac until I found out that it was included with the veggie tacos,Along with the increase in price there seemed to be a decrease of tequila in every glass,You can have your salad topped with beans,salsa ,I also recommend getting a salad with a side of chips if you're a nacho,meat,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is a little bit pricier than a regular burrito ,The guy who was adding a few items and then rolling it for me almost messed up my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get double of everything with half and half meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not to mention that NOBODY can seem to wrap a burrito,I've never gotten a burrito that didn't have to be rewrapped,This is a pretty bad chipotle,"My friends and I call it ""the worst chipotle in the WORLD"" ",but the portions are weird- like they'll give you a tiny bit of rice ,One time I actually counted the pieces of chicken I got ,and an assload of beans,or an assload of salsa with a tiny,I've also noticed that sometimes the chips are all crushed or they're stale, bit of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was also something off about the food ,it wasn't bad food,and it didn't taste like the average chipotle,but I eat at a chipotle a few,I will visit chipotle again ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I don't feel like driving to my FAVORITE chipotle location on South Lamar I'll st,Like all chipotle's they skimp on the portions ,and you have to ask for more rice or beans,Every time I've come here I noticed their chicken ,But most of all quit burning the chicken ,and bell peppers always taste burnt and their ingredients have little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quality was usually consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 But how about this guacamole cup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I am not usually a big fan of chain restaurants and I'm not a big fan of the whole giant burrito pseudo Mexican food thing, There was no way anyone should eat the whole thing- it was a lot of food, I noticed that they avoid chemical stuff in food , I had a burrito bowl- i don't know why it is called a burrito bowl,There is not a HUGE selection of items that you can have added to a burrito/,taco/, It had lime cilantro rice (it was bright, bowl ,and black beans as well as the hot, salsa, The hot salsa was really great, I had guacamole,) and the guacamole was not super,cheese, It tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Half a scoop of chicken for three tacos, I came home and there was 3 tiny little pieces in one of my tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was ,Last week I ordered a burrito on line with guacamole,and when I got to my meeting there was no guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a burrito,The burrito broke,I ordered a bowl,The bowl was the only,and chips ,Paid extra for steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enjoy chipotle a lot,Only negative is how expensive guacamole is getting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always on point ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We come here often but ONLY because we like the food,Really too bad because the food is good,I would give the food a 4 star ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle's Mexican Grill offers excellent customer service and tasty Mexican food that will definitely 'hit the spot,I've never been dissatisfied with the quality of the food,and split a burrito with a friend,Special props for the outstanding guacamole- now if they can only lighten up on the salt for their chips,""" The ingredients are consistently fresh",placing strong emphasis on making sure the ingredients consistently meet customer expectations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,lol like you asking for them to give you more food (to make it an ACTUAL serving size) is going to come out of their own,food is fine,I like chipotle ,I've never had many negative thoughts about chipotle ,but tonight at the ponce location I ordered a bowl and got basically half a scoop of rice & half a scoop of chicken,yet was charged full price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No chicken or steak at around 1pm what the hell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The stuff does not give a damn about the way they make the burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I've ordered online My food is ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only negative thing that I could give chipotle is that the customer service discrepancy between locations,There is literallly nothing better that chicken and rice for me,Most of the time I get the salad bowl with carnitas,green salsa,corn salsa,mild salsa ,Everything works well and tastes delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad bland food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if they messed up your burrito aka break the tortilla whilst wrapping it,if we see that airbubble at the bottom of the burrito burst,"""just a little sour cream please"" the burrito maker always disregards what I am saying ",instead i end up getting 3 fat scoops in turn making my burrito not only destined to pop,any skilled burrito maker should know this,I'd get free burritos for going so much,in Eugene I recognized one of the old managers from the Beaverton one and he hooked me up with a free burrito,but any less would be unfair to the rest of the good chipotles' out there,They do this not only for sour cream,I like to get sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chicken is always so fatty,Chipotle SERIOUSLY needs to trim the fat and gristle off their meat,and the steak is often inedible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let her get a taste of the magnificent burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I teetered between 3 and 4 stars and decided on 4 because I do like the taste of the food ,tortilla on burrito is not heated,guac on a burrito is $1,and $8 for a burrito (steak burrito with guac) at a fast,burrito was strangely spicy,the rice,What I don't like: Tortilla chips are not free,The steak,I think the steak at Chipotle is of better quality than the steak at Moe's (2nd best) ,sour cream is a free,All the ingredients seem very fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the price is right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was incredibly slow and they were stingy with the food,I love chipotle,this chipotle was alright,Skip the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My only complaint is that the corn salsa is freezing cold, which tastes really weird,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you walk up the counter and decide if you want a burrito,I order three Chicken soft chicken tacos every time ,tacos,You can add rice,or bowl,meat (chicken,beans,steak,lettuce,corn,just doesn't taste right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always delicious,I have been here dozens of times over the years and the only qwalm I have is the old manager Ryan is no longer there after being there for years and keeping it better than it is now but whatever still food is always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It doesn't do Chipotle any good talking about their philosophy of food ,"""If you don't want chicken go to the head of the line",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The one starting the burrito did not even know which meat was which, Both the rice ,and pinto beans were hard and the chicken was fat,They were our of chips and salsa 2 hours before closing too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food has always been good,the next time the cover for the bowl can barely be closed ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great service love the food the quality,It's the only Chipotle on the area that knows how to cook the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so little putting burritos together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Usually bowls or burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My favorite burrito at any Mexican,the meat is flavorful, The ingredients are fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the veggie bowl,one & only time I got some chicken it was poorly trimmed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was delicious,I would go out of my way to come to this chipotle only because the employees have got to be the friendliest people I have ever experience in Boston,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They always stuff your burrito full,One of my favorite chipotle locations,So delicious,Always fresh and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst experience at a chipotle ever,Barely 1 scoop of rice in the bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Go spend it at a place that cares about the food,and really high prices,prices should be rock bottom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She's bad for business and bad for chipotle,no longer terrorizing the chipotle clients,and rice,"Maybe you gave me a little too much barbacoa but now I'm eating a ""half steak"" bowl since there's practically no barbacoa left on my bowl",the next person who ordered barbacoa got contaminated meat from being on a different bowl next,beans,I had asked for half steak,She serves the steak , to the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
:( Sometimes I get a burrito with chicken or steak ,And sometimes I get all those ingredients in a bowl ,black beans,pinto beans,medium salsa,and eat it with chips,and guacamole,cheese,sour cream,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is alright,especially when there's a Moe's RIGHT DOWN the street w/ similar food,especially when I can go to almost ANY other Mexican food place in Atlanta ,I ordered a chicken burrito which was so huge,Chipotle charges for chips and salsa,and get free (and sometimes unlimited) chips and salsa,There's no salsa bar either,I would've loved to drown it all in as much salsa as I wanted to,Without enough salsa however,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks Chipotle for helping to broaden my palette in the early 2000's when the authentic Mexican food scene in CBUS was far less accessible,last time the burrito bowl was a little,get a bowl and ask for burrito wraps or taco,If you've never had a grapefruit Izzy its delicious,Margarita+Large cup+Grapefruit soda=Paloma(kinda) also delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and we were really happy with the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is very greasy,The food itself has a good,Not awful food,so I ended up throwing away 2/3 of my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd rather stick with chinese food atleast it will get me full,This is how much meat you get ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is food poisoning waiting to happen,I got the burrito bowl as take out,when i get to my job to eat it the rice was so under cooked it crackled ,The chicken was also taste less ,My job is a 5 minute drive away and with the 90 degree blazing heat outside i didn't understand how the chicken was cold,so i couldn't comprehend how the meat got as cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle's burrito choices have little,at over $6 a burrito,I'd test market a half burrito at,relatively healthy (brown rice is now offered),65% of the price - boost business with more traffic through great,You can put in the ingredients of your choice,bypassing all the neophyte patrons who always seem to have trouble deciding on the exact ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The Chipotle flavors were all there so the food tasted good,"Now the bad: I got the ""steak"" burrito bowl ",I really enjoy the lime flavored chips, Most folks can tell when chips are stale,and while I know it's not high grade steak, Chips should be crunchy and delicious not chewy, It tasted ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food doesn't hurt either,Ok this is my go to chipotle as it's the closest to where I live,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I incredibly appreciate the quality of the food, The portions are plentiful and eating there means a great fresh meal whose taste is really fantastic at an  affordable price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more than overshadowing the very minor bottleneck that developed in food prep,the size of their burritos would get them another 0,Hella-pricey, A guy I was with ate a piece of fallen chicken off the table ,ICE-COLD cheese and salsa or something that sent me looking for a microwave:  -0,398 stars for the tasty spicy meats ,guacamole:  damnit,the varied and tasteful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was cold ,The server need training in how to wrap a burrito,she broke the first burrito ,I have to say this was the smallest 6 burritos ever made,and some of the corn tasted frozen,This location has really gone down in quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are out of rice or chicken and end up waiting for food to be prepped/cooked,and then end up running out rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They forget to clean the food they have dropped off the line as they go,The floor is food dropping friendly,The workers are preparing bowls and burritos TOO fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love chipotle,The gentlemen fixing her bowl was agitated ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty much threw out the the chicken streak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They're very speedy and the food is always fresh,it's simply for the amount of food they provide ,Yesterday I rushed in during lunch times to grab a chicken burrito,I'm always at odds with Chipotle because if I don't control myself I can down a whole burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The last time I was there my burrito was cold to the touch ,they have run out of some key ingredient such as cheese or rice,and the meat seemed like it had been refrigerated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is solid,I love the fresh ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,I've always been safe with chicken, and delicious,but damn it was soft and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
neither was the rice ,and my chicken was so fatty,Alright this is my third time coming here in the past month andat this point I'm just disappointed all three times my lettuce was not fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My wife gets the veggie burrito ,I always get the tacos,My kids get the black bean and cheese tacos with sour,They also say they don't like the tacos,but it is damn good meat,With just meat,They think the guacamole is a bit spicy,cheese,sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I could bite my burrito in one bite,easy 1/3 of a Chipotle burrito,rice,corn cheese ,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there were signs posted that they were out of chips,they were out of guacamole with signs posted about it,The lady ahead of me had to ask literally 4 times for extra sides of sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chicken has been served to me undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,the building across from the Uncle Sam billboard other corner of Newport & Beale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I been at this location a couple time and 2 times I've gotten uncooked rice kinda disappointing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
making food,Really disappointed to pay $13 for a burrito that tasted like beans,bland chicken,Tasted like I was eating dry beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think everyone has touched on the parking so I will move on to the food,The burritos are fat so if you split it in half ,Pretty standard Chipotle which means it's delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is amazing,I was walking out with the beautiful bowl they made me ,They immediately came and cleaned it up for me and re took my order and made me a new bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best burrito bowl to date,well seasoned chicken and rice,Fresh chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but make sure you load up that burrito good,I like to see how large I can make my burrito,Good prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had four orders 2 salads and 2 burrito bowls they were so bland,Let's start with they ran out of guacamole ,The salads didn't have enough lettuce ,and they salad dressing was very bland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The seasoning of the food at this location is different,than the other restaurants I've been to and the food at the location is very bland,The servers are slower than molasses and they seem as if they do not know how to cook because they appear to be afraid of dishing out the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I LOVE chipotles food ,To top it off the food was sub,Again the food was bad,We didn't visit chipotle for a while ,my barbacoa tasted like soap and they have lessen the already pitiful amount of chips they give you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you run out of rice,I've been to this Chipotle four times and each time they've been out of rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The meat portion is small,80 for the half spoon of guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I used to be a white-rice-chicken-black-beans-with-medium-salsa-lettuce-and-cheese burrito bowl girl,with their recent addition of brown rice ,I decided to uber-healthify my bowls and get brown rice,chicken,black beans ,If I'm living on the wild side I'll get a bag of chips ,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I found out that I can get plain rice that isn't mixed,I love the barbacoa but I wish the chicken was a pulled,chicken,the chicken they use now is too dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only choices you have are burrito (wrap or bowl),Unlike burritos from a fast,Only reason I got two burritos was because I went in with a mindset of getting a burrito ,Got two burritos with different,If you're in a mood for a burrito,taco (soft,I can tell the tastes of the meat without looking,or salad,you can taste each individual ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These morons can't even wrap a burrito properly,Every single time I come here my burrito falls apart almost immediately,This chipotle is garbage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are quite large,The only problem is slight inconsistency depending on who's preparing your burrito,you might get a lot of rice one time,and the ingredients are of superior, quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food is always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I probably get tacos 2/3 of the time and a burrito the rest of the time,When you are looking for quick tacos or burritos, The service is always quick and friendly and the prices are very reasonable,chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20 after tax burrito (for carnitas) is almost the price of a sit-in,The only complaint I have is the price,It's a pretty hearty sized buritto made with fresh ingredients,The freshness of their ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All the tables in the restaurant had left over food on them ,Worst chipotle we have ever been to,We will never be returning back to this chipotle,My fiance asked for a chicken quesoritto which he usually gets,They didn't know how to make it so they started making a quesadilla we told them that was not correct so they scooped everything off of it and just made a cheese quesadilla,We told them again that is not what he wanted so they just threw a tortilla on top of the cheese quesadilla ,His meal did not taste like it normally does ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and use the freshest food possible,They are also said to be one of the most transparent companies in the food industry,* My wife was not the most impressed with her veggie burrito,* The cilantro lime rice,* The corn salsa,* Food quality,and I prefer one that tastes more fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle and the food is always great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I ordered a three piece tacos , They took the three piece tacos ,and mixed it together and I couldn't even use my hands to pick up the tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Get the veggie burrito with black,beans ,and delicious meal is very hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the rice was crunchy,I told him the rice was crunchy ,I went in and ordered 2 steak bowls on my lunch break ,Well when I got to my office I opened up my steak bowl,My co-worker also ordered 2 bowls ,He then tells me he will only credit me with one bowl ,I said why would you not credit me for the two bowls I purchased,the steak was very fatty,I told him  and the steak was chewy,I am very unhappy and this has left a very bad taste in my mouth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also the customer service is great the food is fresh,I love eating at chipotle ,and this is honestly the cleanest chipotle I have ever been to, and so is the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was cold ,and most of the chicken was uncooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is definitely above,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both times I went they were out of food, The most recent visit there was food shortage notice on the door,not a deal breaker for me then I proceed with my order and theres no chicken ready,So I get out of line and wait for the chicken,So after about 10 mins the chicken is ready,I had a coupon for free chips ,She goes to get the chips ,and they're all out of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was just about to drive out and go to another chipotle that was a bit further,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the chicken burrito bowl ,and chicken tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their bowls and burritos are yum,and I like that they try to only get natural and local ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They even gave my friend a free burrito once because she goes so often,This Chipotle location consistently has quality service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think it is reasonably priced for the amount of food you get,I am a big fan of this burrito chain ,and Quincy was missing a burrito place,They do a nice job of really stuffing the burrito full,I think Chipotle is right in line with other burrito places,In terms of price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love love chipotle food,all these burrito bowl has over 1500 calories ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good food,You know what I love about chipotle,Any chipotle I go to,the ingredients are fresh, and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are several more options for Mexican food in the city,it's a good spot if you want a filling portion of food for a cheaper price than most restaurants,The burritos are huge,60 more for guacamole which I think is too steep a price,It's also not clear what is included with the price as ingredients are lined side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Did they just raise the prices here again,Why not sacrifice the couple extra cents you're making by keeping the prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Every time I have gone I have been very happy with my food ,high quality ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the bf got the salad b/c I did and he enjoyed hiswith beans and rice,I had to get it without the rice,please please skip the sour cream,if you get a salad here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm so glad this location opened near me and don't have to travel far for chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The portions are toddler like scoops of rice ,and meat to mounds cheese and rice,The meat is under cooked ,There were at least five employees behind the counter and yet they were still getting backed up and missing ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was very upset while eating my chipotle today,I wish this wasn't the closest chipotle to my new,I was okay not getting any meat but as I was eating my bowl I had a huge chunk of uncooked rice in my bowl ,I wanted steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
worth of chicken on my burrito,Ask for/pay for extra protein if you would like to have almost the normal amount you usually get at chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've eaten at this location a few times and love the fresh ingredients in the burritos ,The burritos there are really big,The last time I was there about   two months ago I had a burrito bowl ,The restaurant sits on  a corner on a small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle's food isn't any better or different,"Andrea is the sweetest ""burrito artist"" - she knows my boyfriend ",than any other chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My opinion on a fast-food burrito chain where people expect to be in ,Something I rely on Chipotle for is being able to be in and out when I need good food in a hurry,If a branch of a fast-food chain isn't fast , A+ for the food ,5 minutes to get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you want an unappetizing soggy burrito that falls apart in your h,Staff member who made mine today couldnt roll it and so a second staff member had to step in and transfer the now mushed up mass of ingredients to a second,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The same quality of flavors ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also the food doesn't seem as fresh,I do love the restaurant itself and the food is good,quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the line moves fast & the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super fresh ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fresher food,But you've got to give credit to the lightening-fast burrito slingers who make the long,knowing what you want on your burrito before you say the words, Keep in mind that chicken is consistently just-a-little-bit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A little hack is getting a burrito bowl ,and chips-then use the chips to scoop out the ingredients,I recommend trying all of the different meats ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know the burrito rave is done ,I love their fresh ingredients and their corn salsa is yummy,I choose Chipotle out of convenience because it's around the corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My 8 year old came down with food poisoning after eating at this location,He had a steak burrito with white,he only ate a small portion of the burrito, rice,black beans,and cheese,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Placing food order for 9 girls ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service was good though (skip steak as a filling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's just like any other chipotle (delicious, The service is noticeably above average for a chipotle , The only complaint I do have is that the portions seem to be a lot smaller than that of most other chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By the time she was done making my delicious veggie tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
considering all the burritos I'm now eating),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have not been to chipotle in over a year so I came to this one to get a queserito,Please fire this worker she ruined my chipotle experience that I haven't had in so long,She gave me 1/8 of a teaspoon of guacamole and my chips tasted like salt on cardboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is usually edible,and then have your food go cold,I watched in horror another time as my bowl was absolutely flooded with sour,"""A little bit of the pinto beans"" can mean anything from three beans to three pounds of beans",I watched in amusement as one employee took time to artfully arrange a few slivers of cheese,there's no consistency with ingredient servings: skimp on everything one time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we got a burrito ,and a burrito bowl, I got home and my burrito was so poorly wrapped everything dropped out ,Worst chipotle experience I've ever had,I tried to turn it into a just a salad,but the veggies were so burnt the entire meal tasted awful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maintaining their standards and quality throughout all location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They were out of chicken ,they run out of meats too often,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 There's no point in writing about the quality of the food,which are typically easier parking situations and IMO better quality food,and I happen to love burritos, How Chipotle seems to have the favor of burrito lovers is a mystery to me,decent quality Tex-Mex,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Then they proceeded to tell me that I had to pick a day and time that wouldnt inconvenience the staff and also I had no choice what was in the burrito ,so Chipotle called me this week and told me that I won the drawing from the buisness card fishbowl, What about my coworkers who dont like beans or are lactose,but the meat, I think Freebirds is right around the corner too, Bad taste in my mouth right now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been to this one 3 times and each time thought the poor food quality was due,All the other food is average,The chips are always stale,The Chipotle chain has always impressed me with its quality ,The ice tea taste like slightly dirty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To begin the portion that they serve you is small for a bowl,I always get steak bowls ,and the quality of this meat was poor,In about 80% of the bites i took of meat there was gristle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No one wants to wait 15 minutes for food that should take less than 5 minutes,they pile on the fajita on my burrito ,Do people actually enjoy the burnt taste in their burrito,I usually get that and then use the guac to smear on my burrito or taco,The tacos are great,I absolutely love chipotle,chipotle usually has really good,4 stars for chipotle ,My white rice was also on the mushy,I'm also a huge fan of their chips ,I've also noticed that this location has ran out of certain meats,start cooking up the meat asap,If you don't pile on massive amounts of cheese ,and sour cream,fresh ingredients,The first time my husband brought it home and I had to pick out all the charred pieces and I could still taste the burntness in certain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
.chips were stale,40 days since I moved from Southern California and finally got a taste from home,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
com/post/23669592255/seeing-the-line-at-chipotle-on-ponce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was okay,I just dont understand why only 2 people are making burritos ,and bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not new to the chipotle scene,The bag of chips I bought were completely stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its filling food ,the second I unwrapped my burrito from the foil it fell apart, This Chipotle location has never managed to wrap a burrito well, Enjoy your burrito bowls ,and poorly wrappted burritos with a spoon people,1) The brown rice was not cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is similar to other locations where food is always consistent,My dining experience at this location wasn't very pleasant as the tables were very dirty and seats had food all over it,food ,I really like chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 If you touch something other than food,they are there to keep the customer's food clean,I went in to get a burrito around 7 PM on Sunday, So the girl who was operating the grill warmer heated up my burrito,as soon as she was done cleaning she apparently got tired of waiting for the other two girls to come back so she started making my burrito, Then moves my burrito down the line, Then she proceeds to roll my burrito,When she gets to the cheese she scoops the cheese with the same,old sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best American style Mexican food ever h,I also love their commitment to serve only organic local fresh food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and enjoyed their burritos especially in Denver,but I miss those perfect burritos from Denver,Last week they ran out of bowls,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is bl,and it's not worth the price they charge for the amount (scarce) of food they give,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are pricey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited 40 min for a taco ,my son steak tacos were underdone,very stingy with the meat guacomole had no flavor looked in the kitchen ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff is friendly and usually do a pretty decent job with my burrito that I basically get every ingredient in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Although the food was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50 just to melt the cheese on the burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the hassle is still worth it for the quality of food,Not too consistent with scoops of rice,beans,salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is a great chain and serves awesome food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just wanted a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The burritos are HUGE,the burrito bowls are delish,and I love the tacos with a dash of the Tabasco Chipotle sauce too, My fave concoction for a quesadilla is the spicy beef with cheese and black beans, You can't beat the guac and chips,but choose your ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
put it on the whole damn burrito,the burritos were built much better, I told them I wanted guacamole, They plopped guacamole on one end ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the food part,The chicken I had in my burrito bowl was deliciously seasoned,and even the salsa are all extra,The chips,And those chips,guacamole,and the guacamole was so fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always a fan of Chipolte and more a  fan of the burrito,Went with the chicken burrito because I'm a fan of both chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burrito,salad or burrito bowl - veggie,order meal (taco,Standard Chiptole menu/prices,salad or  bowl - veggie,steak or chicken),pick your toppings (choice of pinto or black beans,several salsas,guacamole ,cheese,and sour cream) then pay,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its the subway for quasi mexican food,I go once or twice a month and get tacos or salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's Cinco de Mayo and I'm driving home from work and thinking where could I buy a burrito ,The burritos are huge,Paid $16 for two humongous chicken burritos,Not sure why anyone would complain about their prices,guac and chips,and delicious and made with fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've had great service and good food everytime I've been here,Part of their star rating is their commitment to good wholesome food,Their food doesn't explicitly say it anymore,My favorite dish is a Salad Bowl (they cook the rice in a skillet with ,I feel safe and wholesome after eating my salad bowl,but ALL the meats are raised without antibiotics ,That means that even the Barbacoa isn't complete feed lot meat,You know the one that's sooo good with all the sour cream and cheese,Even though they serve coke products they've got plenty of lemon for your water and natural beverages if you want to avoid corn syrup ,Green Salsa(lots of it in place of salad dressing),and I always pass on the salad dressing,There's no other fast food chain I can think of that's serving this level of quality ingredient ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
satisfying meal from a company that actually cares about where their ingredients are sourced from,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I like Chipotle's food ,and feel badly for them that our food supply has been contaminated ,and it has affected what people think of their business as they are a victim of the food contamination problem out there (see pretty much,daily food recalls due,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We stopped by for lunch on Saturday and we were so disappointed by the food ,My husband ordered a burrito ,When we got up to order I asked for tacos,Only a couple of small pieces per taco shell,the meat was cold,Then it went to a girl that was adding cheese & sour,Only a drizzle of sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is average,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best thing about Chipotle is their chips,with our chips,when I order guacamole,**Every one of us in the office got guacamole on the side,or for our salads,Salad was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd like to give this location at least 3 perhaps 4 stars because Chipotle always has good food,I ordered a burrito which was hastily slapped together by the giggly young,woman behind the counter who cared more about whatever dumb teenage garbage that was going on than taking 30 seconds to be sure my burrito kept its shape,but every time I come here there out of chicken or low, on salsa or some other,All I wanted was some damn chips,Seriously though how the hell can you run out of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I travel here just about every two days just to get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually have pretty great food from Chipotle on OBT,makes me think the food was just prepped without any sanitation ughhhh,I ordered a chix salad with guacamole and I had to spit out five different things into a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why do you halt progress on my burrito to restock everything,Why is my burrito so small,And why does my small burrito cost cost so much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stay loyal to good food ,and choose your burritos,tacos,The ingredients are of such, a higher quality at Chipotle it's not even funny,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20 PM and after starting my order for rice bowl realized the grilled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered Two burrito bowls from this store online ,but there was a significant lack of both quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you need your Mexican food fix,the service is quick and clean- and the food is good,I love their burrito bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other than the lame portioning the food is what you'd expect it to be,Whether it be a bowl or a burrito,I've been here many times and yet I have to ask for more rice every single,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Get it together guys: your food is great,At 11:40 it took me 15 minutes to get my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When we took our food outside,I currently run a large food operation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was lukewarm ,I ordered a barbacoa burrito bowl,The rice portion was normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the chicken does not always seem to be cooked enough,even the double meat now is the same,as normal meat size a year ago,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food wasn't awful,I tried the burrito bowl,I asked if they had cheese salsa to go with their chips instead of their guac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PLUS their fanfuckingtastic cilantro lime rice (I've picked up a Burrito Bowl size of just THAT rice to go with dinner-yum),Burrito bowl fan,and I get pretty much every vegetable they offer in that bowl,bowl weighs about 2 or so pounds,half grilled chicken,pinto beans (cooked with baaacon),tomato salsa,roasted chili-corn salsa,bag of chips,Side of guacamole,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make the drive to another location unless you want to spend $10 on $3 worth of food,I've been to chipotles all over the US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ask for a chorizo bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is our 3rd time ordering food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is already cooked ,I keep coming back because my bowl of brown rice,chicken,salsa,a little cheese,and lettuce isn't all that bad,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Try a burrito bowl with a tortilla in it for that little,Great salty chips too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wouldn't return to this particular Chipotle if it was the last food establishment left after a nuclear,The food itself was bottom-run,even) line-starting tortilla guy who couldn't focus on your order because he was off in la-la unicorn kingdom (I was jealous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really liked their food,which she heated up on the burrito warmer,I was ordering two burritos after,two burritos, She lays down both burritos wraps together in the warmer,I ask for a salad bowl,I asked for a chicken ,and cheese quesadilla,for my salad,after I ordered a salad,I don't mind the taste of tin foil that much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a simple customized burrito for the road,except a little more pricey ,and of course it's located right on the corner so you have to quickly park across the street,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was the first visit to a chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When the Nat Dogg wants a burrito, They are the leaders in the burrito industry, I only came here after a wild night at Ups and Downs and I needed my burrito fix right away,and stale ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Service was great and the food was always the way you wanted ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Good food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If I had to choose one of the many burrito chain joints over the others,It's white rice with seasoning you can taste ,4) Variety of salsas,The corn salsa is sweet,Spicy beef that's a nice option in comparison to the regular overly grilled micro hunks of steak you get at other,1) Free sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh & the burrito is amazing,The two females and one male on the line today (3pm 7/13/2017) at chipotle were the friendliest people ever,Chipotle customer service and overall quality has usually been a hit or miss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Decent food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can let it go once but it shows to go how much attention is being made while preparing customers food,So I was casually eating my burrito ,Alright it's fine sometimes we make mistakes and continue to eat my burrito with a little more caution just in case,That will be the last time I buy a burrito from this chipotle,and while I'm eating it I taste something hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the most average chipotle visits I've ever had,I'll take my local chipotle back home thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't like Mexican food,but chipotle tastes worst than normal Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  Great customer service and was even rewarded with free guacamole since we were first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They have a small amount of seating inside like most other chipotles, Food is tasty like other chipotles too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I found out that you aren't charged any extra if you want extra rice ,and beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The price is good for the large amount of food ,Husby LOVES burritos, The burritos are rather decent, and the tacos are okay, I like that I can customize what I want and they have brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The amount of food they give me here lasts for lunch ,I order the burrito bowl,Quick tip: If you get a $30 dollar Chipotle giftcard you get a free burrito,you can get a free burrito for every 4-5,burritos :,chipotle is pretty much,If you order two types of meat you end up with a lot more stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the food here,The reason for my low review isn't because any one was rude or the food was bad,I'm also a burrito purist,"Never will I voluntarily eat a ""burrito"" bowl",It's because no one in this establishment knows how to wrap a goddamn burrito,I come here with optimism: maybe they won't burst my burrito today,My burrito is always wrapped poorly,Now I've been reduced to having to open up my burrito ,Please train your employees to wrap burritos,I love chipotle,and load its insides into a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always hot,but when it comes to this kind of food you mainly just want them to get the food together so you can begin shoveling it down your throat,They have multiple salsas to try on your food,I recommend getting a mix (maybe hot and corn or mild and corn) of salsas to really add something to the food,I prefer getting my food to go ,and a good quality meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a longer drive home and they wrapped my burritos up so they'd stay warm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ask for plain rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-4 for food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their website boasts that you can customize your burrito - want more salsa,Chipotle promises the perfect burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe because it is fairly new and maybe the turnover of food is not fast,some rice in my bowl is hard,Otherwise the other ingredients are fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or just any old reason bc the food is great,My customizable burrito bowl ,and extra guacamole on the side to dunk tortilla chips flavored with a hint of lime,The portions are enormous so for $10 after the extra guac and chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reference for online food order: May 4,Ordered a chicken burrito for pickup,Then was given a bowl instead of a burrito,I let them know about the mistake and was asked if I cared if it was just poured into a burrito shell,At the end of the line I saw the burrito steamer give me an almost disgusted,"When given my ""new"" burrito",Will not order online and will definitely not return to this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The app always gives 30 to 45 minute wait time to get your food,The chipotle app is horrible,I keep bringing it to workers and managers attention at chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's not many food options in Quincy,They give a lot of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are the turd in the Chipotle punch bowl,The chicken ,They are not only cooking their meat wrong,and steak are consistently grizzled ,but something is wrong with the quality at this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ive been stuck in the massive lines to get my food from this busy,They serve burritos,Sometimes when a lot of people want burritos,it takes longer to get my burrito,Here is how I get my burritos within 30 seconds of walking through the door,I log into my chipotle app (for iphone,I always order double meat with extra corn salsa ,but i've noticed the ingredients are always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 If you need to get food uber-fast,but cops eat 1//2 price there or maybe it was free,but the steak here was BEYOND chewy, Just maybe go with a choice other than the steak, The ones in Orlando look the same and almost taste the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll see what the food is like ,I asked for a chicken burrito with black, beans on a wheat tortilla,Then she said 'what kind of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great quality and amount of food for the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also bought the $30 giftcard for a free burrito of my choice on my next,I asked for it to be split into 2 bowls,They put a good amount into both bowls,They told me they usually don't split and will  give an extra bowl instead,She was very nice and bought my 2nd bowl for me as an exception,Ordered a Bowl with chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ate at chipotle over a 100 times,The steak was very chewy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Not sure if that mattered or not but the food was always really good," When my order got started I had to repeat ""bowl"" about 3-5", When my bowl finally started getting made, I also found the butt of an onion in my bowl,the ingredients were so skimpy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then he asked for a Chicken burrito ,Prices is the same,but SMALL portions and same price,MUCH LESS meat than other,When she tossed the steak on the tortilla it was VERY noticeable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after yesterday's visit my husband and I will no longer be returning we hadn't eaten anything since this and We both developed food poisoning the next,I am truly sad because for a minute I though I would turn into a chipotle as much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They suck at wrapping burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I guess that just shows how popular and great the food is at Chipotle,I usually get the hard tacos with steak ,I love getting lunch at Chipotle because of the quality of the ingredients they use,and let me tell you they are delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The meat was burnt,They rationed out the meat like I was Tiny Tim,My girlfriend had a cheese quesadilla,It was a cheese quesadilla without the cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can be a little pricey if you're looking to save a few, I'll usually grab the steak with guacomole' ,and shreeded cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I crave it a few times a month and nothing can satisfy me other than my burrito bowl,They really need to create a queso and their chips are always stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
being that I was pressed for time and the person I was getting food for requested Chipotle,and to my amazement they actually took great care of me and waived the cost of the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My favorite chipotle,They get a little skimpy with the rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I guess I really wanted a burrito,and just ok tastewise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love their burrito bowls, Always filling at a good price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is VERY filling,Inexpensive for the quantity of food ,I got a burrito ,Don't order the chips and the burrito,The staff there is very friendly and the prices are quite similar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They served undercooked chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The disorganization led to a long online ordering line that took 45 minutes longer than expected to get food,You are better off waiting in the long walk in and order there because people who came in the same time got their food 25 minutes before I did,The only reason that I got my food is that you had to come to the front of the line ,but giving food to the people who bugged them the most,I know this system works in other stores as my food is always ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Like other locations you walk up to the counter tell the first person if you want a burrito,taco,Then you continue down the assembly line adding rice,bowl or salad,beans ,Then you add your salsas,and type of meat,cheese,sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are so ridiculously stingy with the food it's sad,I always feel like I've paid $8 for a half of a burrito bowl,They charge for guacamole ,You ask for cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a burrito with chicken,It left me with such a bad taste in my mouth that I had to stop ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the friendly staff and amazing food,They are doing something right over there because this is one of my favorite chipotle's to go to,he recommended the Barbacoa bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle's food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,because it's chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the sofritas bowl is amazing,and the thing fell into the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I arrived at the time it said it would be ready on the order and I still had to wait for the food,Just a basic and very bland burrito bowl,no fresh tomato salsa,and no side of guacamole like I paid extra,No sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Twice in less than a week they have forgotten part of my food for my online, And all you do is blame your system and offer my a free burrito card,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chicken is dry as well as the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is sooo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vegetarian and vegan warning:  There was chicken in the  advertised,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am a fan of chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito was cold by the time it reached  Matt's coworker on the food assemble,If he would just helped out opposed to watching and having attitude everyone's food would have gone out on ti,In his mind just standing in the corner heating the burrito shell was suffice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chipotle is hands-down the best ""fast-food"" there is",she does like the flavors but is new to Mexican food so she's only went for the tacos so far,and I've had everything on the menu except the veggie burrito, I'm partial to the carnitas burrito with rice,hasn't attempted a burrito,recently she's getting hooked on my homemade burritos,black beans,medium salsa,extra cheese & sour,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Queso burrito makes a fine,"Definitely my winner in the ""toss meat beans rice ",Nicely seasoned spicy chicken,and salsa into a steamed,Mostly because of the corn salsa ,and the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The thing I hate about chipotle is sometimes the food taste old, and not fresh and for that reason I only like to eat chipotle once in a blue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As far as the food goes,The chips are awesome,the meat was a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the food at Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location provides the same great Chipotle taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The I Phone App is great so that you can order prior to arriving and then go to the register and pick up your food,the food is not without quite a few,I love tacos ,and chips and salsa,The choices of salsas are great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only getting 2 stars bc I still love the food,Just got back from ordering a burrito bowl at thi,After all the crap chipotle is going through,and everyone who knows chipotle knows that guac i,I eat at chipotle A LOT ,so I go back and just asked for chicken since I paid the price for it anyway,They told me I was wrong and that its always the same price ,I ordered a veggie bowl,s included in a veggie bowl,i notice they charged me for a chicken bowl with the extra,"I figured ""hey I already paid for it"" and I only decided on veggie bowl to save the $2 anyway",and I know that guac is free in veggie bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was a huge amount of food,My hubby got his usual Carnitas Burrito & I got a veggie burrito,Ordered chips n,It's been a while since we've visited -I've since sworn off meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is still just as good,I LOVE chipotle ,Often times I plan on taking a 15 minute run to get chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They said they charge you 90 cents if you get 2 or more scoops of rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sucks because the food is as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My family and I have been going to locations further out to avoid having to deal with these rude Managers but were reluctantly forced to come back because the everywhere else was way too inconsistent with the food,Miami and Orlando and your restaurants are always consistent with great food ,The Managers are super nice it seems that only in Georgia I have noticed that once in a while is the normal when it comes to the food, The food is never the same,I look forward to going out of town because I know that I am getting a better quality of food,not enough seasoning on the protein rice being too hard,I ordered my usual chicken bowl ,he did not want to hear what I had to say instead he put my bowl to the side ,she gave me a half of a spoon of chicken I asked her to make it a double,Your reception area was filled with patrons and I find that it was in utterly poor taste that one of your frontline representatives sought out to speak in such, We are well known at this store and it is quite perturbing that your frontline employee handled one of your normal customers in such a distasteful,I know how good Chipotle tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love their antibiotic-free meat ,and the dressing for their salad is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's no question that chipotle has good food,so there's no need for me to talk about HOW good their food is,the food is always good,so they didn't use two tortillas per soft taco,i've tried to get myself sick of chipotle by eating it everyday,but the ones available at chipotle (a secret,i simply wanted to say they now have corn tortillas,i doooo love corn tortillas,the thicker corn tortilla makes the mouth,but their corn tortillas aren't as great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a burrito bowl ,The burrito bowl was ok,and was given the end of the brown rice as I watched the server bring over a br,and new spanking container of rice, The tortilla chips were just right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle only has 5 choices for burritoes,This place charges WAY too much for burritos, All of the meat burritoes are over 6 dollars, Unlike other popular burrito places like Anna's or Felipe's,where a large burrito with meat will run you under five dollars,to add guac to your burrito cost $1, The servers are breaking every other burrito they're making, Everything is way over priced,one chicken,the cashier let someone cut in front of us to get chips and salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burrito bowl aaall the way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love going to this chipotle because the people are nice,Some of the chipotles I've visited in the past have served over cooked,Over all though my experience is always good when I come to this chipotle, chicken or under cooked beef,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is very affordable,I recommend the salads and the burrito bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do not much care for chipotle because I don't feel that it had a lot of flavor compared to a free,The thing this time that bothered me was that the black beans were still hard,This just effected the total quality of the meal for m,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is always fresh,The steak bowl is always by go-to, with a side of chips ,The only thing that needs improvement is the steak is a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't review chains usually but my fiancé and I have consistently been so happy with the service and food at this particular,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Former Creative Loafing food reviewer Bill Addison gave Chipotle a favorable,Their soft black bean tacos with salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I got my food,I just had the burrito bol,no rice,I wouldn't call it delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pregnant women would literally go into labor before getting their burritos,Still the slowest chipotle I think I've ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bad chipotle,waiting for 5 minutes on a cheese quasadilla,the lettuce was super,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they said they ""ran out of chips for the night"" at 8:30 pm",How can you go without chips for the last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have ordered burritos ,and salads from this location and they are stingy with the portion size especially for the price,I was served stale chips ,and no dressing with my salad on multiple,Other locations have shown better quality service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was tempted to put this place to the test against my favorite burrito joint,and I had the choice of customizing my chicken burrito several,burrito,My burrito was extremely satisfying,Final verdict: Chipotle is a good option for a quick burrito fix,I thought it was slightly overpriced (compared to my regular burrito haunt,rice,I opted for rice,I thought it was slightly overpriced (compared to my regular,beans,no beans, different ways: salsa,mild pico de gallo salsa ,guacamole,and guacamole (at an extra,cheese,sour cream,lettuce,The ingredients looked fresh,but the ingredients seemed to be slightly better quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I HATED the food I had to forcibly eat it because I was starving,brown rice,Well I ordered the salad with chicken,and salsa,At the check out I ordered chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is quite good,I used to get the chicken burrito or burrito bowl,My dad got tacos and my mom got a burrito bowl,No more rice for me at Chipotle,But I got sick once due to undercooked chicken,But guac and chips are really high,You can always ask for more of everything expect the meat ,*boo* So I switched to steak,Now I get the salad as I am cutting back on calories,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
) I would have believed that they put addictive chemicals in their lime-cilantro rice if I didn't already know that their food is all organic,and sometimes I worry that they rush cooking the food to get it out quicker,Chipotle is my favorite burrito place,My typical burrito is about 28g of fat (11g saturated) or 19g (6g) ,but the cooks occasionally fall behind the servers causing customers to wait for a fresh round of rice/fajita,when holding the cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fresh food,The hot sauces are really delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pretty good burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
almost every ingredient was swapped for another (asked for brown rice,got white rice,chicken,pinto beans,black beans ,and steak),I ordered a salad and I barely got any lettuce,skimping on ingredients,Had to correct after each ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burritos are always good,"but the grilled chicken tacos (3) are my ""current",grilled chicken ,and a beef fajita meat,two corn,good taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the workers are moving so fast trying to catch up that they often mess up and do not provide a quality customer experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a burrito,I ordered a bag of chips ,It seemed that the server counted the pieces of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They even offered to grill my burrito which was a nice,I would have liked to give Chipotle a better score because the service was great and I usually love chipotle, The problem I had was that my chicken had an unusual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My favorite I almost hate saying fast-food chain, I also feel they barely give you any meat if you get a burrito bowl,50 for a burrito bowl (Guacamole included) ,and there's barely any meat in there,where you get more parking and a tiny bit more meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Nobody likes to see the dried-out bottom of the pan steak or chicken going into their burrito,there was some mix-up and they wound up giving me my burrito free, And the burritos have been consistenly hot,I've caught them dumping old meats that have been sitting ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they gave me barely enough food for 6 bites for $9,I got chicken and beef juice all over my lap and car because the bag they gave me was ripped and they didn't think to double bag for a 2lbs double-everything burrito,I usually love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After he slopped my burrito through the li,and i have had this same burrito wrapped many,Chunks of my burrito oozed out ,and he just smeered the burrito in it then layed it down to wrap it,When I went to eat the burrito from the wrapper it was a mess,half of the burrito ended up on the table,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was the first time in history of Anyas love and addiction to chipotle that I could not finish my bowl,I love chipotle,I worship chipotle,I have a chipotle hoodie bought on ebay,The only good thing about this chipotle is the clean,Im forced to make a trip to Cleveland Cicrle chipotle,Avoid this chipotle,The rice was overcooked,I could NOT finish my bowl,the salsas were blah, The guacamole was brownish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tastes good,We both ordered similar tacos tonight ,I could squeeze my tacos shut they were so empty,Please fill at comparable amounts when sending two taco dinners away in one order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Adding guacamole to the burrito is nearly $2 (30% uplift on burrito, price) ,  Food is fine quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all I'm doing is enjoying the crap out of this burrito while typing a Yelp review,There's a security guard standing in the corner staring at me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The person taking my order and making my burrito was quiet, The rolling of my burrito was poor, Had salsa get on my car seat on the ride home due to over stuffing of the burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No matter how long the line they get you through in a jiffy and the food is worth the wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is the blandest food I've ever had,Even for free food,I first tried it about 6-7 years ago when I had a free burrito coupon,I will continue to eat my burritos at Willy's,Still tasted like nothing wrapped up in a tortilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have a bunch of food allergies that happen to be well-served,by the food at Chipotle,Maybe twice I've seen the lettuce be a little,The ingredients are always well-prepared,they run out of one ingredient or another,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is REAL food,I recommend the Barbacoa bowl with plain brown rice,Extra meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food didn't even taste the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got there at 12:13 and got my burrito at 12:45,Everyone else waiting for online pick ups got their burrito on average,However the way I got the burrito back from the gentlemen who I assume was the manager was just terrible,1 star because he also messed up the burrito,you know how bland a burrito is with no sauce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quality burritos,I had a problem with my burrito,I go to this chipotle about 5 times a week (excessive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,This is the first time I have ever seen a bouncer like security guard at a chipotle,Some chipotles are great,I did get les than a scoop of chicken in my bowl, and the chicken was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you cannot get a burrito,they started making my carnitas burrito,and guac on my burrito,but I already know I like other fast burritos,I'm all set with you chipotle,I got hot salsa,The spicy salsa wasn't even spicy,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was prepared right at the pickup time,The food tasted fresh,really good food ,The chicken was seasoned well ,The salsas were spicy , and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Standard food,$10 will get you a giant burrito with guar ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 He managed to get my burrito wrapped like a pro, The new brown cilantro rice adds a nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They just don't give you good enough quality food ,50 or so for a godamn steak burrito which they insist on giving you more filler than meat, The burrito maker scooped some steak , Mind you there is probably no more than 3oz of meat overal in the burrito, Also a burrito from chipotle has appoximately 1,and a piece fell into the chicken pile ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was as expected,"which seemed to confuse them a bit - ""Are you sure you don't want any meat",and taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The customer service at this chipotle was so amazing,Jasmine the cashier was especially kind and I'll keep coming back to this chipotle because of her ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is my favorite location the staff is super friendly the place is always clean and the food is great,I could eat chipotle everyday,now with a family of 6 the price isn't all the bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's not even as if this is healthy food,The food is bland,They trick you into think it's hipster-friendly health food while they promote their organic,Adding guac to my burrito bowl put the price at an even $9,Sprinkling salty tomatoes and a handful of lettuce on a bowl of rice ,and beans doesn't make it good,meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the ingredients are high quality and the food is tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is Chipotle so you likely know the menu/food , I always ask for little or no rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the lady gave me a little scoop of chicken,-meat is always juicy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Been here a couple times and always a little slow but lived with it because they have good food,Good food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's great with chicken or pork,PS try adding a bit of both beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If the Chipotle burrito was a person it would remind me of a Mexican-American,Well poor ol' burrito,you burrito are no longer mexican,they then stuffed you with white rice,they decided to put you in a bowl,and put black beans in you,well sometimes they put pinto beans in you ,then they said no more yellow cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is never hot,I love chipotle ,not the most sanitary (I've seen the same guy eating chips while making them with no gloves ,and another time wipe his nose on the back of his hand with gloves on and then start mixing chips),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My friend before me got a full bowl,Mine is barely 3/4 and I had to ask for a little extra meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A salad that I had to ask for more lettuce because he only filled a small half side of the bowl,soggy chips out of the bag ,and a bag had just a few more chips than the kids meal bag,it's a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not even close to enough rice beans or meat on my burrito,Kind of baffles me on why a huge chain like this would need to cut corners like this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the sense that the food is always awesome,the employees are friendly and will make your food any way you want it,the guacamole is to die for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The steak and chicken are cooked & seasoned to perfection (not raw like the one on 161),diced small enough that each scoop packs a decent amount (I get dbl steak+chicken),Don't have to worry about them shafting you on ingredients (meat) here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I requested no bell peppers but some fell into my food because it  found its way into the black, The person next to her decided to chime in (who wasn't fixing my food) ,Once my bowl hit the cheese station of the food conveyor belt - more h,ands were added to my meal with the cheese man using his hand to put the cheese on my food , As we sat down and my companion ate his food,"""   Chipotle's food on a whole is not amazing",open cabinets and handling various items like he was a circus-joggling act - all before he palmed a huge amount of cheese on my rice bowl , beans so how,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I'll do it if it means having more than just cold rice and beans in my burrito bowl,We arrived at 6pm on a weeknight and they were completely out of chicken ,The grill wasn't even filled with meat that was almost done,and steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can always count on Chipotle to provide me with fairly consistent food that's inexpensive,the reason I keep coming back to Chipotle is because the food is dependable,I do appreciate their commitment to the quality and sourcing of the food,"But I guess I'd feel the same way if the only words I heard from customers were some variation of: ""Steak burrito",Vegetarian bowl with brown rice,no beans,extra black and pinto beans,medium and corn salsas,lettuce and guacamole,double steak,cheese,sour cream,this is my usual order (in case anyone wants to brave the parking lot and surprise me with some delicious Chipotle):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got food poisoning from here on Friday night,I've gotten food poisoning from here twice before within this past,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just love to grab a chicken bowl for lunch from here, The only way I could love it more is if you offered all white meat boneless skinless chicken breast as another meat option, They have the best corn salsa under the sun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always fresh food ,the restroom didn't have paper towels and when I ask to put on the press my burrito,I don't think I want to go back to chipotle again after this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However working at Chipotle one would assume you'd be able to fold a burrito,They overload their burritos with ingredients ,and therefore are unable to properly fold the burrito ,defeating the whole purpose of a burrito,and then they have to give you a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Floors had meat and other food debris under every table , We actually witnessed a lady who was grilling the meats raise her shirt over her nose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wish they served more guacamole for that extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great Price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food is so rich,and big that a beer can easily put you over the threshold into the dull world of the food-coma,The base price of a burrito or taco dinner is not too stiff,The carnitas and the barbacoa are my favorite meat options and the salsas add a lot of flavor,but if you start adding extras (like guacamole) the bottom,The lettuce is always fresh-looking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At least the food is prepared,but the chicken is too chewy,and beans,salsa,Chipotle has decent chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We all know about Chipotle's food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its good for college kids like me who are cheap (altho 3 soft tacos still cost $7),I think I'm addicted to their corn and hot salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make up for it by heaping the toppings on your burrito or bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is also good,I ordered a steak burrito ,she comped me the burrito,and a chicken one as well,the steak was far from being ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would eat a whole burrito,but now my go-to order is the burrito bowl,I never get tired of their burrito bowls,the white cilantro rice with black,beans (and I ask for more rice in exchange for fewer beans),I really love the rice,and compared to Freebirds' rice,Over the years the price has gotten up a little,chicken,corn salsa,a little bit of cheese ,and sour cream,and lettuce on top,The lettuce is nice,and the ingredients, taste fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
went over the edge of half of the bowl,Literally just left there and they slopped the beans on there,""" and the employee just started dumping salsa ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Once we got to order our food we saw why,This place has a ton of business and the food is usually decent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food ,avoid cheeses and red meats, But Cabo Bobs kicks its arse due to much better ingredient choices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle ,Out of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I sat down with my steak burrito hoping that the steak pieces were going to be as good,I could have gotten a better meat add a hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 More food for the same, My tortilla tore when they were making my burrito, price lol, Gave me a good portion of chicken which was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I felt that wasn't enough and I eat at chipotle all over ,Manager Andrew very rude unsympathetic to my complaint that we only get 12 chips for kids meal,and never received such a small amount of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was pulled in and survived the bacteria on the floor and counters long enough to get a steak burrito with salsa,Your burrito was [,there was a piece of scotch tape surprise inside the burrito,rice or beans,There weren't any noticeable seasonings in the salsa,I was hungry and looking for some starchy meaty goodness,The shredded steak was tasteless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its still chipotle and the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do not think I should have to spend more time scouting for parking than it takes for them to make me a freaking burrito,I have had so many burrito rollers break my burrito ,And it's not like I'm one of those people who asks for one of everything in their burrito,both my boyfriend and I got vegetarian burritos,and I saw chicken get spilled on his,And then I saw another person sloppily mix in cheese into the guacamole,It tasted like regular,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ended up ordering a chicken burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28 for a huge burrito,I can't find a place that tastes better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I drive all the way back and the guy says they must have given the other lady my food,Not even know sorry we wasted an hour of your time by giving you the wrong food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually get veggie burritos ,this is my favorite chipotle location in south,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the guy skips past them and tries to pass my food off to the next,then the guy who tried to withhold the beans sits down and starts eating his food,I ordered a burrito,She didn't roll my burrito so much,  I unwrap my burrito ball from the foil,I got burrito juice all over both my h,and probably won't go back to chipotle at all,I ask for white rice ,Rice is rice to me,I get her to reach back over to the guy's part of the line and put some beans on with my rice,I ask for pinto beans,I ask for guacamole three times,She ignores my final request for guacamole,and gives me some lettuce,I can accept that fast food isn't going to be of the highest quality,  It tasted fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food it took us longer to find parking than it did to get our lunch at noon ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They nickel and dime you for everything from queso to guacamole,The steak was tough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yummy food as always,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The three people working on the line seemed super stressed out and since I got no veggies or meat I asked for extra black beans ,and corn salsa which I didn't get ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's so bad that once they start making your burrito,like so messy they shouldn't be able to call themselves chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then the young teen server (a black girl) asked if I wanted double the steak,So I realized that  I wasted my breath and my money as I got back to work starving with half cooked steak that was like rubber,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its a hidden treasure behind the chicken ,and steak,it is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do have to say that I wish the cilantro in the rice was separate,& know that it holds things up to get the other rice & to add the lime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I stick with a bowl with steak,and I *must* have some of the vinaigrette that you usually put on the salads on my bowl,lots of corn salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You still have a bunch of angry people serving you food ,I worked at Dunkin Donuts for YEARS and food service is not the easiest,But it wouldn't hurt you to not get annoyed when you ask me what kind of food I'll be having that evening,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place used to be my go to for food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is still good,There is another chipotle a few,miles away (on Peachtree st) and it is worth the drive to never step foot in this dirty chipotle ever again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I've had a dry spell with tasteless food at this chipotle ,there's a good chipotle there,I am a huge chipotle advocate ,I don't know if I'm just used to good quality in arizona,but bad quality is majority of what I've had at this locatio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kind of slow when making food,I've had a huge chunk of fatty disgusting pork fat in my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff is very friendly and the food is delicious,If your not in the mood for a burrito no worries,get a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually deem it pointless to review a fast-food chain because generally people know what they are getting,My entire burrito bowl tasted burnt,but this chipotle is notably worse than any other,chipotle I have been to ,I did not have high expectations getting dinner from a chipotle at 9pm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While my bowl was just sotting their half started,If something is floating in the sour cream why would you scoop that into someones meal,There are always different things floating in the ingredients from cross contamination,They are always out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh yes I want someone's spit in my food""",The food glass partition needs to be higher or a rail that makes people st,and farther away from the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While I do love your burritos ,like BOGO burritos,you never fail to make me an exceptional veggie burrito,Veggie burrito,Pro-tip: half rice is so they can fit the rest of the goodies on there without the burrito bursting,Half rice,Who needs that much rice,Black beans,A little of the tomato and corn salsas,Some of the medium salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fine,I'll just stick with the burrito bowls instead,I ordered the barbacoa crunchy tacos , Only 2 of the 3 tacos has sour cream , The third taco had those items splashed on the outside,When I picked up my first taco to eat it,the bottom of my paper-lined basket was filled with the juice from the barbacoa so the bottoms of my tacos were starting to fall apart by the time I got to the second,but the salsa,and salsa INSIDE the shell,and the meat distri,cheese , Lettuce and cheese only made it into 1 of the shells,sour cream,and lettuce was a disaster,and tasted as I have come to expect from them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food was always on par with any other, chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the burrito bowl with beef ,The rice was under cooked ,The corn had no taste,and had a gritty taste,Overall it was slopped together and did not look appealing at all and the taste was so-so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've tried other locations and as the food always satisfies regardless of locations I love the kingsdale spot much more,And pleasantly surprised that it's a mix of both pork and chicken,Always constantly delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the same great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With all the burrito options in the area,I like that you can get bowl instead of with the tortilla,the chips are good and the salsa is fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you want to wait 40 min to order your food then don't go there,Slowest chipotle I've ever been too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I have ordered online or through the app my food is NEVER ready,I ordered my food online ,and was given of time of 2:00pm that my food would be ready,I got to Chipotle at 2:00pm expecting my food to be done,"On top of that they forgot the chicken in my daughters chicken ""taco kit"" ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm a chipotle LOVER ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Rice and beans need to be seasoned more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice,beans,Throw some on top of lettuce with tomato salsa ,While most of their meat is cooked in soybean,80 for some guacamole,and cheese-- I still have to pay $1,and oh how delicious they are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Probably the temperature they have the food at-,They really need to be inspected for food safety concerns,white rice, beans and rice were not hot,I came here on Tuesday and got a simple bowl- black, beans,salsa, enough and salsa ,guacamole, enough and  and guacamole not cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they even print out the order and put it on the lid of our bowls ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food,salty burrito,that's one salty freakin' burrito,I want fistfuls of greenery in my burrito,and their giant Super California burrito still kicks the crap out of any Chipotle ever,The worst offender seems to be the cilantro-lime rice,"but we have this rice with cilantro in it"" doesn't cut it",no rice for moi,The salsas are okay,and lettuce is too freakin,I like the fact that they're committed to using natural ingredients,You're already breaking quite a few of those rules by sourcing fresh ingredients that'd be no stranger in a Whole,I just don't feel like Chipotle has enough ingredients to really warrant being an assembly-line,I can't taste the cilantro for the salt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 This location ran out of brown rice ,I went here to get a to-go Burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle tries to be green with their food sources,but I do find their food to be tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the consistency of the food across the Chipotle organization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cook too busy cleaning up instead of making sure food on line is stocked I had to wait for white,Sad to see chipotle slip like this, rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd way rather you throw out a little every once in a while instead of burned food,on time-but our chicken was almost black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just went there for the first time and they  were very helpful and the food was very good,I love the rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was charged for chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle has good food in general,The amount of food they give you is barely anything especially the meat,They also throws around food around until it spills ,I definitely want to eat food from dirty,The food is what you always expect from Chipotle,and put it back in my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ultimate comfort food, Rice bowls with barbacoa, I love the chips ,and guacamole (my introduction to the dip happened at Chipotle), Consistent good quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't put half a tablespoon on my burrito bowl ,She also only gave us a sneeze of each item or salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Prices are fair,I cannot speak of the beans because I usually only do that on Nachos,The steak is in my experience always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for a side of hot sauce I got a ton dumped on my food,Maybe if they turn the music down the people making the bowls could hear,Now she's trying to get rid of me clearly and doesn't listen to me saying lettuce please ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Obviously the food is great, Ordered a burrito the first, Second time around I had a burrito bowl ,it felt like the only thing I was eating was rice at times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cheaper than chipotle and twice as much food,This place charges you 2 dollars for a plop of guac in the middle of your burrito, The burrito was comically tiny,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"before I could say ""NO BEANS"" she poured black beans all over my bowl",She literally poured everything I DID NOT ASK FOR in my bowl super,This woman asked me if I wanted beans,She put sour cream and cheese on there before I could tell her NO I DO NOT WANT THESE TOPPINGS I NEVER ASKED FOR THEM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Me: vegetarian fajita burrito with black,Him: beef burrito with black,beans,corn and mild salsa,lots and lots of corn salsa,guacamole,and cheese,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Probably the slowest and least friendly chipotle I've been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food was so ill prepared sticky tortillas and over flowing with sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The crew was standing around on their phones while there was next to nothing on the food line to choose from,and yet again no food being cooked,This certain chipotle location is incredibly disappointing,I will be driving the extra 15 minutes to Framingham from now on if I am in the mood for chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are packed full, and the price is reasonable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the servers NEVER give enough rice and more often than not break my burrito,Worst chipotle location I have ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Austin has such great Mexican food this should not even be a consideration,it took forever to get my food,food was very mediocre,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every other chipotle can get you in ,They actually ran out of guacamole last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't have a burrito in h,This location is by far the slowest service I've ever experienced at any chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh,usually a chicken bowl or the corn tortilla chicken tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I highly suggest the steak burrito bowl,But I liked their tacos and burritos,delicious burrito,My favorite addition is their corn salsa,Big fan of their guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good food ,but skimpy on the portions compared to other chipotle's I've visited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but after getting extra meat in a bowl,I could literally fit one of their scoop of meat in my mouth with extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the chipotle bowls,I always ask for extra rice because I get a vegetarian, bowl ,I also wish chips were complimentary,25 bag of chips that was so small,I like few ingredients so if they could be more generous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this meant your food got cold,Chipotle's food is so hard,the food often turns out edible,- the dude manning the 1st station was pushing out burritos as fast as possible,- we all watched as the one person responsible for wrapping burritos seemed fundamentally incapable, waiting for the salsa & condiment stations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""can i have a burrito",Its a chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now if she could get them to give me some more chicken,I still stand by that they just hold back on that meat portion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Veggie burrito,"For a ""quick and cheap lunch"" it turned into $20 for two burritos ",The price,with corn salsa,95 for extra guacamole,delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Usually I finish my bowls,The person that made my bowl literally stacked ,She put tons of steak,and then a little lettuce,and stacked up the ingredients like a pyramid,It would be better if the ingredients were balanced better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle Meixican Grill is a restaurant that sells Mexican food,I like spicy food,I orderd a bow with rice,I chose chicken with BBQ sauce,The chips are good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is not a typical chain foodery,Not red sauce mixed with some kinda beans ,and some kinda of meat- where it is sch-lop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
His burrito was twice the size,Thanks for the 5 kernals of corn when I ask for the corn salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pay too much to be treated this way especially for being the subway of burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Surprisingly good quality ingredients for a fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My roommate and I go out of our way to come to this chipotle ,On average we come to chipotle three times a week,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but this particular location is always out of something rice,The staff is usually nice and good at what they do except the girl I saw eating chips today with her gloves on while scooping customer chips in to the bags,meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't that the point of enjoying food,I apologize Chipotle that I don't work there and fully understand your needs as a company to process a line of customers in a certain amount of time during any type of rush and I desire to take my time and ensure I am making an appropriate decision regarding the choices I have made with the food I'm ordering in which I am ultimately paying for,"but every single time I do and of course still being a ""chipotle virgin"" if you will",I stick with the chicken,and every single time the chicken is dried out ,and tough like well done overcooked steak just chicken style,tasteless portion any day,I'd still stick with my taste buds though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have never seen a Chipotle consistently give you smaller amounts of food,Go to another chipotle or find a different burrito place,Not only do you get 1/2 scoops of meat but they some how skimp out on rice ,and beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Half-way through the meal I noticed water dripping from the ceiling and splashing into my daughter's food,We dumped our food ,Your friend in the burrito biz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worst chipotle ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dope food,drop the drugs and pick up chipotle,Their bowls are addictive,but the steak is super,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,service was ok and the homeless man was able to enjoy half of my burrito as well,I enjoy Chipoltle and really enjoy their rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hmmm super slow but they wrap the burritos much better than other,allow a potential 20-30 minutes to get a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- The food: it will ALWAYS be nom,and should only be implemented for the recognition of important happenings such as witty comebacks and successful food tossing/ mouth catching,They also are known to skimp on the rice,your dreads are in your guacamole ,If you come across a Chipotle that doesn't have delicious fresh,has fairly excellent taste in life,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looking for some food in the trash ,and he get some leftover food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Other ingredients were more ""thrown"" into the bowl with disdain",Ordered carnitas and there weren't enough in the bin for the order - instead of telling me the server just scooped up some soggy dregs from the bottom for a few soaking wet pieces of meat,Asked if I could have some fresher meat ,and was told unless I ordered double meat then I had plenty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah just found a long brown hair in my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are very fair considering the quality of the food ,which I think usually only come on the burrito, It's about $6 for a burrito,or a burrito bol (no tortilla), The girl who made my tacos prepared them really well ,3 soft tacos,4 crispy tacos,and even offered me rice ,The prices here,and there are more options than at Freebirds: fajita chicken,and beans, The Chipotle meats are lean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not sure if they are putting meth in the burritos at this location cause it's always 10x more crowded than the average,I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ask us how our food was,On to the food,I either go with the bowl or burrito w/,My burrito is always the size of my head, white rice,chicken or steak,cheese,lettuce,and lettuce,(which is delicious) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what really matters at the end of the day is the food,The Carnitas were quite bland and I wish they had the smokiness of the flavors that I tend to expect from my Mexican food,I had a burrito bowl,rice,lettuce and salsa,sour cream,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How does a store run out of food,I couldn't believe they had ran out of brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their meet is grassfed and they after a great selection of vegetables to put in/on your food of choice,Food selection: They offer burritos,burrito bowls,I ordered: I bought a burrito bowl with half,For just a burrito bowl,small tacos,Price: The prices are a little,steak and half chicken,I had to pay almost $10 and that was without gauc and a bag of chips,25 for gauc and another payment if you want a bag of chips,because both Willys and Moes gives you chips for free,Location: This restaurant is located right next to Drunk Unicorn ,This Chipotle is located right at the corner of Ponce De Leon Place ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But if you're jonesing for a burrito,be filled with burrito-stuffings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ate dinner at this location and came down with food poisoning from a salad with steak,this is a growing trend across America and Chipotle can't be trusted in food quality,as my wife and I ordered the same thing except the meat,I can definitively point it to Chipotle's steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
crappy food,Today I order a cheese quesadilla with pinto beans ,and the guy literally says to me I don't want to put the pinto beans inside because it will get my grill messy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always been a great fan of this food,their quantities have really dropped in relation to the price you pay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Took me over 30 minutes to order 1 burrito last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I feel like if it's going to primarily be take out Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything tasted off ,Guac tasted old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now that's a chipotle bowl,They usually only give me one scoop of rice in my bowl,Chipotle is my favorite but this location skimps you on the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stared eating my food ,Just went to this chipotle,"He told me he would ""check the lettuce out""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Got tacos for the first, Paid bill realize they charge me went back to question it and was told and showed by Amanda and the manager in charge that it's extra and I explained that was why I asked and then only then did the manager asked the person who made my tacos , If you read the menu online it includes guacamole, Went through the line asked for guacamole was never told it was extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 After buying my regular burrito bowl ,with no gloves on) go into the tortilla chip bowl ,and continuosly just keep taking chips from the bowl ,The worst part of it all is the one at the register would go from register to bowl,register to bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is pretty,But then again I'm usually going out of my way because I'm craving a carnitas or barbacoa burrito,And it satisfies my burrito craving easily, solid in that it's your standard fare and quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is great,what I like about Chipotle is that they use naturally raised meats ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My family and I ate at this location yesterday- we all got food poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the two bowls I had ordered both had the hard,top of the avocado in the bowls we both bit on them n we knew it could only be that because neither one of use ordered meat,but I have ordered the salad that comes with the vinaigrette dressing twice now ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was able to order on line and they labeled all the food with the individual,Not a single thing was off and all was pretty delicious for fast foo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chance #1: two burrito bowls,Chance #2: two burritos on a road trip,two burrito bowls,I used to be a twice a week chipotle fanatic,sloppy chipotle,One bowl wasn't closed properly ,and spilled in the bag causing it to rip and bowls to fall while walking from car to apartment,Bag rips and bowl contents spill all over our carpet staircase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Such as ""just a little bit of salsa""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best burrito bol EVAR:," They deal with my pickiness (""just a LITTLE of the corn salsa",A LITTLE corn salsa,A TAD of the tomato salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always thought the meat here was saltier than at other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quincy was missing a burrito-only pla,"
burritos are definitely a bit more than they used to be",so i don't stick around once my burrito's in the bag,you're certainly not going to get haute cuisine at a chipotle,that maroon chipotle sign went up a mere, not chipotle's fault by any means, throw in some rice,pork and chicken,beans,they have a good selection of salsas (i,like mixing the mild and the roasted corn) and the hot salsa is actually hot,i usually go for whichever kind of meat looks the freshest,but they offer steak (2 kinds),cheese,and sour cream ,lettuce,but i can't say $14 - $15 for a delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The amount of food that was in the bowl was about half of what I usually get,The food didn't even reach the top of the bowl,I ordered chipotle to go ,I've been having many poor experiences with chipotle lately ,I also had a some uncooked rice pieces in the bowl,I also asked for extra corn ,and there was maybe half a scoop of corn ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
real food,Their crunchy tacos with chorizo or grilled chicken are my favorites,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe it just seems like common sense to me since I have worked in multiple food service jobs,As for the food itself,Looks like I will just have to stick with Falafel King if I am looking for my cheap Quincy food fix,The guy asking about cheese and sour cream proceeded to put mounds of each on my burrito even after I told him I wanted a little,the burrito was very dry, compared to other Chipotles and I struggled to get through it because of the ridiculous amount of sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The children preparing your food are such,"Offering to ""scrape things off"" after they've put too much or the wrong ingredient on your burrito or bowl",There are enough able bodied folks standing around putting chips in a bag for someone to mix up some dressing,And what irks me the most is they never have the salad dressing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018 around 1:20pm and there was this guy at the bar preparing the burritos,he was rushing to fill the burritos,and my burrito ended up being the size of a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is always good,Overall great fresh food , My usual is a mix chicken/steak bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it got into the food before they received it,What if the metal had been in my kids' food ,My family has had dinner here a few times a month over the last 3-4 years and the biggest complaint I've had during that time was the occasional too-messy burrito,I would give them 4 or 5 stars if it weren't for my most recent experience at this location: I was halfway through my sofritas burrito ,I get the concept but after finding a piece of a metal cleaning sponge in my mouth while trying to eat my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh,Probably my favorite chipotle spot in the city,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two stars is generous because the food is typically very edible, Like why are you taking beans off my burrito ,I get if anything salsa on the side so my soggy burrito doesn't become soggier as the salsa has ton of water in it,My burrito had to be re,Why do I pay the same as someone who gets twice the same burrito,I get chicken, I like the chicken , Then this time they tried to charge me for salsa on the side, The chips this time were stale,Got chips- See the pics, Turned out chips were crap,cheese ,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good food,What on Earth do they put in that chicken,The salad is wonderful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my friends and I used to cut across the drag to the Chipotle and destroy our 1 lb burritos all in one sitting,I can't deny my love for these burritos,I think it's the cilantro lime rice,that rice is pure,once it's all been wrapped up in that ginormous tortilla or assembled in your bowl,The chicken ,)  The salsas are just alright, And their guacamole is almost as good,and steak are my favorites,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I wanted a little tomatoes but the employees didn't listen and slammed the entire bucket on my bowl, Management is horrible- I wanted my husband's cheese quesadilla xtra crispy ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I crave your food everyday, Your food makes me smile, Thank you for good food , *sigh* okay I have to go now because it is almost lunch time and I have a 1/2 hour drive to get some of your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I'm addicted to the food,I've contacted Chipotle about these issues and they wrote back and basically told me that this is a special location because some customers try to take advantage of extra items in their burritos so they have to be stingy with all customers,Even though I arrived a little early my burrito was cold,At this location I've been told things I've never heard of like I can't have extra rice ,I've tried ordering on the app to avoid the long wait times but they are even more stingy with the ingredients when you're not there while they're making it and have done things like not given me extra chicken even though I requested it ,Every time I ask for double meat they just put a few,40 for extra cheese ,They are very stingy with their ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is Chipotle quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ignored instructions for my burrito,Hardly wrapped our burritos,Refused to make more tacos 2hrs before closing time,added things I didn't ask for and forgot to add ingredients I requested,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then I told him I'd come down and bring back the rest of my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she stares back down in the food ,Ricky orders a burrito ,and he's off to make the world's best burrito,I order a burrito bowl,all the ingredients of a burrito bowl are printed as big,rice,the female building my bowl seems really really lost,When she was handed my bowl by the ordering dude,pinto beans,Sos I say I'll take the tomatillo salsa so I can get the frak out of there,steak,she just stood there looking down into the vast ingredient choices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I love really any Mexican-inspired food,I gotta say that my order is a chicken burrito,but the burrito is pretty much,brown rice,I will mix it up at get a bowl or salad,black beans,their pinto beans are made with bacon,No salsa,no meat,if you get an item with no meat,80 for guacamole - ,they are not to charge you for guacamole,cheese,sour cream,lettuce ,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and most don't allow employs to make their own food,We went here to get burritos on Sunday,however an employe was making her self a burrito,when he finally arrived he started my burrito ,After getting our rice we had to wait again for another employe to come and finish our burritos,We eat at chipotle at least twice a month,Then they ran out of rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and wouldn't shut up long enough for her to finish our food nor for him to ring it up,I'm a Freebirds convert (half-birds don't leave me feeling ridiculously full with a quarter burrito waste leftover) ,"the cashier kept making jokes a la Stewie Griffin of ""Family Guy"" to the girl making our burritos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the most inefficient chipotle store ive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food here was cold, I had the tacos ,and the shells were not even warm I still have the bad taste in my mouth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was really good,They heaped our burrito bowl so full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I don't need to feel like I'm at one while I eat burritos,but it's tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so when she went to pick it up is was not ready they were obviously busy cuz their food is so great,Even though there was a little glitch Chipotle is still our #1 lunch spot great people great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If I could give this chipotle a negative,unfortunately it's not an option I've been coming there for seven years and over the past two but has declined in service in quantity by 100% this place Does not pride themselves on customer service or quality go somewhere else if you can this chipotle is awful,I'm actually eating their stale chips and hard rice right no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always choose to get a bowl instead of a burrito since the bowl is less messy,The burrito is a  great,I get a bowl with white rice,chicken,black beans,It has a great texture and taste that is great to eat with their chips,and lettuce with a side of guacamole,Their guacamole is one of the best I've tasted,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On my way to chipotle at the south,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have tried the burritos ,I like the steak bowl and I always get it when I stop at this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Usually chipotle is a better deal than any other,responsibly sourced meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sometimes ordering offline you will end up with a burrito instead of a burrito bowl or no cheese,they use some organic beans,and their meat is hormone ,great for my man who does it meat even if I do not,delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just never know what Quality of food you'll get, Still love chipotle like mad,Like undercooked rice or very under seasoned meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My 10yr old daughter wanted to go up & order some chips & guacamole,I watched 3 employees look right past her even though she was holding a cc in her hand & asked nicely for some chips & guac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a great place and I always go for the double meat where I get Chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tasty and healthy food,Quick made & prices are reasonable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Quality of the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrific food,It is a little crunchy but the food is still good,The only slight negative is that their rice (both brown ,I usually get the chicken bowl which is delish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today I ordered a burrito over the phone,a super simple one with just white rice,chicken,black beans,and additional cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I eat at chipotle all the time,and have soggy/old lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didn't have enough meat on my taco to even cover the bottom of the shell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can absolutely make the argument that it is not real Mexican food,There is a time for authentic Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I arrived the food wasn't ready,it was a little annoying because I specifically ordered it ahead of time so I wouldn't have to spend 10 minutes of my break waiting to get food,Eventually she took my order receipt to the staff working the food line ,The food line then proceeded to create burritos ,If I wanted to wait 10+ minutes for food than I would have just done that,and bowls for the line of physical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50 for a burrito ,tacos or bowls,Having a chipotle near by is like magic,Prices,Then you choose your carb - white or brown rice ,First you choose your protein -chicken ,and black or pinto beans ,99 you can add guacamole,",steak ",cheese ,sour cream lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After leaving immediately I searched yelp for burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You'll get your food just very VERY Very slow,It's 4:27 and out of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Decent food,Decent prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But I can't help but feel like it's a passive-aggressive signal that they really want me to take my food ,I think people who rave about it probably live in places without Mexican food,I got my barbacoa burrito and,and in Austin we don't have many places that serve burritos,Rice in a burrito,watery liquid was draining out from my burrito,I guess the water from the salsa was mixing with the water from the beans,though I'm not sure if the watery salsa runoff will make it too gross,but it mixed with my sour cream to make an unappetizing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never experienced this with any other chipotle,Ordered online a salad and bowl,napkins or dressing for my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ive been coming to this chipotle for a couple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both times greeted with smiles and delicious and clean food,I come to this chipotle often,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I worked there for 2 years at the congress location and I know the Quality of food it needs to be ,and their chips are just god,I called them the first time about a month ago to let them know their chips were nasty,Well its 2 pm a month later and I still get stale chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 burritos ,its rice + meat + a veggie salsa (really a chipotle sauce,SEVEN WORDS: Recent Price Jump,They used to have huge servings at low prices,and then wrap it in a soft tortilla or dump it in a bowl,and guacamole,You can also top it with sour cream,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burritos are huge and they go liberal on sour cream and sauces so a burrito is calorifically a lot,Beans and guacamole are not bland and they had a zing to it which made burrito lot tastier,i would recommend getting queso on the side not on burrito to control the burrito going too heavy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same quality food you can expect from the fine,which for some reason charges an additional tax that raises my burrito price ~$0, I just came for a burrito,com/biz/chipotle-mexican-grill-atlanta-4#hrid:8DrkVJsYDeUjTxZ0k6wnCQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had the steak burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
super sweet and I can't say I've ever left a food establishment so content,This is my favorite chipotle to go to out of all central,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food seemed bl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After choosing my rice she asked what type of meat I wanted,I asked for a vegetarian bowl,As she moved down the line filling the bowl she looked so disinterested,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll give it 2 stars because the food was good,I ordered a chicken bowl and three soft shell tacos,After she partially made the bowl she got the three tacos ,I said I wanted chicken ,and black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the only time I have ever had to wait there and then when the beef was ready they gave me the burrito free,chips ,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Since I was having a veggie burrito she even offered more bean,She also offered to put my free guacamole on the side because I did not want it on my burrito,This was another fantastic experience at this chipotle, and rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and made the food poorly,You make burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered two VEGAN burritos bowls online,""" Received my burrito bowls 1 hour ",fix up chipotle, and received steak on one and chicken on the other,I'm guessing it's significantly harder to put two separate  styles of meat of each rather than a scoop of the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was cold,But other than that i never had a problem i love there food ,I love chipotle espeically this location,I would choose chipotle over almost any fast,and there white rice is the bomb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is pretty,and I love the option to put a burrito in a bowl for the same,mostly because its basically Moe's for the same price, price (because they usually give you more that way,I do wish they gave more salsa,they have cilantro and REAL salsa,Tortilla chips are actually pretty cheap,The meat is usually pretty,and it tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food ,They have great food ,This has become a growing trend with chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amazing food--perfect for families,rice,chicken/pork,Love that the kid's meals are filled with beans,salsa,cheese, Fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They gave him a side Portion in a cup and my husband came back to the table feeling better about his food,Adding the meet to his food we got back into the talking ,But when as we all started to eat there was a deep lack of chicken on my husbands burrito bowl ,Today the family wanted to stop and eat here and I knowing that we all could pick something to make us all happy the price was worth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bomb food,the meat is better at this chipotle compared to the one at the loop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Second time my order was completely wrong ordered chicken bowl with rice,corn rice,   Got no chicken,Green peppers and black beans,cheese mild salsa ,no cheese,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We waited in line for awhile for our chicken burritos however,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like their salsa,Love their chips--they are sprinkled with lime ,Why aren't their freaking chips free,All of the other meats are too much,I do like their steak here,This steak is kind of too tough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One is heavy other is a little less heavy when it comes to weight of food,Taco Bell is there if you are broke but want a descent burrito,with extra items and little bit price difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I switched to ordering online to avoid talking to these people but recently when I picked up my burrito bowl,Worst chipotle location,Some times the rice/, beans are so salty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not very tolerant of spicy food),They made my taco pretty fast,The taco itself was pretty decent,The nacho chips were great, though and the guacamole was pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It didn't help that there was a crazy women slowing the line down because she didn't understand the concept of a burrito, I feel like a vegetarian would have been fine eating my chicken bowl because there wasn't much, chicken to be found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dont get me wrong i love chipotle and the food is great,The only problem is every time i go they give me very small portions of the food ,From now on i try to avoid this place just because of the workers and ive been to several chipotles ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but what is even better than the food is their friendly,Am addicted to their chicken burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Usually I get the veggie burrito bowl, Their corn salsa is still slightly sweet,but I got steak today , Chips still have that nice lime flavor and it just tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had been coming more often since my partner and I received 4 coupons collectively from the Taste of Atlanta for two free burritos,sometimes they skimp on how much they give you in the burrito bowls,I love chipotle,as I saw many people before me get bowls filled to capacity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is still good,She makes you feel bad that you are ever ordering food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is a spot in my heart for Chipotle even though its a major chain burrito place,The reason I like Chipotle over the local burrito places,I once went in at 10:30 not paying attention to the time and they made my burrito ,They have also re-rolled my burrito plenty of times ,and I love how they offer brown rice now,The second is the salsa's are very bland,The steaks is chunks of steak and not a shredded mystery meat,but the corn is alright,is that I feel they use superior ingredients,The pico lacks that homemade taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the food isn't great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not hard to roll a burrito,surprisingly the staff at this chipotle location does NOT know how to roll one at al,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle has great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you see the hipster looking gentleman with the glasses and wizard-like facial hair working behind the burrito/chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consistent great customer service and amazing food every time,It's something about the inexpensive burrito bowl,I don't know who invented the burrito bowl,cilantro rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The meat has been dry the last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a bowl with rice,The bowl was only half,extra guacamole with no beans,cheese,sour cream,no lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love it because their burrito holds me until 8:00pm dinner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steak is cooked perfect and their food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are decent,for the price,I have to say Taco Bell items are kinda better except for their melted cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once inside the food line was missing a few,after knocking a nice gentleman eating his food got up to let him in,I looked to the employees on the food line ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This time though I ordered a burrito bowl with chicken,"We had to drive back to this location because the chicken was ""gummy"" ",so I got the steak instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burrito bowl is fantastic,I like the steak with extra meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,but sometimes when you just want a big loaded burrito Chipotle is superior, but they have overcooked my meat a few,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When you order a veggie bowl at least give us enough rice,I asked for extra sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food quality is spot-on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also on frequent occasions their are characters loitering outside of your store asking people for money or food,just the burrito ,Thank you for cranking good burritos at a totally fair,cheap and somewhat nutritious delicious burrito ,I appreciate the reasonable price point , price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and the ""food with integrity"" philosophy is an added",Most fast burrito places give you a small,I'm a big fan of the burrito bowl with carnitas,The burritos ,and burrito bowls come with white, I don't mind the price tag because a burrito bowl is enough,Chipotle is my favorite of the fast food burrito places  bonus, or brown cilantro lime rice ,They also have chicken,and vegetarian black beans or pinto beans (I love options), Chips and salsa are not included so you have to ask for them on the side,The meat comes entirely from naturally raised livestock farms ,teaspoon of guacamole atop your meal, Put your guacamole worries to rest as you order at Chipotle,steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love that they make the food right in front of you ,and the food is always fresh,two soft shell tacos with chicken,black beans,cheese ,and sour cream,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 they make it right in front of you so you can tell them how much of each ingrediant to put on it (me-lots of pico very little beans)  i thought the price was super cheap for the quality/quantity of food, and i was thinking that eating just a burrito is gonna do nothing for me because i was hungry, so i got the burrito , but let me tell you my burrito was sooooo delicious,and chips, my husband ate up the chips (i could only fit about 2)  soooooo good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a half handful of cheese and black beans ,all four salsas (in place of dressing),I love Chipotle - the salad here is the best,Would love if they had a tofu option for my salad- I don't love the pepper vegetarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is always undercooked,This is definitely the worst chipotle location in Atlanta,The Sandy Springs location on Roswell road is the best chipotle in the atlanta,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my Barbacoa bowl is swimming in the sauce because they were too lazy,Keep in mind in my picture I had to ask for double meat because the portion I was allocated was laughable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the most inefficient chipotle store ive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Best burrito for the price,The best - i recommend the chicken bowl with rice & blackbeans, I love cilantro so the medium sauce and the corn is an excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ruins the chipotle name,No forks or chips 8 pm on a Saturday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It may not be the most authentic Mexican food around,I can now get my massive burrito fix,it's really hard to live somewhere you can't get your hands on one of their big fat burritos,The menu is limited to a variety of burritos,tacos and burrito bowls- ,Just place your order at the counter and the line of servers will custom build a burrito to your specifications,"Most of my friends go straight for ""five pound"" burrito",but the burrito BOWL is my favorite,which include all the usual suspects: rice,The meat and veg are served in a bowl without the tortilla shell,beans,Three types of salsa are available,but the meat ,guacamole,cheese ,sour cream, and each one is different and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good quality food,The line goes very slow and I had to keep asking for more lettuce as the lady only would put a few,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they also put called in orders before my friends and made 30 burritos and made us wait 20 minutes before my friends could get their food,the girl making my tacos messed up my order which is very underst,but I corrected her after she started putting chicken on my tacos without asking what meat I want ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All I remember is they had a Chipotle-eating contest where if you finished 4 burritos,you got a free shirt or free burritos,The chicken is off the hook,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was great, Our orders were correct and our bowls were full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went back again today only because of the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had the steak tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had also ordered a salad from their online ordering system and they gave me so much food that half a bowl was left on the lid after I finished it,Best chipotle i've ever been to,but here they are so nice and don't get irritated when you ask for something like I feel other chipotle employees do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I love knowing what is in my food,burrito or bowl, My mom ordered a burrito bowl,taco,I ordered a taco because I wasn't super,and rice, She raved about her bowl even though she thought the mild, salsa was hot,hormone infested meats so I stopped in with my mom a couple days ago,salad, I would come back and order the salad with pinto,I watched the owner on KGW talk about using local ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Found several pieces of bone in my bowl, Food quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went to sit and quickly eat my food,Oh - second star is only because the food was fine,I walked in & asked for a burrito bowl for here,I told her I was starving so I looked at what was left and figured out a way to still make myself a satisfying burrito bowl,"albeit sans two of my usual ingredients (or lettuce - the ""out of"" included brown rice",the price is fine,""" bc they have a bowl option that is incredibly similar",rather than have her go through the effort of scooping ingredients into a bowl one more time (for,although she oddly had me repeat my choices of black beans and chicken,and I think some meat option(s)),lettuce,corn,") The girl promptly listed off a BUNCH of ingredients they were ""out of"" (read: they decided to stop ""making"" it for the night",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was consistent,Virtually every table had food debris on it while the garbage cans were overflowing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It was ok with their food order,when I came back at the second time and I notice the rice was cold with my steak burrito order, The first time that I have been to this place and they did not listen carefully to make sure request extra ingredients on my order but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got the barbacoa burrito ,gave my burrito some kick, I was surprised how well my burrito was put together,it never fell apart and I ate 3/4 of the burrito on an early,black beans,and the best salsa ever -- it was medium,of meat ,guacamole (add extra $),and stuffed it with sour cream, spiciness and chock full of grilled corn ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd love to have a carnitas burrito every day,low-carb bowl with black,chicken, beans,fresh salsa,and guacamole,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm always happy when I get a good burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and Melissa thank you all for taking part in creating the best burrito I've ever had,I've been to many chipotle locations in my quarter century on this earth ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I have no problem with the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i told my mom i was taking her to fast mexican food & she was extremely skidish, great food,she lives at the coast (they don't have chipotle there) & everytime,great price,taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get 3 tacos with hard,chicken ,and mild salsa,I love the chips here,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which seems to be more food for the same,The burrito wrapping is something I've had unpleasant,where best case scenarios have the employee re-wrapping one that is slightly torn to burritos so loosely wrapped that they barely hold together,So I started just getting the burrito bowls,with the occasional employee who holds back on rice, price,beans,or meat,The quality of the ingredients is quite good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe one day corporate will care enough to make food safety ,How in the world can a location run out of lettuce,And the manager was laughing when I asked what he was going to do to compensate me for not having lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I was so disappointed by the food & service tonight,so I didn't get a good look at my food until I got home,I ordered a bowl to go,in my bowl,"and the ""guacamole"" had a huge",95 for guacamole,I expect guacamole,the cheese was clumpy,There were also pieces of dried hard corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We both were planning on ordering the crispy tacos which is on their menu, I chalked this up to bad management that a Mexican restaurant would be out of taco shells no less, Two weeks later we go again ask for crispy tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,I usually have the veggie burrito with fajitas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is very good,This chipotle is a bit small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's good food, Don't ask for extra sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wouldn't start over and so now we are eating cold food,They put the rice ,Didn't cover my rice ,I ordered 2 bowls with steak to go,and beans in ,and beans,and then told me it would be 5 minutes for steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came arounBecause they had 2 girls working register and assembling burritos,Double meat everywhere else is 2 scoop,Same goes for guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I compensated with extra salsa, The meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All I asked for was for them to put a tortilla on the bottom of my burrito bowl,Worst service I have ever received at any chipotle,a request I have made at every chipotle I've ever been to from here to Virginia,Then with one final hard glance my way I was at last finished with the worst chipotle employees I've ever experienced,Now 2 full minutes later I at least had a tortilla in my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a burrito from this place ,And the rice,white rice with some chopped,The chicken was overpowered by the salty adobo sauce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is ALWAYS on point the service is mostly on point ,From the salad dressing to the rice,.delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is inconsistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is consistent, My husband generally goes for a burrito,while I opt for the burrito bowl,and we are also fans of the delicious and flavorful guacamole, with the Chipotle brand standards and delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fresh food,The salads are our favorite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered food to be delivered ,but twice to speak to a manager in regards to my $10 bowl that equals maybe $4 with the amount of food I got,I have never been so disappointed with a chipotle,To the point I had a pool of sour cream on the sides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I splurged and got a bag of chips , Their chips are so much better than most any Mexican, I hate it when it has that rancid taste like it's been sitting for days, Chipotle's Ice Tea tasted fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Personable staff who get the food right consistently,This was by-far the best Chipotle experience I've had since my inaugural first bite of their burritos,I had my typical Chicken Burrito - spicy and extra sour creamy,Where most's quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I watched as the worker scooped very generous portions of meat and vegetables into his burrito which was odd as I typically have to fight for more than 5 pieces of chicken,"However when they told me it would be ""about 15 minutes"" for chips for my chips ",and guacamole I guess my face said it all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My kids loved their taco kit too,reasonbly priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've generally found the food ,"words to the effect of: ""Our burritos are big",I can't tell a significant difference between a burrito at Chipotle ,and a burrito at Moe's or Willy's -- they all taste good,burrito bowls,Like other burrito joints, You control what goes into your burrito from the very beginning,One of my favorite items to get is the burrito bowl because it's simple, I usually load my burrito bowls with all available,tacos,and salads range in price from $6, Cilantro-lime rice, I'm a fan of the rice, Meats include chicken, I like to get chicken or steak, The chicken is surprisingly tender,black beans,pinto beans,salsa,particularly corn salsa ,and spicy salsa (in addition to the st, The spicy salsa is indeed spicy, Chipotle takes pride in its naturally raised meats,65 per order depending on the meat selection,so you can see all the meats , All of the meats aren't bad,steak,cheese,sour cream,particularly corn  ,and other ingredients being prepared ,it's possible for the ordering line to run out of certain ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the the food isn't consistently good,the rice tasted old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One time there was a bug in my bowl,they were nice enough to give me a free bowl so I decided to give them another chance,They have also been out of chips the past,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It's the rice,corn salsa ,When it comes to the war on Burritos Chipotle's stolen my heart and taste buds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We are gonna go here because the food is already great,I went in here the other night and ordered two bowls and a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
service is fast and my burrito was tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not the first time in chipotle in Mass that happened,Mild salsa was so hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was excellent,great food,I have been wanting to try chipotle for quite a while now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its real convenient for me and the food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think this chipotle is fantastic,The servers tend to lean on the more generous side of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,The chicken burrito in a bowl is usually my choice , Their chips are light,Have you ever had the heavy chips at some places,They just taste like grease,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food prep line is usually friendly,I've been to this chipotle a couple of times,when I PAY FOR chips and salsa,I expect there to be more than 10 chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As for the food,The food does taste good,this is one of the few Chipotles that has consistently messed up rolling my burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they cant mix the salted rice well enough,so in one area of the rice it extremely salty ,also the steak was terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not exactly authentic Mexican food which my Mexican,The barbacoa is the most amazing meat ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The WORST chipotle I've EVER been to ,and I loooove chipotle,I drive 10 minutes out of my way to go to the chipotle on Braintree,Half-cooked gross chicken is pretty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Since we only had limited time we opted to grab our food to go,I tried Chipotle a few weeks ago with some of the burrito crazed guys I work with (they swear by it),My burrito that day was def a 1 star,I had the opp to try a burrito one way (on my not so tasty, Def enough to give a 2 star burrito joint,burrito was pretty good, I recommend going in when the Daryl look-alike is working and and ordering a burrito , first trip) and adjust the filling to my taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when I first tried Chipotle I HATED it until I found the burrito bowl ,and chips ,How does a restaurant that basically has 10 main items run out of one of them especially when all of their competition gives chips with a meal ,We sat down to eat the meal and just as we are about to leave we see a group of employees come out to eat and they all have heaping bags of chips,but if you are telling the customers you are out of ships it is ridiculous for those same people to now come out with overly filled bags of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Out of steak,Got fresh steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the salad and my friend the burrito bowl,She didn't even get a full scoop of rice ,and neither of us got much meat at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fine,Its like pulling teeth to get more than a few pieces of cheese ,and lettuce on anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm so sorry our food allergy interrupted your food line,Get rid of the attitude and welcome to the food service industry where it is service with a smile,etc in my bowl,She barely put any beans,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which meant that the food had been sitting out for awhile,but hopefully next time the food is a bit fresher,#1 - I love chipotle,#3 - their guacamole is the BOMB ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always great,The chicken is my favorite, and the guacamole is worth the extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food did not taste like any of the other, We ordered a burrito,chicken salad and two kids burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I barely got any food,the food tasted,So disgusted with this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito is always my go-to,but the burritos always seem to bigger,always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to sneer at the faux-Mexican food, If you want real Mexican or real Latin food,5 black bean burritos ,and a chicken burrito bowl later,17 barbacoa tacos, Food doesn't necessarily have to be authentic to a particular remote region of the world to taste good,tasteless rest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went into chipotle today ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but despite that I still like the chain and its burritos more than any of the other,burrito chains,The burrito bowl in particular,my burrito bowl was perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their super burrito is a challenge to finish,I'd get some napkins because the burrito is so jam,packed that it turns into a burrito bowl in your palms,Disclaimer: The giant burrito is about 1200 calories so if you do what I do,I get full at the 90% mark and see no point saving 10% --and I definitely wouldn't consider discarding it -- so I loosen a notch in my belt and keep going til every bean and rice granule is in my tummy,It comes in $9 with all the trimmings (guacamole ,and sour cream),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I give this chipotle 1 star because of them messing up our online,I love chipotle , I still love chipotle ,The easiest order by only putting 2 of 3 (meat rice ,and salsa ,but no salsa) ingredients,We got 3 orders of chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why even be open if you aren't going to have any food,Literally we waited 20 minutes in line and the people in front of us barely had anything in their bowls or burritos - totally not worth the money, They had absolutely no rice (brown or white,no chicken,and no chips or guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food ,The food is always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Picked up an online order of 8 salads / bowls at this location,- All of salads / bowls were only half,Literally everyone on our team was disappointed the second they opened their bowl,because this place skimps on literally every ingredient - just look at the picture of my salad bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Usually it's because the people I go with don't appreciate burritos of a better kind (Willy's,I ordered a burrito bowl,5 large scoops of rice +,while I received only 1 scoop of rice ,when my bowl reached the end of the assembly line,so I ate the whole bowl,beans,and beans,need to give you more ingredients,What I really should have done was bitch and ask for more ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always fast and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the shear size of the burrito is truly daunting,Always so much better for me to have that hold the rice,They make up for the lack of rice by adding double, beans,sour cream and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Like my burrito bowl was half the size it should be,The most recent time I went the rice was undercooked,Also my friend who was gluten-free only got beans and tomatoes and lettuce had a super small bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also did not enjoy my food because the chicken was too salty,I am obsessed with chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had to wait an extra minute because they were in the process of making fresh guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 But the food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think the ingredient quality of Chipotle has decreased though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality is not consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle's burrito , I give 4 stars because the last burrito I ate,the rice was uncooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is the first of their kind to do clean food as they do,its always great to grab a beer or margarita with Mexican food,I hope Chipotle keeps up their unconventional standards in comparison to other businesses and over all continues to crush the Mexican grilled food,and completely fair prices is what keeps my respects for Chipotle steep,local ingredients,Never lack of flavor in any of their ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the men's room usually needs attention and the steak is often tough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Should be acting as if I've never been to chipotle before,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is really good,Other than that the one is Reading has been one of the best chipotles I have been to employee wise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-steak,-cheese,-lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the chips are stale and the food is strangely bl,I have to come home and douse my burrito bowl with sriracha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the most inefficient chipotle store ive,i uave been back to chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've been a fan of chipotle for years now ,and i went vegetarian about 7 months ago and chipotle still hasn't lost me as a customer,chipotle forever,"they're ""sofritas"" tofu option instead of meat is delicious",i love that i can eat cruelty free and with their fresh ingredients still,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But occasionally you get a little less food than the st,Suffice it to say I came back because I LOVE the carnitas burrito,http://www.chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And I am just talking about the food,There are much much better chipotle's in the world,The salsa is watery,The meat is room temp,The lettuce is wilting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really good fresh food that lives up to the st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and u fortunate for me because I always add lemon to my bowl,they are extremely light on the toppings (the cheap ones like tomatoes and lettuce),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually go for the burrito bowl instead of a burrito (seems like you're getting a little more value with the bowl),and the lime salted chips are a nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location can even fold my burrito so it doesn't fall apart after one bite (other,The only things holding this chipotle back from 5 stars are the small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They definitely cover the rice with lemon,I couldn't finish my bowl because it just tasted like lemo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(I do not agree with a review I read about their food being BLAND,the food's seasoning is well balanced,and I like the fact I can see the food being prepped right there in the line,Their food is well seasoned  the rice is cooked properly ,because is cheap good food place that serves alcohol ,I had bought a steak bowl , I recommend the steak salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Asked for a quesadilla with meat the girl didn't even let me finish talking before she moved on to the next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the last time I waste money on food here that I can't eat because of how awful,My burrito is drowning in a mooshy,Extra white rice,I ask for only a little of mild salsa ,and sour cream, tomato and sour cream soup,and and they're so bad  at portions that it makes what normally tastes so good,taste disgusting,it tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is tasty nutritional food at a low,where they make the burrito/burrito, bowl/tacos in front of you, price,Fresh vegetables and good meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unfortunately the food was also sad,Perhaps the service and food will get better ,Normally chipotle is a two meal minimum for me,I ordered chips ,and guacamole to accompany my salad and the chips were old,And the newbie serving me was very conservative with portions so the salad was actually on the small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always excellent,I have terrible food allergies ,The manager often gives us a free bag of chips or drink,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is pretty, While assembling my burritos the workers were chatting , I telling them what I wanted in my burrito , I only come here when I crave chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The server couldn't spare the lettuce nor the chicken,did not come close to any other Chipotle serving of chicken either in Houston or in Austin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$40 worth of burnt food,So Burt that we couldn't even eat any of our food at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ask for plain rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location is fast friendly and the food is fresh,it can add up to 8 or 9 bucks a burrito pretty quickly,but its a MASSIVE burrito for the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Later on that day this turned into full on food posing,I haven't had but a bowl of soup and a few crackers since I ate chipotle,I ordered a chicken bowl with brown rice,The lady making my bowl asked for a new bin of brown rice ,She dumped the remainder of the old chicken in with the new and the brown rice want ready,yet so I got the remainder of the brown rice,About an hour or so after eating my chicken bowl my stomach was turning over ,and chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is by far the best chipotle ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 This specific location is kept clean and food is consistently well prepared,but the burritos ,and tacos are yummy,Steak marinated in tobasco sauce makes one hell of a taco (or three), The chips and green chili salsa are delicious, and tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very simple burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the employees clearly take no pride in the quality of their restaurant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our family has been loyal Chipotle customers for many years and across multiple states because of the food quality ,It is really frustrating when you order tour food in advance,We've tried giving the benefit of the doubt because we like Chipotle food,We will drive an extra 10 minutes to get our order right and NOT charge us for food we never receive,And it is often something quick to cook like chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have two of he saddest looking burrito bowls I've ever ordered,While this was disappointing because I met the requirements of the coupon (I purchased a full priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they gave me medium salsa instead of mild which I specifically asked for,2 of the 3 people I interacted with were nice and helpful but one girl wasn't and seemed annoyed that they had just run out of steak ,and that it was terrible of me for wanting to wait until I could have steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food was so bad,but this food was truly gross,we would have returned all of this food for a refund,The burrito tasted like soft,the rice was oily,the pinto beans looked like something from our dog that we would scoop up,gross and bland with hardly a cheese flavor and the chips were old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's like the employees save the food for themselves after work or something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was also a large chips ,and big guacamole,We got home and found my salad had no lettuce,We felt so good about everything that we forgot about the missing lettuce that started the whole,He was apologetic and offered a replacement salad,efficient and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my kids love the burritos,I love chipotle,the bowls are best,and the guacamole is awesom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love their bowls,I wish they would charge less for the guacamole because I'd like a smaller amount than they give,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
scooping and plopping pre-prepared(probably much from the factory these days) food onto a bowl,The food wasn't anything special,then the food is merely passable,and desperate to get past the days of food-borne,and set itself apart as a genuinely new experience with the promise of fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't know how to wrap a burrito ,I used to like chipotle a lot more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not the fastest or cleanest chipotle I've been in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's also a great plus that it's not far from my home and they're on Doordash on days I'm at work and hankering for a burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go to this location because they always have the freshest ingredients and the chicken is cooked perfectly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was as expected for the br,The only reason for not giving 5 stars is that they accidentally gave us an extra guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I ordered food from here ,very simple chips , When I started eating my chips they were as stale,all I could taste was those nasty old stale chips,and guacamole,Dont even get me started with the brown guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sucks cause I love Chipoltle food, Baja has better tasting chicken anyway,But tell my why it is acceptable that the girl spooning up the meat/veggies ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked if I could place my order some food,I ended up ordering at Chili's across the street and got food in 20 minutes,Chipotle is supposed to be a place to quickly grab food,I don't see what the problem was with quickly tossing a burrito together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We can't have meat in our food,not only for ethical reasons but also it is against our religion to eat meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so no food for me ,Keep in mind that this is a very expensive food,with cilantro lime rice ,but the rice looked just plain,I ordered a carne asada bowl,I had to cancel the bowl as I had a tight,was going to order a bowl,they gave me a steak quesadilla that was left in the maker for over 10 minutes,therefore it was hard and with no signs of cheese in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered chipotle online and walked in to pick up the food,ordering food without masks on within a foot away from the food,I felt uneasy eating their food ,and worried if their food is safe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my burrito typically runs me back 6,i took my adult son tyler(age 37)to the local high street chipotle to hit on some colledge age babes,The money hungry suits at chipotle raised the price of chicken by five cents,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You might as well go to white caste across the street if you're looking for the best food in the area,My dog ate a piece of my burrito then proceeded to lick her own,The white rice looked more like cottage cheese,I legitimately think I could throw some salt and pepper on a dog turd and it would taste better than their chicken,my mom actually hand fed me mashed pinto beans from Chipotle before I even had teeth, a**h**** just to get the bad taste out of her mouth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,they made my burrito bol with good, amounts of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
usually out of at least 1 ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You get a large portion of healthy tasting food that you can custom tune to your taste  ,Everything fresh and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sometimes the food is cold,Paid extra for double meat on a delivery order and the burrito was about half the size as normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The people working there act like the food ,and toppings they are supposed to put on the burrito or bowl is coming out of their pockets ,You have to keep asking them to put more chicken which should be the original amount at ANY other chipotle,I will not be going to this chipotle location anymore ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Even though there were two closer locations we would drive further to come here because the food , Not sure what's going on with the management at this location but I think something happened and someone needs to step up and quality control the food, The rice in the bowl was soggy, Our bowls we ordered were not much,and salsa's were good, On our last visit the salsa's were not good, Similarly with the hot salsa it looked orange/ brown,salsa etc, It tasted like it was chopped up days earlier with no seasoning , not red and just didn't taste right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today I went to chipotle after my lecture and I sat in line soooo long waiting for my food,Also my food was amazing,This lady had an order of what had to be easily 15-20 burritos all with different,and quickly to complete this large order even tho she seemed really confused as to what goes inside each burrito ,I want to commend the crew at this chipotle for working together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I paid $12 for my bowl and got half of what I'm used to from chipotle,The rice was cold,Measly portions to fill the bowl,beans were cold,The steak was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I order pickup or delivery so I don't see them getting the food,I've had better chipotle from other,I order the salad bowl,I order it a lot thinking it would taste better ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my burritos always get expertly crafted,I've seen plenty of instances where they will re-wrap an exploded burrito,Try some jalapeno tabasco on your burrito next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not bad very simple veggies and meat options are very limited,recommend u go to cabo bobs better quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sometimes this slightly older lady skimps (really skimps) on the food ,I don't know how skimping on a couple pieces of meat is worth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoyed my bowl with chicken ,salsa verde (,and all the good stuff in it:lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Took me 30 minutes to get my food ,This is the absolute worst chipotle I have ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is fresh,The burritos are HUGE snd delicious,I try to stay away from the rice,just because it's rice,I figure if I'm going to get a salad I'm  not going to throw rice in it,I like to get a salad bowl with chicken,The chips have fresh, I like the guacamole too,tomatoes and a little cheese,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I order a vegetarian bowl,I don't expect to find chicken in it,only to bite into chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overall took 15 minutes of standing there and being persistent to get my food,The employees are often talking while serving your bowl or seem to be entertained doing anything ,The girl angrily started remaking my bowl before walking away in anger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a bowl online and they gave me no food,I could see the bottom of the bowl on one side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I did a pre order and asked for double white rice ,and it just wasn't the same without the rice,I was so disappointed because I was looking forward to this bowl all day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and excessively frugal with food,I had some tacos with steak ,protein does not a taco make,Part of the commotion was that quite a lot of liquid made its way into the tacos,the tacos didn't fall apart,At almost $10 for three tacos,"""brown rice or white",rice,I'd hope they wouldn't be counting pieces of steak and grains of rice (exaggerated,"""black beans or pinto""",beans,The steak was surprisingly good,while the steak fortunately did have an opportunity to shine through a bit,I'd hope they wouldn't be counting pieces of steak ,lettuce,crispier elements like lettuce,and the other ingredients caused it to fall flat,there were a little more careful as to how much ingredient they were placing,and being overly frugal with ingredients seems is contradictory,but other ingredients being unremarkable,I tried to give it a taste where it was still pure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One time an associate was not staying in his food section (e,instead of just doing tortillas/rice,on a positive note: if you want more rice/veggie,only applies to veggies/rice/sauces,I don't believe this is the case for meats,we ordered to-go and upon arrival found out there was a guacamole outage,The associate did mention to bring our receipt next time and we will get free guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've ordered from here a few times--sofritas or guac/veggie bowls ($7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the food,I order always the same chicken burito bowl with the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was wrong I ordered online a double meat Barbacoa burrito double,I received about 2 oz of beef and rice for days & beans galore,I had some chips added too, meat ,The double meat thing was the real,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
double rice,and extra cheese bowl ,This is less than what they typically give in a regular bowl,Ordered this double steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your food preparation for Door Dash clients is AWFUL, The first picture is a chicken bowl with supposedly extra, The bowl isn't even 1/2 full, chicken, The second picture is a salad,which you can't tell us even a salad unless you knew it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One burrito was half the size of the other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just stopped at this chipotle to get a bag of chips for a snack,I like there chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my burrito smelled like toilet water,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get two chicken tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is never on time if ordered via the app,and they refused to give the refund on the price difference,so they gave a different meat,I ordered carne asada steak via the app ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I gave them two stars because it's the same food you'd expect at a Chipotle,Almost every burrito I've gotten here has been soggy,Just not as good because they can't seem to drain the beans ,and meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I received a burrito that was so skimpy,I normally order a Veggie and get guac on the side (complementary to the veggie) with a side of chips,This is the only location to which I've been that charges me for chips aaa, the taste of the tortilla was most dominant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 But you should see the size of the burrito the blonde girl here made me tonight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoy this location the service is fast and food is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The experience is pretty much the same from each chipotle to another , I usually never ask for different amounts of my item when I get my bowl to see how consistent, I just wish I could ask for a Vegan bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get extra rice for my bowl and I've never ever had someone say I can only have 1 scoop of rice at chipotle,When I asked if I can have an extra scoop of rice,I can pay for extra rice if you gave me that option,but instead the lady just straight up told me no you can only have 1 scoop of rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't care that your burritos contain over 1000 calories,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I go I only get a chicken 3 pointer(which is just chicken and rice nothing else in it) ,and all they serve is HALF a spoon of rice which then they flatfoot to cover the empty,No ones asking for mounds of rice , spaces in the bowl ,and a couple of pieces of chicken,and chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
slopping food in your bowl, And the food always repeats on me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The meal felt a bit healthier with the brown rice,I got a shredded beef bowl ($10,it could just be dependent on the person making the bowl,fresh salsa ,and corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But still a fan of chipotle even tho They hosed me here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he passed along my soft tacos to the next,I LOVE chipotle,I used to frequent chipotle by my last,Shout out to the chipotle on Pine Ave in Long Beach,but as with most chipotles, person after the meat/beans part,Every ingredient I asked for she sloppily slammed down with attitude as fast as she possibly could (there was no one behind me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Felt very safe and food was very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Specifically the guy working the salsa/ lettuce station with the long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quality and portions of food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the food is alway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
please avoid this chipotle at all costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I regret coming to this chipotle it was just a bad,They were rude try to give me small portions of rice even after I insisted can you please put some more ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and there was meat mixed into my burrito bowl,as he ordered steak but it seemed odd that there were tiny pieces through out the burrito bowl,I ordered the vegetarian bowl,I ordered for pick up last weekend and there was cheese on my bowl,I thought maybe at first it could have flung it from my boyfriends bowl,so I don't eat meat or cheese,which has no meat or cheese on it unless you add it on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I highly don't recommend eating here unless u want ur food to be wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love you chipotle ,I love chipotle,chicken wasn't cut up into bite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inconsistent food quility:(,Seek other food options in the area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had an employee coughing while handling my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The positives to this trip and location is the food generally hot,an apology by the tortilla/bowl person ,They tend to give you nice size portions and I have yet to see them put a meat or a vegetable in my bowl ,(Yes I notice when the Bexley and Clintonville Chipotles take carnita meat off my bowl),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle used to be good,"Tonight I went there and I walked out because the person behind the counter gave me about a half an ounce of steak and about a quarter of an ounce of vegetables and she teased me with another quarter of a scoop of meat asking ""Do you want double the meat for an extra",but now they are trying to give you about a half an ounce of steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They shouldnt have old food laying around to serve,I usually like chipotle,She then mixed 2 half empty bags in order to give me a full bag for my large order of chips ,He had steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chipotle has officially lost my business,There was a little bit of steak left in the bin ,and I asked the gal if there was any fresh steak coming up soon-,the steak appeared over cooked,and dry (I was willing to wait for fresh steak),She turned around and asked the man on the grill how much longer steak would be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
During this time period I watched 3 people leave without their food because they obviously had better places to be (including a women in full,Once I got the food ,how is that possible that they are getting their food before people who ordered at 12:30,and finished explaining to my manager why I was late getting back to the office I noticed the bowl was missing 2 ingredients clearly outlined on the receipt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best chipotle out there ,They actually fill our bowls compared to other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first girl preparing food on the line kept coughing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 (No i'm not kidding)  Fast and good food, Got chicken tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and ""chipotle is life""",Chipotle is delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easily customizable food that fits macros ,Moderately priced,over-salted meat ,Consistently out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cashier was so bad he was charging me for 4 bowls ,We got our bowls home ,and I found a bone in my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
en este chipotle si que sirven muuy,delicioso mi bowl,el restaurante muy limpio y todos los utensilios y salsas en su lugar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food isn't properly h,I take my food,the young lady in question and another employee cooking the good discussing the incident in front of other customers and in the food line area,Today I stopped to pick up a burrito bowl, As I tell the  2nd young lady  who puts on the salsa etc what I would like we come to the corn salsa which is clearly low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm a regular at chipotle,I was using a reward and she told me the full price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The veggie bowl is packed with flavor ,just buy the chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent food I absolutely love chipotle they never fail me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but instead they gave me a side of the wrap used for a burrito instead,I also asked for a side of taco shells,I got the new carne asada steak because it was new,but it wasn't as Juicery as the regular steak they have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I used to like your food,I ordered a carnitas burrito with rice,00 burrito because it was so cold, I only ate half of my burrito because it had NO flavor, I ended up throwing my burrito away, I guess hard times call for skimpy bland burritos, What I got: A dinky serving of rice, The rice was bland,so little meat & way too much,corn & cheese,& a huge fistful of very cold cheese, cheese,a small spoonful of corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I filled a complete with Chipotle about the employee that was wearing plastics gloves that Chipotle provides to prepare food,she touched that dirty box and now is preparing my food,The line employee put on a new pair of gloves to prepare my burrito,but realized she did not have any burrito shells,Then prepared my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Second issue is the food quality,The manager should take a closer look to what kind of food is being offered ,I have requested two rice bowls to go with carne,The rice was uncooked,The bowls were unequal,As soon as I requested for the bowls to have the same,Only when I told him I just want equal portions and I don't care how much I will pay but you can't give me 6 pieces of meat on one bowl , it was still rock solid for the good 90% of the bowl,asada and chicken (half , to the amount of meat, portions (not one significantly less than the other) the employee said that it was his fault that he had more meat on the other,Only then he added more meat,The meat that I have revived was cold, it was not even slightly different temperature (sometimes if it sits too long under tomatoes or sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I just thought it was a one time thing but have been there many times since then as my son and I love the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll give it a couple stars for ease of ordering online and picking up food,I want to like this place because burritos,so why is my burrito sweet,I didn't get a mango or pineapple salsa,there's barely any meat,the meat doesn't even taste that great,They taste packaged ,It didn't taste like any carne,The grilled veggies tasted super,Guac is free and everything tastes so much better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Myself and 9 other people waited and waited for our food while people in the line zipped though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is always great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came home and my food tasted awful,If you're going to have horrible customer service and serve awful food,my bowl was TRASH,I knew when looking at the guacamole that it had been out all damn day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A few night ago we did an online order and the sticker on my bowl said ""chicken bowl"" ",and yet there was no chicken to be found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got the chicken burrito,The burrito was tiny,This was almost half the size of a regular burrito,I was so irritated by the experience that I called the manager who said I could get a free burrito the next,The chicken tasted old,the chicken was old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then I watch the same guy serve the man next to me and give him three times as much food,I travel from out of town and think wow I'd love chipotle they're consultant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think she caught food poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Five stars for the food,despite the employee making your food telling them a few,not a good feeling to have when getting food from a place like Chipotle where you have to interact so often ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He was simply trying to inform her that more customers needed corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fantastic,The best time to come to this chipotle is ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-They kept the food I ordered online,-They put a label over your food with the order name on it,I was taken aback by this because no other chipotle I've been to has done this,-Everything I ordered online including extra fajita veggies or rice was actually on my order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are at least 10-12 of us all waiting out here for our food that we placed ahead of time & the people who are coming in to order are getting their food faster,I seriously can't believe the kind of service that chipotle is giving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is always fresh,  They are quick and have been willing to add extra ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I said the food I ordered ,They made my food,a burrito bowl ,I ordered a taco,Stopped going to chipotle for these same,and a side of chips,The chips were half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SO GOOD this is literally THE BEST CHIPOTLE THEY GIVE U SO MUch shot in ur burritos in ur,bowls in whatever they hook u,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of the food is going down,it tastes like they put a block of salt onto the food,For meat wise you get very little,where you have order double meat just to get the portion size of one serving to compensate for it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food seems to be back on track as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 burritos ,Way overpriced ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like extra cheese,When I was asking for more cheese a month or two ago to who I believe was the manager a month or two (larger white,cheese can be costly,Hey I get it with the lack of cheese in the picture I'm posting because I can't ask for extra in the app ,Sometimes the actual quality is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice,chicken,salsa,sour cream,sour cream ALL tasted completely different,Something AWFUL has happened to Chipotle recently and it tastes NOTHING like it used to, ALL tasted completely different,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food ,Not to mention that the burrito looked as though whoever made it,The bag of chips looked like leftovers from someone else's meal (it was pretty much,It was supposed to have enough chips to serve two people,The salad had leaked through the bag,what you typically find to be delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mean its Chipotle so the food is fine,The lady was so rude she rushed me along and I was not happy how she just slopped my tacos together,There was about 6 pieces on chicken on the two outside tacos ,When I asked for sour cream she slopped it all over the side and did not even put any in the end taco,Then I asked for more cheese she sighed,when I asked for lettuce I stated extra,lettuce,I felt like I was ruining her life over lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Thank you chipotle for making some changes to your menu,I asked for a salad - was given a bowl instead,My wife ordered the chips with guac ,and the new cheese,I asked for the chorizo and other ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality is not consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But if for some reason you live equally far away from 2 chipotles,I ask for pico and they put the hot salsa on it,No steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and my burrito was FIRE  great,Best experience I've had at a chipotle in a really long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 the food is waay,And ppl cooking the food need on HAIRNETS, to damn salty or meat way to dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which I understand because I work in food,I love chipotle ,and go to the chipotle in Sherwood all the time ,I hope this store improves because I love going to chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so no food for me ,Keep in mind that this is a very expensive food,I ordered a carne asada bowl,I had to cancel the bowl as I had a tight,they gave me a steak quesadilla that was left in the maker for over 10 minutes,therefore it was hard and with no signs of cheese in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
consistently very little lettuce in salads,wanted to charge me a dollar for an extra hand full of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good service and food,I come to this chipotle regularly ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 stars for the food here,Other times they only put half spoon of everything into the bowl,I once met a girl who gave me less than 10 pieces of meat ,25 when I asked for more meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not a fan of the rice,Now I've only been having the chicken,I love the salsa ,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the burritos I got here were always identical,burritos the size of footballs (small,: rice,Then they introduced brown rice as well as white,And Chipotle prices can raise no complaints,black beans,the pinto beans have been vegan,Course I still prefer the black beans,salsa,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I always get the burrito bowl with chicken," Their corporate commitment is to provide customers with ""Food with Integrity"" visit their website at: http://www.chipotle",rice, The price is right,chicken ,black beans,guacamole ,steak,and cheese,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is that a piece of chicken in the mild salsa,i asked for fresh salsa ,thats a question i actually asked and the answer was yes as she scooped me up another big ole helping from the other side which seemed to be meat free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I come to this chipotle ,and I eat a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered (and paid) online ahead so I could run in and pick up my food,Everyone there when I showed up plus many more customers made it through the line and paid for their food before I could get mine,Their salad dressing containers are sadly not even half,full and I had to request the dressing with my salad,they needed to replace half of the ingredients in the line,Ingredients were fine - I think the Sofrito tastes just like chili,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We had two burritos that were ruined with the old, My burrito bowl was ice, We received guacamole (large with chips) that was brown all the way through, guacamole, This used to be one of my favorite go to spots for a quick bite but sadly the quality has been declining,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have worked in food service for the past,So every time I am ordering food now I try to be as courteous,I've gone to this chipotle 3 times out of convenience ,I will not be going to this chipotle again ,and I would suggest you save your time and money and just go to the chipotle in between midway ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the beans and rice didn't match the proteins we got on them,We did an online order last night for 4 bowls ,and they managed to mess up basically everything in our bowls,All the bowls had sour,cream and cheese and 2 out of 4 of the bowls were supposed to be dairy,They wanted us to go all the way back so they can remake the bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the chicken was so DANG SALTY ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cheese tasted gross and the steak wasn't even edible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but this place gives very small portions of food compared to other,"Their ""double chicken"" looks like a single",serving of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So me (hungry) was wanting a nice and fresh burrito bowl,Makayla ur over) The burrito bowl was okay,they forget my chips,I POLITELY showed them my receipt and asked them to give me the chips,""" Like sis if you don't lose the brattiness and just hand over my chips",00 tortilla chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came here to pick up online order and the security guard apparently was only saying stuff to black customers about if they were the right person to pick up food what a bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Order 2 bowls today ,and the guacamole is soooooo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm doing Keto right now so I usually get a bowl with no rice/beans ,and double meat,They truly give me double meat,Other Chipotles (I'm looking at you Tualatin) give me about a scoop and a half when I ask for double meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
inconsistent food,Worst chipotle on the planet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First they forgot the rice for my son's meal,Then they did not have any lemons for their mediocre guacamole,the guacamole was brown ( I asked for fresh,guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle Mexican Grill wasn't the best,but when I mixed my bowl ,I ordered it online and my guacamole was brown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered online and it was very complicated I had to call to make sure it went through then I went to pick up and they got both my orders wrong they missed two ingredients in both bowls and the meat wasn't hot the rice taste old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not my choice) The food never came, The food was still sitting in the restaurant at 12:30,I was charged the delivery charge and the food was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
brown rice,I did a mobile order and got a salad with chicken,black beans,medium salsa Verde,sour cream and cheese,The honey vinegarette is the tastiest addition to this salad,I can't even compare it to anything else I've ever tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I come to this location sometimes and whenever I do the food is actually really good,and usually I get good service from most of the people there but the only thing that kept me from putting the fifth star is that the last few times I went to this location there were two very young girls working the counter where all the toppings are (the girls looked to be about 15 or 16) and each time they took my order the last few times I was there they'd give me weird/dirty looks as I'd be telling them what I wanted on my burrito ,and then one of them gave me attitude and rolled her eyes at me last time I was there when I asked for my burrito to be double,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got food poisoning on 04/16/2018,Horrible sickness from this food,Ate a burrito with chicken ,This was my first and last time to ever eat chipotle,pintos and a chips y queso,and steak,shredded cheese,sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do a lot of pickups here for DoorDash and Postmates and the food is always ready,I usually get a pulled pork burrito or maybe a chicken bowl,It tastes the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Just ordered via doordash once again (yes 4th time) and the tacos were completely wrong (even wrong meat choice and the sticker on the outside of the aluminum cover had the right order) and the burrito was garbage (looked like a miniature cheese,Kids cheese quesadillas were right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food ,I like getting their chicken burrito with guacamole,Chips and guacamole on the side is always nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered tacos on corn ,Not sure why I wasted the extra money on chipotle, #cornmeanscor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito ended up very soggy,The preparer scooped up black beans that had more liquid,than beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Wouldn't put rice on a quesadilla then charged $2 for tiny,plastic cup of rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I waited an hour and a half and three drivers gave up before they bothered to prepare the food,If chipotle is not going to care about Uber Eats deliveries they should stop offering the service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cashier is having to not charge the customer for food,especially pico de gallo and guacamole,and they find out midway that there isn't anymore pico de gallo or guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I return home after purchasing my food,I went to the southpark meadow location here in austin texas and order a veggie bowl with white rice red,and black beans amongst other items in the bowl,3 to 5 minutes later I open my bowl ,looked forward to my vegetable bowl ,I notice that my beans were hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If I wasn't in a rush I would've requested a refund immediately and left the food,this chipotle didn't have change available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am a big chipotle fan-,I eat chipotle about 4 times a week ,and this is hands down the crappiest chipotle in the country,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered two burrito bowls on the app,and tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I typically order a tortilla on the side and get a normal burrito sized tortilla,here they gave me a taco sized tortilla,The rice was so hard,I always order the same thing at any Chipotle and my bowl was literally half the size compared to every Chipotle in Orl,The guy behind me ordered a salad and they gave him the same amount of lettuce they would put on top of your bowl at the end of the line,The corn was still frozen it made my whole bowl cold,He told the girl he would need more and she looked at him so confused like it was a totally acceptable amount of lettuce,They tried to do everything to cut corners,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Usually they forget to put any meat or one time they just put beans and rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the guacamole looked brown,A couple of times they forgot to give me my dressing even though at the beginning of the order they will ask if I want dressing for my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
   :(  I'm so disappointed in the inconsistency of food quality,My rice had so much,I also ordered queso and a large bag of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you want a burrito,Overpriced,their only salsa option is Tabasco,the ingredients are always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle I've been too thus far ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I guess when the food isn't cooked ,causing me to get very sick with food poisoning (not to mention potentially getting everyone else eating there that day sick) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So we've been going to the chipotle on Lamar for chipotle,They were a little busy but not crazy or busy by chipotle st,Pushes bowl to register,My boyfriend only wanted mild and corn but they put every salsa on ,we got to cheese to ask for extra,cheese,Yes extra cheese,extra cheese,'Plops on tinyest amount of cheese ever' uhm could we get extra,So we're on a diet which means salad,salad ,and salad, salads ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I could literally see the bottom of the bowl with the severe lack of food they give you here,The only time I've eaten a Chipotle bowl ,I even ordered a double portion of steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband went two weeks ago to order us two beef bowls they gave us steak which was OK same price we told them no sour cream only a little on the side they put SO much sour cream which we could not eat when he got them home their attitudes were totally out of line with him we went ahead and my husband went back tonight and ordered a steak bowl for me this time they gave me beef again no sour cream on it only on the side again they smothered it in sour cream on it and gave us that side I call the manager and explain to him upfront I didn't want anything free I just wanted to bring it to his attention how rude his employees are especially to an elderly gentleman his response was it was all my husbands fault because he didn't pay attention I told him I just wouldn't come to his restaurant and he said fine and hung up on me this is totally out of line and very abusive to an elderly person  again which is sad because the food usually is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unfortunately I don't like is stale chips mixed,in among delicious fresh chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only to see customers go through the line quicker than my food is ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and typical Chipotle quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ordered online and went in and the the guy making the burrito practically used all old,ingredients that have been sitting there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came in at 8:30 and there was no white rice or guac or chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got the bowl , The chicken was okay, Then the items looked old and didn't taste good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered our food online which seemed convenient ,Picked up the food at 9 pm,Took the food home,We of course threw the food away ,His chicken burrito bowl was not cooked,RAW chicken served to us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today I craved that same burrito so I used the Chipotle Iphone App ,When I got my burrito I couldn't help ,Mike apologizing and explaining he had not charged my credit card for my burrito,I had the barbacoa and it was the best meat Ive ever put in my mouth,but notice is had no sour cream,I went back and checked the App and my order did say I wanted sour cream so I just called to let them know,Some kid picked up the phone said my order requested sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Decided to wait Bc this was the only option of food open,Came in today at 9:30 and they were out of chicken ,Btw 4 more people showed up behind us and get to have dinner Bc we stayed and made them make the chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Said it would be ready by 7:00pm Went to pick it up and was at the store at 7pm and we are still waiting for the food at 7:15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There were two female workers at the front making food,I came in and got a burrito to go the other,She finished up my burrito,I unraveled the burrito so my boyfriend ,and the burrito had completely fallen apart because it was not wrapped properly,I took the burrito back inside,and politely asked a different female worker (she had blond hair and braids) if I could have the burrito wrapped in another tortilla since it was ripped ,I told her that the burrito was ripped because the employee who made it did not wrap it properly,I can't re-wrap your burrito,I was really shocked at this point and took my inedible burrito ,as soon as he saw what Chipotle's solution was to my poorly wrapped burrito,and explained to him that we were simply just wanting our burrito re-wrapped,The manager was very apologetic and had the employee just make me a new burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was a piece of CHICKEN in my SOFRITAS bowl,I haven't eaten meat or dairy in over a YEAR quality control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lettuce could be fresher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Employees here are skimpy when it comes to meat ,and guacamole (even though you are paying extra,for guacamole),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They consistently give you the smallest possible serving sizes and when I requested more they legitimately put TWO extra pieces of chicken on the side,charge me extra and give me chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I guess its my fault for 'not checking' the food before I left the store ,I pre-ordered a bowl for pickup (it was ready,They clearly need guidance to figure out that beans means the customer wants beans,I get back to work to find out that 3 ingredients I asked for are just flat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle,I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hot food,Best chipotle in tow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I drove to the restaurant hoping that they would honor the free guacamole with my order made in person,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What's with the uncooked rice,The only thing I want crunchy at Chipotle are the chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Look every time I'm in there I ask for a salad,What comes with a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I love chipotle ,I walked in and noticed that the lettuce in the salad bowl still had wet, Instead of getting more cleaned lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not sure if this is a management issue or not but this has now happened to me numerous times despite avoiding several of the staff there who chince out -  I order half and half meat ,I used to go to the one downtown at least once a week and they give almost twice as much meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and ordering a burrito for pickup will take you 15 minutes of waiting or more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One burrito was half the size of the other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm a creature of habit so I usually just stick with a chicken burrito,"I was feeling ""adventurous"" this particular day and ordered tacos",I swear the woman serving me scooped up as little as possible and plopped it on my tacos,So I took my tacos ,bowl,if I was petty enough I could have counted each piece of chicken she put on it,I was honestly in such a bad mood I didn't even bother to say anything the last thing I wanted to do was argue over chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What is the point of online ordering if you have to wait for 10 minutes once you arrive OR when you get home and they leave out half the ingredients from your burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,but the employees barely serve any food for to go or inside orders,Most Chipotle's serve you enough food to feed 2 people ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came in with the family and the food was good,I'm talking food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good, And the only non-chunky salsa is an insanely hot,salsa that only adds heat,quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Did give us a lot of food,but food was bland,Not what I want when I think of chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We ate there on Saturday 5/19/2018 and my wife and I both got food poisoning,  We know it was chipotle because our kids only ate cheese quesadillas and they didn't get sick (they ate all the same foods we consumed other, Sure I wish they'd learn what a little oven could do to make their bowls and burritos, than at chipotle),Other than that I've always liked chipotle,its decently priced ,and usually tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Employee who was running cash register seemed very impatient and rude because when asked for a receipt instead of verbally answering she pointed sharply at receipt on tray under food ,I ordered a steak burrito along with chips ,One of the employees mixed chips into one chip bag ,and the chips were stale,The steak was tough,It was probably the worst steak I've ever eaten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got the Steak burrito with,the burritos are MASSIVE,Halfway into eating my kid-sized burrito,white rice,the rice was severely undercooked,pinto beans,steak was overcooked,cheese,they forgot the cheese,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and they prepare your food with a smile,I usually order a kids meal for my son and a burrito bowl,taste great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but we wondered if the overall size even cut down slightly on the number of serving stations they had as they seemed to be missing a salsa or two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We did a mobile order so we could grab our food ,I have contact chipotle customer service with information in regards to the visit,When we got home we were disappointed to find out there was zero guacamole in our bowl,Even on the order sheet it showed we ordered guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$70 for 4 meals plus a kids meal is not cheap so I would hope the food would be prepared properly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just got food,And she just dumped the food in ,38 dollars later and I basically wanted to throw my food away,The burritos were cold,I have never seen someone wrap and unwrap a burrito 4 times because they kept breaking the tortilla,so I told her to do what she wanted and she just re wrapped the sloppiness of what was a burrito,I wasnt asked if I wanted anything in the quesadilla besides cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is by far the worsssssssttttttttttttttt chipotle in town they need to close this location or fire everyone embarrassing to go service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had the burrito bowl with steak,The steak definitely has work to do because it wasn't flavorful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
making everyone's food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Chipotle seems to give you more food than the one in Harvard Square, I ordered my lunch from Chipotle on Sunday and the food portion was huge, The rest are all high bar stools and I want to be comfy when I eat my Mexican food,my fiance even said the burrito was enormous,although I could swear the chips they gave me were salted waaay too much,I wish this Chipotle had more regular tables and not stale chips ,Their guacamole isn't too exciting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fine,I recently went on a plant base diet and have been going to chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just wish they knew how to roll a burrito,I always end up with a blob of a burrito that always falls apart,Taco Bell rolls better burritos than this place,It taste the same no matter what chipotle you go to which is good,No carne asada so if you're going for steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my burritos come out just larger than the size of a softball,expect your burrito to be identical,I asked for salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice,I enjoyed the veggy salad bowl with beans,toms and salsa,Fresh ingredients is a plus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband confronted the cook about it after finding a hair in our food over a year ago,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food all over floor ,The dirtiest chipotle I have ever been in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was flat,The food just tasted nasty,Got through half the burrito before I tossed ,I wish Covid was to blame but I have been going to this chipotle for 3 years now,very disappointing and sad excuse for a chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The line seems to move at a modest speed and the food is typical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whoever they hire to deliver their ""food"" dumped a bag of their ""burritos"" that I did not order (I have never eaten ",I'm not fond of food poisoning) on my porch ,The manager claimed the food I did NOT order is now MY problem because it's on my porch (fortunately,Stay away from this store (and Chipotle in general -- don't forget its food sickened more than 1,so if it's employees can't handle standard food safety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was made okay,The line was so long because they were taking too long to make everyone's orders yet the burrito/bowl person kept sending them down the line,Went into this chipotle location last,I then asked for a side of salsa,Then he moved on to the next order and forgot to make the sour cream and salsa to go,side of guacamole,They took so long just to put the guacamole in the cup ,side of sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An $8 burrito became an $11 burrito by the time I was finished adding any flavor to my food,A single fast food burrito cost more money than a full,The only up side is that you can dissect it to make two burritos at home,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had not stopped by for a while and when I decide to give it another chance I get my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I found a roach in my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I only just started to visit Chipotle locations and have been pleasantly surprised at the quality and freshness of the food,food fresh,Certainly a food fast cafeteria type place ,The bowls with rice,the wraps also good but I prefer the bowl/salad,beans,salsa ,chips are great,ditto for some of their ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
today -a Friday- at 5:30pm they had no white rice for another 45 min,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were also receiving a delivery and had boxes and boxes of food stacked outside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheaper Mexican food from one of the numerous,I can see how someone living in a city that isn't in Texas might want to eat  a burrito from Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle I really do ,I ordered a bowl and they are out of brown rice ,Horrible not to mention I had to pay for steak price which is higher ,They were out of chicken ,I asked if they would make more chicken ,I don't understand you have a line full of people all requesting chicken ,and corn ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was at this location last Wednesday and ordered the carnitas bowl and later that night came down with a nasty case of food poisoning,I usually never get the meat here ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And usually one of the people on the food line doubles as the cashier,The food here is bl,ander than other chipotles,Ask for rice,Today I got no more than 4 Tablespoons of chicken,Today I only got chicken in every 5th or 6th bite,They also gave me about 3 tablespoons of beans because the container was running low,The meat portions are upsetting,Ask for more meat ,I asked for guacamole ,and the girl being trained gave me about a quarter of the regular amount of guacamole,they give you about a cup of lettuce,Order a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
long and curly and there is a high chance that hair can fall in the food while serving,I usually love the rice bowl,except for today when my husband's pinto beans were raw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is it unreasonable to ask Chipotle to offer a kids burrito size ,  Kids don't need a mammoth burrito,and price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My family loves the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can watch as they just throw food in a bowl,fast food including veggies and beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually go to N Lamar for chipotle cause it's on my way to work ,whoever wants to eat chipotle I recommend you to go anywhere else,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband and I ordered a burrito with carne,This was the WORST burrito I've ever had from Chipotle,brown rice,The rice was so undercooked,Just fat and crunchy rice,cheese ,NO sour cream or cheese,and sour cream,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered 3 tacos,got one rice over stuffed taco ,Husband ordered 3 corn tortilla tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(Though half of them have their noses sticking out of their mask over EVERYONES food),The food quality is good,Today I waited 15 mins despite arriving 15 mins after my food should have been done,ordered food ,When they did bring up my food which had been completed sometime ago,they also had everyone else who'd been standing there even longer than myself's food,Obviously my food was cold,it is actually worse as I wait longer (often in a big group of people) and get lower quality food,Just bringing food up ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The last straw was the quality of food in today's order,We ordered a carnitas burrito,it showed up as a bowl (with a label on the lid that said burrito),Half of the guacamole on the steak bowl we ordered was a huge,the quality should be good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered online and food was not ready,And the chips are ALWAYS STAL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I guess the people who live in the immediate community and walk here to enjoy your food ,But on the bright side I tried Roxys Hawaiian Grill next door and their food is amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's not that hard to be a manager at chipotles ,Most reasonable people at this point would have just put steak in the bowl,Got a bowl with beans ,How about chicken,chorizo is 55 cents more than a standard meat option ,how about no meat at all (that was the only,how about steak,"Chipotle manager: ""steak is 50 cents more ",and steak is 1,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's simple decent food,I just went back again and ordered soft tacos ,and crisp taco's the initial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and MEAT in my burrito bowl,This is the WORST chipotle location I've ever had the displeasure of patronizing,This last time they forgot the rice,beans,I was delivered a bow of cold shredded cheese and soupy salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fresh food (so I am told),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I'm craving my people's food ,then gave us a discount that made her bowl free,but it really tastes like no other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
found a roach leg in my burrito bowl,If you are one of the busiest chipotles downtown because you are the ONLY chipotle downtown then please do not wait until something is empty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is my favorite place to get mexican food,whether it's a burrito or bowl everything is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered two fajita veggie burrito bowls for delivery,we literally received half the size of the bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wasn't expecting to get anything super fresh when I went in to get food around 8:30 ,I freaking love chipotle that's honestly the only,""" Never been to a chipotle where they've been so rude",but this kid legit scraped what he had left in the containers and made it into 2 bowls,Not to mention the guy ahead of me asked for guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I assumed it was because I'm a small girl and she assumed I wouldn't be able to finish my food,and the food 3,Staff here are quite stingy with amount of food they give you,This is definetly not the best location to get your chipotle fix,and this time I tried the brown rice,Both white and brown rice was good,He too ordered the chicken bowl,Her portion of the chicken bowl was drastically smaller than her friend/boyfriend,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never had any issues coming to this chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
More than that the hot tray with food compartments was filthy,half spoonful of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 food,quality control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food arrived ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight I ordered some chips and salsa with my order,no chips and salsa in the bag,we don't have chips tonight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My go to is the spicy chicken burrito bowl with black, beans,corn salsa ,Never been to a Chipotle where they just slap a dollop of guac or sour cream the way this location does,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and nobody should have to go through that just to get some food on their lunch break,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and leave before you can even pick up your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually use my chipotle app,This chipotle really has their stuff together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's completely dirty and the food is not fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(Not only this Chipotle but many chipotle need to learn how cook,You guys need to teach co-workers how to cook on rice ,and steak,not soft to eat and steak was grossed, steaks right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and they're out of meat,and there is meat left,but a double order of meat means really 1,1 order of meat (1 regular,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for Chicken and another meat was mixed,Horrible experience they had browned lettuce ,and I asked for new lettuce, into my salad too without me knowing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can count on knowing that the food is going to be good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He just handed me my bag of food with my receipt as if to almost say get the heck out of here,Another guy made up my bowl for me ,Did all the extra stuff I wanted including chips ,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Door Dash person apparently brought the rest of our food ,The food wasn't that great, anyway - ice cold tortillas and dry meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We had to come home and season our food so we could eat it,and neither did the rice,The beans (both the black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't eat at this chipotle :/ the chips are okay,the rice is undercooked,The chicken is super,the lettuce is barely there ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I picked out the OBVIOUSLY rotten lettuce and cilantro but I must've missed some because not long after I had the distinct stomachache of food poisoning,otherwise I don't think we'll get food here anymore,The rest of the food for the fam was ok,So this is the closest chipotle to me ,chipotle is my go to,I saw that there was no lettuce to be seen in my supposed lettuce bowl,I've seen their lettuce quality take a dip over the last,Then I realize there is some lettuce ,but they're not big on lettuce so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It would take real skill to mess up stuffing a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Next time time you make a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And then you get home and the bag tears and there is the most minimal chicken and cauliflower rice,the taste is awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food is rarely good,as there's always food in the sour,and the rice ,and beans are always undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not sure if the employee took my order is upset w something that day or she just likes throwing food away,she gave me soooooooo little food,the food is like a small,After ordering half chicken ,I even have to ask to add more beans in the end,plus guacamole,and half steak,Chipotle always proud themselves as having fresh ingredients everyday so by the end of the day they often get rid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And they also wanted me to pay for my food that they messed up again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The steak and chicken quality has gotten poor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes I just buy a side of rice ,I love the white rice with cilantro ,and beans to have with veggies I make at home, I have to tap the chips on the table to get the excess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is 3rd time I've had to throw my food away in the trash after 2 bites,Do they not Taste the foods before serving,I'm a fan of chipotle in general,Very inconsistent with the rice,My first issue here is whoever cooks the meats at this location is over salting by 100x compared to other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've had a few minor issues as far as my chicken bowl is concerned,I feel like I'm taking money out of the employees own pockets when trying to get my bowl with an adequate,However the complaints about the stale chips are true,I've only had chips at this location once,When they offered free chips ,I've had chips before at other,I used my free chips ,stale and terrible chips,that I threw away and used regular chips from the store,The Late July quinoa chips rocked compared to these horrible,you need to figure out what the problem is with your chips,(I agree they can get quite skimpy on the ingredients, amount of ingredients in it,I feel like I should offer the employees money just so they'll give me more ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To my surprise management accepted the blame and then even went even further to fix the problem by giving free food,) It is a cheese quesadilla and then a burrito is made out of it,Prepare to have the best burrito ,and my perspective of chipotle is extremely positive,Best chicken and rice served here in my opinion,Really consistent on making amazing chicken that is always more flavorful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle online orders tend to have less food in it then ,my college group did call-ahead order once and the burritos were so small,(That should not be possible with normal sized chipotle burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not happy with my experience I don't know what goes on in this chipotle ,but there has been a different employee every week which means poor workers always getting fired but just yesterday I went to get chipotle with my partner ,and the lady poured me very little rice ,and a whole bunch of lettuce what am I a rabbit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Next time I'll have the chicken,cheese and guacamole, I loaded on the sour cream,I ordered a carnitas salad with their famous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
forgetting to put meat on my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All the other chipotle's seems fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food assembly line is all messy ,barbacoa in the chicken,Specifically the seasoning on the peppers and on the chicken,They are almost always out of something major (like cheese or guac,or last night both cheese ,so there's always corn in the sour cream,the very corporate recipes taste a little,Somehow this location always tastes just a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I love chipotle and all but this one has served me these half burritos one too many,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Recommend a bowl with a tortilla if you want anything close to a burrito or else just expect it to be leaking ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Recommend a bowl with a tortilla if you want anything close to a burrito or else just expect it to be leaking ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you do find yourself at Chipotle don't make the mistake of getting a burrito get a bowl with a tortilla,side for a DIY burrito,Straight gas and the best part is you get twice as much gas for only half the price,That way you get more gas for a better price,On Halloween they had a bogo and i got two bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito should have just been considered a bowl with how many,On top of that they informed me that they ran out of the cheese in the container,"Claiming that they were ""out"" of the cheese because they didn't not want to open another bag of it to finish the night with",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I stopped by on a Saturday afternoon and it took 20 minutes to get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love chipotle and the service was super fast here but I found a hair in my burrito that was 100% not min,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 so as I ate a tepid bowl in the dirty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just walked out of the door with our food which took approximately 20 minutes to even get made,Which was the only working on the line barely even knew what foods were what,not to mention my bowl barely has rice ,and black-beans on it,My girlfriend literally just walked back in because our bag of chips has maybe 10 chips in the bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today I got a salad with grilled chicken ,and the chicken tasted old, and stringy and the lettuce was wilted,One of the things I used to love about Chipolte was how fresh everything tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's an extra drive but you will get your money's worth and the food is always portion correctly ,not less than 1/2 of a normal chipotle bowl,The chicken and rice everything was cold,If I'm paying $7 for a bowl I expect it to be a normal,Not sure if its bad training or bad management telling the employees to put 1/3 of a scoop of each ingredient,This location is always out of ingredients also which I don't understand,and tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How does one mix Guacamole on a taco ,Ordered 4 meals to go today and a large guacamole  All the orders had brown guacamole on it, They asked to have it without guacamole , I called to express my disappointment but Allie began misquoting all the conversations and gave me a science lesson in guacamole,We did try it and found the guacamole to have an acid,"I have ordered here numerous times and can attest I have never had ""brown"" guacamole",we ended up throwing it all out and ordered a pizza (cheaper and delicious),taste it is apparent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the second time my boyfriend and I have ordered pick up/delivery from this location and have received minimal amounts of food,and a laughable amount of salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fresh,We got great portions and loved every bite of our food,The person making my bowl was very friendly, She even pulled out a new guacamole for him as it is located by cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nothing was marked-could not identify which burritos were for which person,Made for a creepy CV-19 lunch as we appointed one person to investigate each burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And usually one of the people on the food line doubles as the cashier,The food here is bl,ander than other chipotles,Ask for rice,Today I got no more than 4 Tablespoons of chicken,I only got chicken in every 5th or 6th bite,They also gave me about 3 tablespoons of beans because the container was running low,The meat portions are upsetting,Ask for more meat ,I asked for guacamole ,and the girl being trained gave me about a quarter of the regular amount of guacamole,they give you about a cup of lettuce,Order a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered our food ahead of time ,and after I got home and pulled out our food I found this disgusting moldy,This is moldy food was put in the order ,I don't want to know what was in my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why do they always act like the food is coming out of their paycheck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is great,and are very generous with food,all the meat and food is natural,gave me the best burrito ever,also gave my family and I a FREE bag of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Soooo ummmm if u want half the portion sizes for the same price as a full,Like bruh I'm paying for a normal portion bowl ,VERY VERY STINGY with their ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
long line and they don't care customer and the food common,I F paid 12 and they put just May be 7spoons food ,Wow this is the worst chipotle I ever eat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wanted lettuce instead of rice- they sprinkled the top,1/2 bowl is full,Black beans are not cooked all the way,They forgot guacamole, with a tiny bit of lettuce only,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We took our food to go ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great service and food,They even worked through a long line quickly and smoothly without getting frustrated or compromising quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You really are the best burrito (salad) in the city,grab one or two tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Listen I think it's great you might want to give me a lot for the price but do not douse my food in salsa,I asked for pico and corn salsa on my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Besides customer service being frustrating the food isn't fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Multiple employees not wearing masks properly exposing their noses while cooking/serving food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like chipotle,I asked for a bowl with lettuce and she proceeded to scoop and put white rice in the bowl,I told her I did not want rice ,and she let out a sigh and threw the bowl away,She then fixed a bowl with lettuce ,I told him I'd like a half scoop of black and pinto beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 the food has always been hot,meaning they're working hard to shuffle customers through their food line, The fact you can (in order) get white or brown rice, I've only been to Chipotle one time when they had to refresh rice (takes 3 - 5 minutes), One ding - chips are overpriced , Did I mention price, That's my carne of choice but the plain pork or chicken does its service too,black beans or pinto,5 kinds of meat,grated cheese,sour cream,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and one of the times they were out of guacamole so I went to Panera to buy some avocado (such,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anyone can push buttons and scoop food,As far as the food goes,the chicken I got was 80% that nasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great portions (I always get extra rice ,Great price,Sofrittas Burrito bowl is my current,and extra beans,You got to try the corn salsa I just discovered it ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think I ate yesterday's leftover chicken that was kept in the refrigerator ,The chicken was really cold,but all of the chicken pieces were cold all the way through,I could tell wome of the other ingredients were warm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was the best chipotle I've ever been too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How does chipotle run out of tortillas,Went here 2 days ago - out of chips,Went back today - out of chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will never get food here again or order from doordash again,The delivery person said they would go back to chipotle ,It's been an hour and haven't heard anything from doordash or chipotle,(Who orders just white rice,steak ,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff is rude and can't do the simplest job of putting your food together without an attitude,Obviously two totally different types of food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FOOD: My experience here with the food is usually pretty good,tonight's experience -- one of the younger employees had his AirPods in while working the food line this evening,there was a huge mess of sour cream globbed onto the food counter,"While he was putting my burrito together I asked for ""regular",he smirked and remade my burrito,so I don't ever get it on my burritos,While Air Pod Kid was wrapping my burrito,I was reluctant to ask them to remake my burrito a THIRD,so now I'm stuck with a burrito I don't really want because it's a mess of old," steak"" (instead of the new carne asada) and then watched as he piled my tortilla high with chicken",you said chicken,I then told him I asked for steak ,I asked for regular steak,I hate sour cream,he pushed one end of the shell all up in this nasty mess of sour cream just sitting on the counter,was covered in sour cream), ingredients I don't enjoy,No complaints about the quality or taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight I got my order correct but the food portion is nothing like you would get as you walk in,The chips are bl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are other burrito restaurants around this chipotle,They shake pretty much all the meat off ,"When I ask for the meat they shook off they charge me like $4 for ""extra",""" meat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had to go to the hospital and the doctors told me I had food poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for brown rice,I got white rice,I asked for no beans,I get a whole slop of beans,I asked for extra sour cream,I got NO sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had to wait 30 minutes past the promise time only to get cold food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my food into the paper bags,On 3 different occasions I've had the servers overfill my tacos with rice ,and lettuce making a mess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was meh at best ,chips are free and salsa is unlimited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always love the food here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Blows my mind that this restaurant would serve such terrible quality food,I called for a refund right away as we had to throw away all of our food because of the spoiled,This is ridiculous that I paid for all of this food that had to go in the trash ,burrito,I order from chipotle quiet,We had ordered guacamole on all of bowls,and gotten a side of chips ,"and guac (which they just wrote on the paper receipt ""sorry no chips""",The guacamole was completely rotten, guacamole,Still nothing no refund and they didn't even apologize for this and tried to justify that the guacamole was good,Anyone that tasted that could tell that guacamole was beyond rotten,taste ,Anyone that tasted that could tell that was beyond rotten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I did an order this evening and the guacamole I paid for was never put in nor was a couple of other,And it looks like they counted the salad strips because I got like maybe 15 strips of lettuce , ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered online and once the doordash person dropped off our food ,He then realized our bag was still sitting there at the store and instead of offering to make us fresh food he h,ands us the bag that had now been sitting there for an HOUR and gave us a refund of the food only,Once my husband and I returned home we opened our food to see that they made my husb,I will not be using doordash again and I am not happy with the way chipotle h,ands bowl wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can't make burrito bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9/10 times I'll get the tacos (hard,hot salsa,The steak is always great,and if they're not busy you almost always get double steak for free,I've had countless times where I've gotten 3-5x the amount of steak other,with steak,a little bit out sour cream (they're always too heavy handed with this and if there's too much it drowns out the steak/everything else,) cheese,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle I've ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today I ordered through the chipotle app,they told me to call and specify that I want plain white rice due,I talked to Alex (Alejandro) and he verified that they would put plain white rice,However when my order arrived they had put the white rice with cilantro still,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Either rice,beans,or guacamole on the different,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If I wanted a stale burrito shell filled with rice ,COVID is no excuse for shorting people on ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they asked me my order before I got to the window and my food was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's sad that this chipotle has been sl,It's the worst chipotle I have ever came across ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The customer service is non existent and the same girl serving my food was parked next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the burrito was very small,The taco box was placed *upside down* in the bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  And after I got home I discovered most of the meat was fat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It wasn't until I got back to work when I discovered that they forgot my guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pick out the bag with your name on it and they will hand the food to you through the door,Today I picked up an order of chips (complimentary) ,Although the chips were a little,Picked up an order last night and the side of guacamole that I ordered ,and guacamole with an additional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was in a rush and my food was sitting there for minutes getting cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While eating a burrito bowl,My spouse bought chipotle for the family today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
normally get the burrito ,and salad bowel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered extra chicken on an order,and i only got about 5-6 pieces of chicken in total,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""forgot ""to give me my chips ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was sour cream was all spilled because the threw everything in the bad along with the guacamole  was black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a chicken burrito bowl,rice,Just a bowl with chicken,I realized the chicken was the culprit,I ended up picking out the chicken the best I could,and a few salsas,I had to add my own sour cream and guacamole to mellow it out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have kind employees and fast service but even then it takes a while to get something with the crazy lines that are virtually always there so I recommend order online then just go pick it up so you don't wait 20 minutes for a burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited an hour for a bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
etc and landing on the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the meat etc, the guacamole on the side was also brown,I asked for extra romaine lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The guy was also wiping his face as he's serving food,I got a bowl with rice,the bowl was only half,chicken,I got no beans,and extra guacamole ,sour cream,no lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But once food came it wasn't our order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never had a more perfect burrito anywhere else than at Chipotle,The Romano cheese blends PERFECTLY with the sour cream and beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food took 20 min,Then salad wasn't available,had to wait for a substitute poor service they could have 86 the salad online ,and solve the problem I would not have ordered if no salad availabl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love chipotle,but because of how i was treated here i will never visit a chipotle ever again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Like the food , Like the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inside it's just wall to wall with employees so slow and bad at assembling burritos you have to wonder if it's vindictive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEVER go to this chipotle,So come here is you want to get shorted or just go to any other chipotle - these guys suck,So I went and bought a scale and weighed out his portion of chicken: 3,"They are ""meat Nazis",""" Every day I asked this doofy kid to give me enough meat (they promise 4oz)",insisting that I pay for double meat instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location charges bogus prices not listed on their menu,and where I could see the price on their menu for this item,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This time they forgot the bag of chips ,and the lettuce for a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the burrito that wouldn't feed a cat,When I got home I had to make more meat of my own,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please pray to god you don't have the female manager making your food,I've worked in the restaurant industry for multiple year and have visited this chipotle two time a week for over a  year now ,Barely cooked rice ,under cooked meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My bf just went and got a vegetarian bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is subpar,If you're in the area I would choose any other restaurant besides this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was like they were all in their own world back behind the counter & having to go out of their way to fix our food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got food poisoning on March 6 ,Either food was not fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But give me my money's worth of food,The staff here CONSISTENTLY underserves the meat,I understand it's an expensive ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And a little sour cream (grammy doesn't count calories on Mondays),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time we buy bowl in any chipotle they not put enough meat on the bowl only,rice ,99 to eat rice ,Worst protein serve ever no meet at all only rice ,and beans so we pay $7,99 to eat and beans ,Worst protein serve ever no meet at all only and beans again tired off that shi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- They never seem to strain the beans enough so it soaks into my burrito ,- How are there ALWAYS crushed chips all over the floors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the catbirds bowl ,and shared some chips with a gal,but the guacamole was nothing special,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place is by far the best to get food to go in walking distance to Emory,The only problem I've ever had at this location is that it is often overrun by pesky (and sometimes drunk) undergrads in search of real food,I'm just trying to eat a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dont know how a chipotle with 8 people working can be so slow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always 50 lbs of rice in my burrito ,Saving them up for some kinda special magician burrito,I asked for light rice this time,It's all rice ,My wife ordered a bowl ,and like 3 beans,and maybe 4 beans,and got no beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Weak ass rice ,and fatty chicken all the time,Rice is always soggy without flavor and you need to finger eat the chicken to get the fat off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food had a uniform,run of the mill industrial food service taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Not my fav place to eat but they seem to think the food tastes good, They do give you enough food that it's filling, Prices are reasonable,50 except for the steak bowl for Hubby at $7, I couldn't finish my chicken bowl,like a salad bar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love my barbacoa burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted below average of other,Seemed like the girl making my bowl just had her dog ran over,Other locations actually fill up my bowl with the appropriate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awful service and their food is skimpy,Great burrito's,Best chipotle ive,Norwood chipotle rocks though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I was told ""we just opened so we couldn't have made your food until now",This is the closest Chipotle to my work and I do enjoy the food ,ability to manage routine procedures that makes me really understand how Chipotle Norovirus and other food outbreaks occur in Boston so prevalently,upon arriving to pick my burrito up,proceed to make 2 burritos before mine,""" When I asked if maybe they could have made it before two other burritos which hadn't been ordered in advance so I could avoid the line",""" When I also asked if maybe they could have used some of the time they spent making the two employee burritos to make the one I ordered I think they started to underst",and how much they sucked at yet another burrito,Tastes similar to other chipotle's ,White rice or chicken or both,The rice is made in like,but they are consistently out of key ingredients like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is good,I got a coupon for a free burrito in the mail yesterday,I'm guessing everyone in my zip code got a coupon for a free burrito,but it lacks all the options you can get at a local burrito place,by stuffing that burrito to its limits,2 choices of beans,1 type of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it still ended up being enough food to fill me up,The server was a bit stingy with the rice,I was in the area for work so I stopped by Chipotle for my staple: vegetarian fajita bowl with guacamole (it's vegan,beans ,"Do I need to wear a sign that says: ""you do not need to save room for meat",cheese,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I had a grilled chicken burrito with rice,black beans,cheese,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the veggie burrito with the cilantro rice (this stuff should be illegal, The staff seem really friendly and they always seem to overstuff my husband's burrito,black beans,corn salsa,the salsa has more of a kick than other,guacamole (I love that there's no extra,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I was about to pay for my food (which I was really excited for),I couldn't even eat my food afterward,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They have no catering orders and they began the ""investigation"" into where my food might possibly be",""" (It's important to note that I saw David pick up his food",I'm not sure how I could get confused with ordering online dinner for David vs calling in a food order for 20,attempting to pick up food at the right,Mind you this whole time I was told my food was not ready,I was on an extremely tight deadline to get food for my team building activity ,and was about to call a pizza joint up the street to just get food made ,relying on food ,He somehow had the order/request in the back as my food was made per the original,somehow the food order came together really quick,My confusion lies in the fact that I've seen people get free food ,Something that chipotle has NO control over,Ignoring my fears of undercooked chicken ,"""I'm not sure what happened because I see that your order was placed for 2-meat spread on the 23rd",and raw steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one of the burritos,I somehow missed it during the burrito building process)  Today, He comped my companions burrito ,contained the wrong meat (I should have noticed,Yummy deliciousness - as I find at most Chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the slowest and stingiest chipotle I have ever been to, Double meat is more like regular,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything is always fresh and tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My girlfriend and I eat chipotle 4-5,so while we were here in Orlando(we come around once per month) we figured we would try a new chipotle spot,my chips were extremely stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited 5 minutes after my food was ready,My food was room temp by the time she finished the mix,a burrito bowl,my hubby ordered a burrito,and we had chips ,The chips ,the chips were pretty stale,and guacamole,the guacamole was delicious,but I'm not certain because I couldn't stomach how intense the taste of the mix was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Sometimes my burrito is flavorful,So I ate a little over half of today's burrito , The rice was off ,and had no seasoning and the chicken was very lacking in seasoning as well, and delicious ,and threw the rest away because it tasted so bland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is good,and they certainly have underwent a lot of food safety training since the exposure from the food borne illness sc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but sometimes I have gotten meat that was a bit dried out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,and I never have to worry about them fondling my burrito with meaty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Such a great value and the mini tacos and burritos were such a hit,We recently got chipotle catering for a party we had with about 20 people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drove to chipotle to get food because it was all I could think about,ate part of my burrito bowl,my usual is a massive burrito bowl,.burrito bowl that last,steak burrito bowl,chipotle is my happy,chipotle is a great,"

I stared at the burrito man when we started to build my food ,and told him more more more more more and by the end of it all I had was a tortilla with rice in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you go during the day at lunch they have fast service they put together good burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I always enjoy chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a salad with chorizo,All the ingredients were fresh, and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very personable and my food was amazing as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Now if only they started doing the mini burrito like that other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My wife and I both got burrito bowls and,I had the carnitas bowl ,and the wife had her favorite: steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I don't usually frequent chipotle with them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unfortunately my veggie burrito that was SUPPOSED TO HAVE white, rice,sour cream and Guac ENDED UP HAVING white rice,black beans,mild salsa,mild salsa ,Then my chips ,and 2 sides of guac ended up being chips ,cheese,no cheese,sour cream ,no sour cream , and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They always mess something up with their food ,I'm a huge fan of chipotle ,This one by far is consistently the worst chipotle I've ever been to,If you are a chipotle fan you will know what I mean, Even though I now live right near this chipotle I will drive to a different,For example either the chicken is too dry,chips are salty or stale and the salsa is always off as well,and it never tastes as good,Also their good never tastes,I have no idea why but it always tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are seemingly always out of brown rice,thank you for putting my bowl in upside, The first time we went they were out of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Weeknight line was so long and so slow I could have raised my own Hormone free chicken in that tim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it ruined my whole chipotle exlerience for life,I have been doing chipotle for 6 years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Slowest chipotle I've ever seen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are stingy with toppings and meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I loved the vegetarian burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My favorite is their burrito bowl (tortillas are overrated) with the cilantro rice ,and grilled chicken,they have delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After I told the cashier it was my birthday she asked the manager and his response to me was ""are you used to people giving you free burritos on your birthday",So I paid for my friends burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I love the burritos, I've gotten brown rice before in an attempt to be healthier, I love the chicken , The key for me is that I get the hot salsa , That way you get the hot salsa ,and then put sour cream and cheese in it,and the cool sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes my burrito bowl is amazing ,They can be pretty skimpy on their servings with too much salsa and meat and not enough rice or beans ,and the bowl itself only about half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chicken is somehow amazingly crispy on the outside,A veg or chicken dish will run about $7,and other meats cost about $7,It tastes like they grilled them over wood flame,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not the best chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would never go to this Chipotle again I have waited for my food for 20 min,n my girlfriends already had her food n is halfway done, When I got my food ,and i realized when I was eating my meat were raw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we watched employees pick up dirty utensils laying on the counter of spilled food ,and stick them into the rice bowl ,including white rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As much as I love the food I don't go as often as I used to because of the slow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle forgot my chips which is cool,for a measly portion of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Veggie bowl usually includes guacamole,but that doesn't mean they have all the ingredients until closing time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my carnitas bowl and the guy making it serves me my food ,I asked the guy if there is something wrong with it because I'm not understanding what the secret is and why laugh about serving food,My boyfriend ordered a burrito which we pay $7,For that I can go to Taco Bell and get the same size burrito for $2,I have been to many chipotles ,I go to many restaurants and what I can't seem to understand is how McDonalds and other fast food restaurants have baby changers inside their restaurants but chipotle doesn't,Seriously worst chipotle experience ever,On top of that every bite I had or my bowl was spicey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered 3 burrito bowls ,Second bowl I paid for double,The third bowl was double,I called the store and the girl on the phone was apologetic and offered to give me the 3 bowls I paid for next,The first I paid for double chicken , chicken ,and steak and just had regular portion chicken,and steak , steak ,and there was NO steak whatsoever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you know it'll be predictably-decent food in the $8-12,The staff is friendly and the food has never let me down (although,Lots of sodium and rice to keep you full,I always just get a basic veggie bowl),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The workers were using bleach at 7:30pm and the smell was over powering the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Need to work with their customer service and if a customer complains cause you are not doing your job correctly in a nice manner just deal with it and move on don't slam food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I am serious about what I like in my burrito bowls ans the workers are generally very polite,I seriously love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This particular location really skimps you on the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You get a decent amount of food for the money ,Probably not the greatest burrito you will ever eat or the most authentic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was the absolute worst experience I've ever had in my life in any food joint,when I finally get to my table with the food,the burrito I ordered had barely any rice,the main part of my burrito since I wanted very little, chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burritos still taste great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I bought my usual- a chicken burrito bowl,The rice was oily ,The guacamole was also oily (,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like your food,Or at least the salsa,Baja Fresh gives free chips and unlimited salsa while you wait for your order,the servers who always seem to give me only a spoon of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I basically eat here twice a week because of my laziness and my love for Mexican food,this chipotle has had the highest quality and quantity of food for its price,I get a burrito bowl with a tortilla on the side,I don't know how this chipotle doesn't have six stars,Out of all the chipotles I have been to in Atlanta ( the chipotles in Arizona are pretty good,with black beans and brown rice ,I always get a bowl because of the quantity,These bowls last,I waited ten extra minutes and was late for work so I could get some freshly cooked chicken the other,I get some chips ,I top her off with a glob of guacamole,cheese,sour cream ,and lettuce come next,corn,Whoever is working there is doing something right because every bite is so delicious ,and squeeze some lemons on top for a nice taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The portion sizes are out of control - NO ONE needs that much food in one meal,but I'd rather pay the same price and get a well balanced dish with half as much food,nor do I want my food slid,I watched someone try to fold up a burrito,the fresh avocados or salsa being made make my mouth water,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
something is always wrong with my burrito,It took me 20+ minutes to get through the line and when I got home the girl who got my burrito for me made it so sloppily it ripped in three separate,I hadn't eaten in chipotle in years because their service always sucks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had an unsweet tea while he ate a chicken bowl,The tea tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I still have a tough time thinking about eating food they prepared,I'm sure it doesn't affect the quality of the food,I like the burritos at Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is very bad,they can't seem to look at the ingredients right in front of them ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and my husband got hardly any chicken in his burrito bowl,tonight there were very few chips for them,Our kids meals are only half full of at least one ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They don't really put enough sour cream or toppings on the burrito,11 for guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tripping over each other and no elbow room to scoop food items,4 Stars for food,slowest meat scooper ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is OK,my chicken was undercooked today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 When it came to the food the bags of chip that we had gotten were both stale, Not good for a place that holds itself on high food st, and did not taste fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Watching this guy make a burrito is like watching paint dry,Then ordering a burrito,remembers what he was doing and puts it on my burrito,I must say) dude can't even roll the burrito well,guy puts tortilla in the heater and asks about rice,"""white rice","""You said brown rice",dude white rice,half chicken,"""You said chicken",beans ,black beans,"""What kind of beans"" black", Then after the final few details (guy put the perfect amount of hot salsa,and meat,half steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is THE worst location I have ever bought food from,First off their food tasted gross,My only complaint was about the food,I went to this location to try another chipotle location other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you wanna go to a nicely decorated taco bell with bland mediocre food where you can see the ingredients (crap) they put in your burrito before they wrap it then this is your mecca,no care in the food,crappy (bland americanized) salsa,no love in the melding of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wanted to order carnitas bowl ,I got my bowl,cup and a side of salsa without a tray,The worst part of the order was corn,I love corn in Chipotle: if normally tastes very fresh,with little bright green pieces of jalapeños and cilantro (don't judge me if my memory is failing and that's not what used to be in corn,This corn was -no,Just canned corn,I don't know if the entire Chipotle chain just decided to downgrade the quality of corn or it is just something unique,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not talking a dirty table I mean every single table is covered in food as well as the floor,The food prep,I usually love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited in line for at least 20 minutes to get my food,I paid for my food ,First with the rice,Got home and started to eat my bowl and the rice is not even close to being done,I mean crunchy and hard rice,and drive all he way home to find out we were completely missing a bowl,then she plumped a huge pile of lettuce on it ,and I told her no lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wouldn't order online because they give you very little food,I now have to go in and make sure to watch them make my bowl,they completely forgot the meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think real ingredients are great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Food tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typical chipotle fare,skimped on the meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A veggie bowl with most of the selected items not present,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes they charge me for guac in my burrito ,when I've been told before that guac is an included option in a veggie burrito by a manager,Sometimes they charge me for 3 sides of guac because they include the guac in the burrito,Sometimes they just charge me for 1 side of guac because they give me less guac in my burrito,It's burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh,a hot lunch from Chipolte is much better than food court nonsense,My favorite part of any Chipolte experience is the chips-- they put lime in with the sea salt ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is a great ""fast-food"" option", This food is not going to remind you of that little,but it's fresh Mexican food on the fly,I feel like I've gone down the gauntlet at some weirdo food military, hole in the wall place in a back ally where you got tacos ,Nice fresh ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was a little disappointed that my chicken soft tacos came in a flour,I had them load up the tacos with fresh,tortilla but the chicken itself was crispy , tomato salsa,spicy tomatillo-red chili salsa,cheese ,sour cream,and lettuce,(And this'll sound a bit crazy but I was struck by how green the lettuce was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle always skimps on the portions it's ridiculous,I have been to a lot of branches and this one definitely has a quality control problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food orders just pile up,like the brown rice,the meat (grilled chicken),The other ingredients are always out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was so on point,and gave me my mountain of corn which is the best thing about chipotle (in my humble,Let me end with this-the best thing about chipotle is that it's so big,mild salsa,spicy salsa ,I don't love cheese ,and sour cream (don't hate me yelp fam) ,I got lettuce,and of course their corn,but I don't think it adds any taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is one of those food stores that never loses its taste nor style,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What I got was cold bird food,Our burritos were cold, They gave me a coupon for 1 burrito, and full of rice w maybe 2 oz of meat,of meat  I don't think so,Did I mention at 8 pm on a Sunday night their was only steak available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The link cooks were busy but didn't miss a beat making my steak burrito big,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The time before that the rice tasted like they dumped a pound of salt into the batc,4th time in a row they haven't had guacamole 90 minutes before closing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My experience today was a disgrace to ""queso and chips"" save your $5",The powder cheese crap was not only bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice tasted like metal ,and the chicken felt ,It tasted,and tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,with free chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didn't like that when people order and your in the food industry like I have you listen ,Other than that food was good,Some of the people don't know the menu I ask for a side of rice which is like a cup ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I am always satisfied with the quality of the food,Chipotle is the best burrito around,The prices are reasonable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cilantro in the rice gives freshness , A spiciness to the chicken,and the salsa's are simple, Chipotle utilizes fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
every time I eat bad Mexican food I then crave Chipotle,I indulge in the burrito bowl which if you think about it is less calories than a tortilla,They disclosed there is a secret burrito that can only be ordered if you know of it,there are calories in the bowl as well ,but just in what you put in that bowl,I put the lean meat such as chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,This is my favorite chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
watch out for one of the employees with shoulder length brown hair-- she skimps on food a bit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got the bowl and the worker didn't put a lot of rice so I had to ask for some more,Why skimp on the rice,So now I partake in the chorizo bowl ,"I was busy paying attention to the ""orange"" interaction and didn't realize the worker barely put any chorizo in my bowl",I didn't bother getting chips ,Shoulda settled for the steak,The chorizo tasted gross,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am not usually a fan of the corporate franchise food scene ,I am a snob when it comes to style however and when I see them rolling my burrito it is always a let down,Call me old school but I expect my burrito to look like an elongated,and return my burritos to their original,use a little less rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is decent, The food at this location was decent,--I was pleased with the steak burritos we offered, The prices aren't bad, I will give them a high five for generously serving real pieces of meat as opposed to gristle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didn't realize till I got home my food was cold,When I say my food was cold,My beans and rice were not hot,Since it was just after 11am my guess is they had left over meat from last,For a company that prides itself on fresh  ingredients left overs from the night before are not fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and good prices,Freshly cooked meat ,and other ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dropped in on a random Saturday morning before watching college football for a burrito at home,I usually get a steak burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location seems clean but the burrito was weak,I've had better burritos at Olecito (cheaper) ,and Oggi (in the same price range),All I can remember was a bland cilantro-lime rice,cold shredded cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the quality of the food is much lower than other,Drive an extra few miles to Lamar for a better burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everyone knows what the food is about at a chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love chipotle,friendly staff that greet you and there corn salsa is the bes,they have the new grilled tofu I don't remember what they call it but taste like beef ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location give very small amounts of food on your order ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only downside is that the food (like at all Chipotles) is so high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I opted for a burrito bowl,Choice of rice,Nicely loaded with chicken ,choice of beans,choice of salsas then add sour,and guacamole , cream and cheese ,and guac and lettuce,Topped with lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have always loved chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so if the food is pretty,They lost two stars for cleanliness in the dining area and because the girl couldn't make the burrito without breaking the tortilla,Not a huge fan of double wrapping or having a hold in my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Still trying to find a way to purchase a week's worth of chicken and lime rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let me say I love most Chipotle's and burritos in general,All three I dealt with made a mistake on a single burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We had chicken burrito bowl ,and chicken with chorizo burrito,On top of that i barely saw meats on my chicken burrito bowl,And the taste is so bl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took us around 30 minutes to order our food,After waiting so long to get my food the last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1 - the service: the employees take their sweet time getting to you when you're blatantly standing there ready to start your burrito or what have you,2 - the corn: basically every other,the corn salad is basically white,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only for Mexican food instead of s,the food cooking right behind the workers ,As was my boyfriend's carnitas burrito,Crunchy tacos,This time I had a salad with barbacoa (deliciously sauced shredded beef) and the corn salsa,like when you order a specialty sandwich that has ingredients ,and it was absolutely top notch delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have enjoyed numerous burritos,tacos ,Chipotle's meats are naturally raised without antibiotics ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Like barely can make it out the food court I have the runs,I felt a little rushed by the staff when ordering and paying for the food,but its a busy mall food court,Maybe it was realizing that I'm paying almost $20 for two burrito bowls,It just didn't taste right from the beginning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I saw the new Chorizo burrito advertised,I ordered the burrito bowl ,The service was great and the ingredients were fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The downside however is that you don't get to see them put your food together,same great food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the only one to never skimp out on ingredients for your bowls/burritos,The best chipotle that I have ever been to,The seasonings on the meat are the best I've tasted from any location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good quality Mexican food at an inexpensive,It's not as good as real authentic Mexican food,The food here is just like any other,But I usually just get burritos , price,and bowls,It's located right on the corner of Cornell Rd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food all over the counters,near where chicken,and had a lovely and delicious lunch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but if you get a vegetarian anything (salad/bowl/burrito) the guac should come for free,The guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also you tend to get more guac if you get it on the side instead of in bowl ,Get double everything except meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but this location gives you almost NO food,I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I received a salsa burrito,they filled my burrito with salsa, There was not enough steak available, Rather than waiting for the next round of steak to be finished cooking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is consistently delicious,Try the salad dressing ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is always really fresh, You get so much food in the bowl that you could save half of it for leftovers,I used to always get the hard tacos (you get three),but now my go-to meal is the rice bowl, My favorite ingredients for my bowl would be white rice,chicken or barbacoa,mild and medium salsa , The chips are really awesome,their guacamole is my absolute,as they are freshly made and have this lime salt on them which goes really good with the guacamole,and cheese, Everything is delicious so you can't go wrong, Speaking of delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today after Polish the Pearl Chipotle gave us free burritos,That's 80 free burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good Mexican food ,It is not the best tasting Mexican food , They do give you a lot of food at a reasonable, The burritos are also large,rice , price,I recommend getting the bowl with steak,and peppers and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So she gave me my bowl (with guacamole),my soda & bag of chips all for free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd say this one has the best food as far as seasoning ,the preparation of the food is definitely the best part,now I know you're all thinking they all use the same products or taste the same but if you're a foodie you can tell the difference,I'd suggest coming here for better tasting bowls burritos or whatever you'd prefer,Out of the chipotle locations I've visited in Atlanta,I choose quality over everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was pretty damn good,Is the food good,I wanted a burrito ,it is not a burrito,but no burrito,I was confused thinking that maybe I asked for the bowl thing in my struggle to figure out the on-line ordering so I double checked and I did infact order a burrito,am I bummed I didn't get the burrito I was promised,Now I am sad that I didn't get the burrito I had anticipated ,I believe I will go again on a day where everyone and there brother isn't in the mood for Mexican and hopefully then I'll get the burrito I desire,Well--before I begin I have to say that I decided to go to Chipotle for the first time on the one day of the year where it is acceptable to drink thirty margaritas and eat 70 tacos without judgement,kind of making a make shift taco salad,It came out to about $9 which is a little pricey ,Instead I got rice ,and cheese and lettuce and chicken,and some chips,I'm glad I got the chips because I crushed them up ,I go to the register and the girl there tells me to go to the other corner,and put it all over the mixture of deliciousness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your chance of them having guacamole is less than 50%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was lettuce and other food sitting all over the counter near the register too,As my burrito was being made I observed the counter where they prep it was littered with sour,As they wrapped my burrito I noticed a lot of sour,Oh and i ended up with corn salsa in my burrito somehow even though I didn't order it with it,corn and beans, cream and salsa on the outside of the tortilla,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My family and I finished our food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We order online and usually there's at least some issue with our food that we don't find until we get home,only 1 out of 3 tacos had fajita,no extra rice,and there was hardly any salsa on either of our meals,the steak was full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
poorly wrapped burritos,11 surcharge to add it to your bowl/burrito,68 kids taco kit looked interesting,my bowl was pretty big,adobo-marinated and grilled chicken or steak,78 for chicken or vegetarian)  - I ate till I was full,they told me so) or vegetarian black beans, I liked their chips - just thick enough to not break at the drop of a hat,rare in the center - perfect for my meat eater DC,The guacamole here is fine,25 for the steak or carnita options, Their grilled steak was cubed, Just a smidgen of sour cream on the side, The one on the corner of School St ,Salsa - traditional tomato or corn,and undercooked ingredients, You want a little more of one ingredient or another,but I'm not sure which ingredient was at fault for that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am a total chipotle fan ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chicken salad with honey-chipotle viniagrette makes me wish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had a white rice bowl,beans,sour cream and guacamole,He did give me the impression that he thought it might not have been in the guacamole,cheese,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food also tastes fresh which is a plus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so it was a little weird to feel like they were afraid to throw a bit of cheese on my food,It's not terrible and I still enjoyed my food,I asked her if I could have a little extra rice (she was VERY skimpy,so my bowl was very dry,There was little sour cream and cheese, and I never even tasted any cheese,but the portions of each ingredient are strange,"I almost have to tell them ""light"" on some ingredients",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a burrito bowl,tacos,I never got the quesadilla and received only one taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I grabbed a burrito here for lunch with carnitas,it comes with rice,the chicken would have been a better idea,tomato and spicy salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had the shredded tofu on this trip and its delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Chipotle's food,We have had staff forgetting to add all the order items and it is usually too crowded to go back and request them to add some salsa they forgot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was cold ,and they were out of beans,How does a Chipotle run out of beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always good,and I always get a good amount of food for my money,I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seems inconsistent on the quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Friendly staff and clean establishment but they always skimp on the rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I know Mexican food probably can't get any better than what you can find in Texas, You can choose to have a burrito,burrito bowl, I ordered the burrito bowl with chicken,taco,brown rice,the brown rice was seasoned perfectly , I ordered the  with chicken, The chicken was excellent,pinto beans ,the  was seasoned perfectly and the salsa was tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice was undercooked,I went back up to the cashier and told her that the rice was undercooked,grabbed me a sample cup of freshly made rice ,and let me try it to see if I wanted a new bowl with the new rice,The rice was fully cooked this time,I ordered my regular chicken bowl,I was wondering why my bowl didn't taste as good,She had me fill out a order form and brought me back a new bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burritos) it's always pure,That was a waste of a $10 overpriced chicken salad,I've ordered chicken on my bowls before at various,bowls,it's freakin chicken breast for God's sake,Everywhere else I go that offers chicken on anything (salads, white chicken breast,"This was the experience that finally made me say ""no more meat from Chipotle""",I kept going back hoping that maybe this time someone trimmed the meat,the steak has the same,Well last night I got a salad at this location ,"Next time i'll get one of the ""prepared salads"" in the produce section of Safeway a block away for $5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Their food is consistant, This location made the best burrito yet, They just happened to mix the right amount of each ingredient ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went in and got the most stingy version of tacos I could come up with,I took 3 bites of empty taco shell before I got any sort of filling,So I basically ended up with a taco of salsa,I'll stick to other Boston Chipotle locations where they understand value or at the very least don't give me one taco for the price of three,Literally there were 5 little chunks of meat in them,Best part of the meal was the guacamole (that I paid an extra,On top of that they even skimped on the lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was hot,they have never been out of chips like my closer location always seems to do, and fresh and they did not skip on the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Addicting and delicious stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have allergy of meat ,but I have seen meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is always great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but yet an Employee was able to jump in line and get food for themselves immediately,Don't get me wrong food was good,Music up so loud the line workers at each station had to ask me 2 times what I wanted on my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mildewy smell lingering that the food aroma can't cover,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their food is sustainably raised,I generally like to get burrito bowls,and then I ask for a tortilla on the side so that I can get my filler more evenly distributed than what happens in a normal burrito,But I've never had any problems with them giving me a little more rice if I ask for it,I would also recommend trying out their chips ,The chips have a hint of lime,and guacamole,(Getting a giant bite of only sour cream,and delicious (which,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't think I've ever had warm food here,or maybe its because I only want a burrito at 9 o'clock at night,My only qualm is how much extra they want for a spoonful of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I hate when I have a craving for chipotle,I'm good for awhile chipotle ,I went with the steak bowl and very little rice ,It wasn't terrible and I realize my bowl is very basic,I do not like fatty chunks of unchewable meat in my bowl ,lettuce red salsa tiny, Everything had tons of flavor but the meat was a bit rare,even for me and then the fact there were literal chunks of fat mixed in with the meat, bit of corn too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get brown rice,chicken,corn salsa,tomato salsa,You can substitute meat for guac,cheese,and a little sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my carnitas bowl and the guy making it serves me my food ,I asked the guy if there is something wrong with it because I'm not understanding what the secret is and why laugh about serving food,My boyfriend ordered a burrito which we pay $7,For that I can go to Taco Bell and get the same size burrito for $2,I have been to many chipotles ,I go to many restaurants and what I can't seem to understand is how McDonalds and other fast food restaurants have baby changers inside their restaurants but chipotle doesn't,Seriously worst chipotle experience ever,On top of that every bite I had of my bowl was spicey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I opened our burrito bowls to find meager,One of the line cooks actually dipped a cup into the chicken , portions and brown guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the floor was riddled with food & trash & the trash was overflowing,food violations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most tasteless burrito I've had in a long,I could make a better burrito from the leftovers in my fridge,The barbacoa tasted like absolutely NOTHING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted fresh,"For a ""faster food"" type of experience",rice ,I had a steak bowl with beans,I also had their chips and salsa,and delicious and the salsa is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is cheap,The chips are good,The guacamole is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited 25 minutes and no food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I thought I could pop in and grab a bowl to go ,I was told I had to leave and they refused to serve me a bowl to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So we all know the food at Chipotle is relatively healthy,or even as complicated as 90% of the food choices out there,It's a burrito bar with a staff of employees who should be able to quickly build these basic food items ,the food is pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was delicious, Good ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can't compare to this burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FYI foodies,but we also look at the big picture and use other metrics for selecting our foods,the only food items we serve that could contain GMOs are our soft,burrito,soft flour tacos,crispy corn tacos,brown rice,Any customer looking to avoid GMOs entirely can eat a bowl,black beans,pinto beans,These include sourcing naturally raised meats, corn tortillas,or a salad without worry,I am going to share my email response I had with a Chipotle executive about their ingredients,Chipotle is the only fast food restaurant I eat at occassionaly because this company is committed to sustainable and organic--respect for animals and environment--good quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice was over done ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really hate paying full price for half portioned food,I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon after some retail therapy close by for two orders of tacos to go,One taco set was crispy,When they realized that they had to go to the back to grab the crispy corn tacos,When they did grab the corn tacos,the staff literally put a teaspoon of each ingredient in each taco,it took a long time before my tacos were assembled ,How about a little more rice,can I get a little more beans, corn ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BUT when the staff is rushing your food along (like today) I don't feel its very good,the person in front of me who was paying asked if they added Guac to there bowl ,and the staff couldn't remember (going to fast) so they had to re-open the bowl to make sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The last time I went I walked out without getting any food because of the following,- the air vent above the food line is covered in black, All of this is directly over where the food gets passed out from the grill/prep, One of them went from eating a burrito to the food line ,straight from eating her food to what was to become my food,she would pack food in bags,-an employee was holding a silver tray of lettuce in the food prep, She tossed the lettuce around in the tray and it was passed to the food line,All of my inner food safety alarms were sounding at this point,I suppose I still feel mistrustful after their food safety issues, I just couldn't get past these many major food safety violations I observed in only the time I was st,I love your food,the guy in front of me was getting a burrito, As the employee started rolling the burrito the customer had to get his attention to tell him there was a hair in the burrito, I looked down at his burrito ,and got herself some salsa, She called for another employees attention and picked up some pieces of the lettuce that look,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always enjoyed their steak burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Have been coming to this chipotle for a long,Every time I get the same order: white rice,pinto beans,cheese ,and sour cream,The ingredients are prepared, right there and are always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But instead of getting that I decided to join a co-worker who wanted to grab lunch at Chipotle as I saw another guy at work enjoying some corn tortilla chips from there,or their chips & guac,even though some chips had some lime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your burrito WILL fall apart,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is seasoned so good,I like to get the steak food bowl with rice black, beans lettuce sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I always order double steak and for some reason they give me less meat then I get when I go to a different chipotle would give me with regular,They seem to make a point of giving you about half as much meat as they're supposed to, steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First time here at this chipotle,Frequent other chipotles like Waterford ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food smells so fresh,I can SMELL the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We rediscovered Chipotle and didn't die of food poisoning,Their food has always been quite tasty,That said tasty beans,yummy meats ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vegetarian (fajita veggies) burrito,This burrito was huge,brown rice,For a while I was disillusioned because of price increases ,black beans,hot and corn salsas,"and satisfying and their ""hot"" salsa has just enough burn to trigger that ""I want more"" feeling",cheese ,sour cream,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always top,My mouth is watering just thinking about the steak burrito bowl with no rice or beans,and the delicious chips that I can't have because I'm currently overseas :'( I miss Chipotle more than anything,and the steak is a bit more spicy than usual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The woman that was scooping the food has terrible,The food server woman just looked like she hated working there,She was so impatient and was rushing my mom and I with choosing the ingredients for our burrito bowl,My rice was soaked ,We want spice on the certain bowl ,and she gave it to my mom's bowl,I didn't want pinto beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Black beans,steak and medium salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I got to the counter and said that I wanted a chicken burrito, I had the burrito ,my burrito was a leaky,and the wife had the bowl,My wife's bowl was good, The told me that they were out of chicken , The bottom looked like it was taking a dump of beans into my basket, I usually don't get guacamole due,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meat ,and cheese (no other, ingredient) put on aluminum foil ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The kitchen looks like a food fight just happened,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a burrito to go with half brown,The burrito was then wrapped so poorly that it fell apart before I had a chance to unwrap it (by peeling the foil off of one end while keeping the rest of it wrapped like you're supposed to),There are so many other good burrito places in the neighborhood though that if the consistency is slipping this much, rice ,and half white rice with steak & sofritas with a side of chips,The portions of rice ,I discovered that the rice was undercooked,I was haphazardly handed off to another employee to proceeded to be equally stingy with cheese and salsa,and half whitewith steak & sofritas with a side of chips,the chips were all stale,The portions ofand meat I received were stingy,the steak was overcooked,the service and quality have been quite sub-par,When I arrived at approximately 5:20PM there were only a few people in the place so I expected that the attentiveness and quality would have been better,so I know what the consistency and quality SHOULD be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I thoroughly enjoyed the crunchy undercooked rice(Not),On my visit today I got half a spoonful of protein in both my bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are tex-mex basically although the quality and the flavor is good while in America is a near-like mexican taste although guacamole is a little price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice was clumpy ,Ordered a simple chicken and black bean bowl, The bowl here already is 2,The guacamole was about empty,The cashier yelled rudely that she would have to charge me for an extra side of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Whether it be that they are out of rice,chicken,or steak,or old lettuce this place really knows how to piss off ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what they had was chicken ,and I have never had so much gristle in a serving of chicken in my life,I have known this location to always be a mess and consistently run out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I took my son here for dinner tonight and decided that I would have a burrito bowl,The employee was apparently new because she didn't put enough steak in the burrito bowl ,"and I asked her for more and they have chorizo now so asked for that as well and the other RUDE employee shouts down the line saying ""you have to pay for double meat"" I was not talking to her plus I knew There would be some kind of charge for that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't really have any complaints about the food or quality,I always get the same chicken bowl and I always have a sufficient amount of food,I go to this chipotle about 2-3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Chipotle is pretty consistent and I have yet to have any medical issues from this place so I'll continue to get my burrito bowl on,The barbacoa is still a big winner - a little bit of zip that complements the chicken quite well (all the cool,so lots of Orlandoans whizzing by you while you snack on your chips and salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but this Chipotle has had much worse tasting food lately, Just bring back the good food,the chicken has been old,the tortillas stale and the chips are flavorless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food sucked,the people were in such a rush to get your order done that they messed up my order and the food was such,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh my gosh chipotle,I love chipotle,But seriously they have amazing corn and their rice is very tasty,You have a choice of brown or white or both and their chicken is pretty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I go they are either out of a food item or I have to wait,This is such a disappointment because I love chipotle ,This is by far the worst chipotle I've been too,this chipotle will not be receiving my business anymore,When I want chipotle I'll be going up to Powell from now on,for more cheese to be grated,paying customer I can see the staff laughing and making jokes around the corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mediocre food that is either over or under spiced ,The food was as always,Stopped in for burritos to go,I had a steak burrito- steak was mostly gristle,The rice was dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No veggies and they did apologize or seam to care and food was barely warm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The location of this chipotle is very nice,I've never seen a chipotle establishment like this one,Idk about you but chipotle almost always has a long,line and this chipotle did not,Some chipotles serve a little, rice,I initially was gonna go for a chicken bowl ,beans,but the steak was just calling my name,Like WHOA the steak looked so tender,My husband even got steak ,This Chipotle truly knows the quality of Tex Mex cuisine,Talk about quality,Kudos to the staff and management on quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted very bl,After thinking it gave me food poisoning,The food was not good,and and was truly a bit overpriced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is good,Stopped by just after opening to snag a steak burrito for lunch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My husband chose the burrito with steak,  Chipotle basically offers a choice of three different types of burritos , I had the taco selection ,and tacos,and chose the shredded beef and chicken,the chicken was a little, You get to choose all the toppings and meat, We both agreed that the beef was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Even with no rice ,and very light on the black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the amount of food served for the prices are pretty impressive,I would definitely come back for the delicious food,my rice bowl and my boyfriend's huge burrito were honestly pretty delicious,The first chipotle I saw was built two years ago ,but they have a great taste and are awesome to use to scoop up stuff from my rice bowl,the chicken is seasoned well,The chips took some time for me to get used to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight it was the fajita veggies that they were out of and the white rice was undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can say that the workers and the time of the day really contribute to the food quality,this location is also popular for running out of ingredients as early as 6:30pm which is just sad,the best time to go is early lunch or around 7ish (even though you risk losing ingredients this late,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Definitely think something happened in their food prep process,Ordered a chicken bowl to go yesterday,but that bowl did not sit well with my stomach,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they all serve burritos,"This place still has that ""new burrito smell"" since it recently opened",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice has a good,My favorite thing to order is definitely the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Guy at the counter proceeds to serve 15 people in line after being told that I'm there and waiting on my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,Taco are good when to don't slop them together like dog food,good prices,good quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Decent enough food for a chain that serves basically burritos ,  I wouldn't say the food is great,and tacos, Pick from a couple of meat styles ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chipotle burritos aren't even as big,but since i dont have a taqueria with a burrito bar around my area (none that i know of at least) i put my guard down started coming here for my burrito,i was once a hater and never like chipotle while living in california,the corn and black bean salsa is awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this place is the go to place for quality and quantity food,from burritos,to tacos,what else is there to say about chipotle,well played chipotle,to salads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Con:  Fast food Mexican,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We always feel like we are wrong for ordering food ,Don't dare ask for the salad dressing after ordering that was suppose,to come with your salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when I get home and give my partner his food,I asked for two bowls with brown rice,they didn't even have any damn brown rice,How the hell do y'all run outta brown rice ,he looks at it and is instantly upset because they barely gave him any chicken at all,I finally make it to the meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is fresh,The only reason I am giving two stars is because I always have to watch them make my burrito like a hawk because they pile the stuff on ,the liquid which seeps through the burrito ,the girl rolled her eyes and ended up putting liquid in it anyway which made the burrito crumble in the basket it was sitting in,One way to help with this is to train their employees on how to actually make a burrito correctly ,I like the size of the burrito ,when I asked for them to make sure they drain the liquid from the ingredients they are putting on it, and tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they were out of chicken and rice for a solid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not a bad choice if you are stuck in Emory Village and craving spicy food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fuck you guys i asked for extra chicken,i shouldn't have asked for extra chicken,i paid for extra chicken ,so i asked where the hell is my chicken,y'all added some old ass motherfuckin chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoy the food here quite a bit,They move so quickly to pass your food to the next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I ask for a steak burrito to which he reaches to an empty,just give me chicken I reply, He chucks a small portion of chicken on the plate ,"""it's gonna be 5 minutes for steak""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I thought it was the burrito so I got a bowl of it instead,but it wasn't the burrito shell,it's just all the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consistent quality food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Bad customer service and the food I got last,night taste like someone dump a whole jar of salt In my food to where I couldn't eat it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tho is fine,Good old chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wonderful food ,But the food is always very fresh,There is no real complaints of the food its always great, and taste great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My wife and I are both dealing with food poisoning today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I often crave chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and good food,no baskets for our burritos,Usually chipotle is a good,dry steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she saw that and instead of just ringing me up full price she asked me if I'd like to actually place it as a kids order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
steak was salty and food was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is known for their huge overstuffed burritos which typically leave me full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is either great,Otherwise great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
though I guess BOWLS and burritos are their specialty,can I have tacos,so I can have tacos,The tacos are tiny,I was mesmerized by the white rice,While eating my bowl,mixed with the lettuce and salsa kind of appeared to be like clear,I had to ask the SUBWAY staff what meat was what while identifying the NAMES they were given HERE,the shredded white cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't know what is going on with this one but the food is never great,Today was one of the only times I have been and they weren't out of something like salsa or guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would prefer a guarantee that the food safety issues have been resolved,Had a chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Over the past two months the service and food have taken a turn,The rice is always at the bottom of the pan ,the chips are stale,the cheese is dried out ,and the lettuce has brown edges,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is fine,I personally will not be visiting any of these restaurants again until they get rid of EPS - In addition to my $6 burrito today,That's a lunch that's just a bit out of my price range,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First I got skimped on the chicken ,That received much attitude from a worker who must be getting penalized for meat distri,cheese ,and lettuce (like baby portion),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice was undercooked and my burrito bowl was flavorless,Probably my worst experience at chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here today was bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bowl over time got smaller ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or simply because it's just good food other,than college-dining hall food,Chipotle wins me over whether I'm craving a delicious crisp salad or a filling over-the-top burrito,and now they have the brown-rice option,My favorite is the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Courteous staff served me a delicious steak burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am giving three stars because I absolutely love the food,Also if the staff wouldn't just let the food sit there while they chat about whatever is more important,This was an all-around bad experience but the food was still delicious,They always write on your burrito wrapper letting the cashier know what to charge ,but the marker went right through the foil and marked my burrito,Same thing the marker got on my burrito,The first thing was they were low on black beans ,Wasn't that big of a deal but still they could have just told me it would be a minute for more black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and their rice is absolutely divine,They also have some of the most incredible lime-salt tortilla chips with AMAZING fresh,it offers some of the best meat,My only complaint is that the portions are inconsistent - sometimes I come in an get the amount of meat I pay for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Though I only get the chicken burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm a sucker for Mexican food ,Which was later concluded with major food coma,I was a Chipotle virgin until last weekend when I finally had my first purchase of their burritos,My first victim was a Grilled Chicken burrito ,My burrito of heaven came out to be $7,My second victim was a Carnitas Fajita style burrito,had the black beans,pico de gallo salsa,mild sauce and guacamole (an added charge of $1 something),I just didn't get any guacamole this time around ,shredded cheese,sour cream,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle makes the BEST damn burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fine,the walls don't get cleaned and actually have dried food on them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
) I have always been a fan of Chipotle and love the food I get there,I do not get bored of the food,Every time a veggie bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The girls serving the food were wicked,The food sits in a steam tray so Viva is marginally better than Chipotle because their food is right,For my burrito fix,Around $8 gets you a chicked/beef/pork/whatever else they have burrito filled with whatever you want,I also had Chips and salsa,The medium salsa is awesome,cheese etc (unlike Viva),sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff was friendly and food was good,The manager with the mustache one time didn't listen to my order and had to remake my bowl three times because he was too busy,Then tried to argue with me when I said I didn't want the chicken ( which he kept putting in my bowl ) because it gave me bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They put a little bit of each ingredient ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They give a lot more meat than I'm used to at other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delicious food,They also do this with bowls -- make a beautiful burrito bowl ,but your staff are checked out of the burrito library,"""Black beans on my tacos",but it didn't help that she had already unpleasantly SCRUNCHED my tacos in a piece of aluminum foil,"""With cheese ","and sour cream please""",You're so delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is still,I had a burrito bowl,no rice, The guac was a hefty extra price wise,black beans and chicken,and the chicken was cut up in such, The beans weren't cooked all the way through,corn and hot salsa,lettuce ,  My first bite all I could taste was salt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle offers tortillas in a large size or smaller corn ones and the meats include chicken,Don't pass up the salsas ,My favorite right now is the steak - it has the right,4 stars for quality ingredients,"The ""choose your own ingredients"" doesn't get old",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was alright ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You ever eat a chipotle bowl with a spoon,Staff seemed a little pissy  when making our orders and shorting us on items we ordered compared to other chipotles I have been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The guy put three little tiny pieces of chicken on my taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delicious burritos,The burritos were not made to be eaten while driving,The downside is that they really skimp on the rice ,Sometimes I get the bowl,and meat unless you say something,I don't want to pay for just lettuce and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I eat at chipotle all the time ,and the white and brown rice were doused with so much,lettuce was left off my bowl,The server was so stingy with ingredients my bowl was maybe half,The guacamole I received was brown ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By the time I got my burrito it was all cold,Love chipotle ,If you MUST go to this chipotle,When I arrived we all had to wait for more rice ,and steak to be prepared (about 15 minutes) We didn't seem to move much faster afterwards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff is incredibly rude and they give the worlds smallest portion in food,I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is always good, This is the only Chipotle that I frequent when I'm craving a burrito, and tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food,The pretty woman in front of me was given two generous scoops for the price of one,I chose to get guacamole this time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get the same thing: bowl with brown rice,chicken & steak,black beans,mild salsa,cheese,sour cream ,and lettuce,corn,tasted fresh ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As someone who only gets a few items in their burrito / burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,There's nothing like a chicken fajita burrito bowl with two kinds of Tobasco to pick me up after a long,all Chipotl chips are copiously oversalted,These are chips,the guacamole is too expensive,it's in the east corner of the triangular,and unnervingly delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delicious fresh food,For the same price as McDonalds you can get filling food,great price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its a fantastic Mexican food restaurant ,Overall the food was delicious, and the prices are average,but when I ordered chips they forgot the salsa ,and I understand some people like chips without salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
White rice getting mixed,They will stuff your bowl with 2-3 heap full of rice,"And then you will say ""No No not that much"" they will interpret it as ""I only want 2-3 tiny pieces of chicken"" and then they will compensate the rice with giving you less chicken",Then your dish is rice bowl not chicken as the amount of chicken given to you is like seasoning,I even saw chicken that got dropped on the surface thrown back in to the mix of rest of the chicken,Fajita mixing with black beans,Their sour cream is always super,It is sad that I love Chipotle and there is none close by but now I am trying to develop a taste for Qdoba or find a new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Out of food two hours until closing time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we were charged for extra chicken ,when we didn't have extra chicken,"""Well they said it was double chicken"" ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm going to include some special tip/tricks of a veteran Chipotle visitor to maximize you burrito excellence,1) You can ask for your burrito to placed open-face in a bowl, This is basically like a burrito bowl with a shell, I don't like doing this (I prefer the feel of holding my burrito while eating it) ,but these two guys were convinced that this method caused the servers to add more ingredients than usual since it eliminated the constraint of having to close burrito in the end,2) Order your burrito with two meats,May your burritos always be full,com/biz/chipotle-mexican-grill-atlanta-4#hrid:8DrkVJsYDeUjTxZ0k6wnCQ, The servers often just add two full servings of each meat doubling your payload,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dude - how can you be out of steak AND white rice at 7:30 in the evening,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also don't give you as much as the chipotle in Lenox square,the chicken is not cooked,I stopped eating the steak because it was never cooked enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hot foods where hot (temperature),cold foods where fresh,My only complaint is that I ordered (2) chips and salsa to take home,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We got home with a burrito that was split apart ,and had to be eaten like a salad (bowl of mush) and my bowl consisted of a few grains of rice dotted with steak ,but piled high with lettuce ,and corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food is good but a little over priced,80 for a small scoop of guacamole :-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle though,Gave me bottom lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they claim environmentally friendly practices and organic food,People dont have 5 burrito shops within 2 miles of them,He picks the cheese off my burrito (about half of it),brown rice,He throws white rice ,pinto beans,and black beans on,Grabs a full handfull of cheese ,""" I said no cheese please""",throws it back in the cheese bin he took,"I would like it with no cheese""",either he could not comprehend what I was asking since 'everyone gets cheese',so after the THIRD try he finally made it with the ingredients I want,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My to-go order was cold and the chips were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's not a lot of vegan options out here in the burbs but you can easily veganize one of their burritos or bowls -- just be sure to watch them closely as they quickly fling food around,I've seen them fling meat onto food that is being prepared next the one they are working on -- they did pick it out with their fingers ,I'm sure if it happened to my food ,Fairly priced fast food with some healthier options compared to the plethora of burger joints we have these days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I picked up to burrito bowls for take out,The tortilla on the side we ordered ended up being 1 single tiny tortilla that you would use for a taco ,My boyfriend and I were both shocked at the size of the bowl,The amount of meat in my boyfriends bowl left a whole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can always count on consistency of the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fairly consistent food,Food is like all chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is a flavorful burrito ,it does seem that when I go to chipotle as opposed to Moe's they are more likely to have an issue rolling the burrito ,The number one gripe for me is that despite the extra cost for chipotle burrito with guacamole,their burrito is still smaller or contains less than a homewrecker from Moe's,There just aren't enough options for burrito fillings,I have no idea why anyone goes to chipotle unless they must drive an additional,it is much more expensive than Moe's given that guacamole along with chips and salsa are not free,chips and salsa,and the ingredients,taste fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I literally just left there with a salad and the lettuce was disgusting, They were out of lettuce from the beginning of the line, Low standards on fresh lettuce Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was pretty certain I was rolling the food poisoning dice,Tried to order a steak bowl ,and they thought they were out of bowlS,Ok steak bowl please,we are out of steak,At 3 on a Monday you are out of steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean the guy took an average sized scoop of steak and put half on my burrito ,and the burritos were huge,this is not the first time my burrito has been less than okay, barely any meat,I know y'all probably don't get paid that much and you don't want to work your tush off grilling meat, I told myself If I dont have any steak in these last,but Id rather not pay almost ten dollars for something that has a ton of sour cream ,Well there is something wrong if all I can taste is sour cream,everything tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their chicken tastes a little saltier than normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My boyfriend went in to order us food,"I go on to ""enjoy"" my salad & see plastic in my food as I start pulling up the plastic",salad with so Fritos & beans,He came home & I opened the box to find no beans,So you forgot the beans,I came home & all I wanted was a chipolte salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The tables were all dirty as was the tray they gave me to carry out our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't think it's appropriate to get attitude when asking for extra rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is obviously great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food: 5 hours later I'm still thinking about the tacos,I've been to so many location and this is the ONLY one where the employees took great care and delicacy in preparing my tacos without just dumping ingredients ,I've learned that excellent management is key to a successful chipotle location ,Not to mention the meat and the beans and the rice were full,They were so delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,It's just like all the other chipotles I've been too,clean establishment and overpriced guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Employees were great and of course I loved the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worst service I have ever received at a chipotle,It's 9:00 PM and I ask for brown rice ,"and am told ""there is no brown rice""",A solid hour before closing and there is no brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your food is super,priced at $6,I asked the girl (wish I remembered the name) about the price difference,I'm asking you why the prices are so different,the price,I just returned from picking up a to-go salad bowl from my nearest Chipotle ,I ordered a salad bowl with Barbacoa,When I got to the register my bowl was $9,My roommate then comes behind me and gets a vegetarian bowl,and her bowl rang up to $6,but racking on extra charges for ingredients when you are out of ingredients that normally come included in the bowl is not a great,business practice and certainly reduced the value of the bowl overall,they were out of corn AND lettuce,I had to do shredded lettuce,Plus corn is my favorite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And by the time I get my food it has been below average,and have below average food,they are located on a corner of a busy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love taco (crispy corn) with chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a veggie bowl and the food was tasty,and the guacamole was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've worked in food service before,Well guess who got absolutely NO rice in their burrito bowl,I've always loved chipotle,This chipotle is so convenient,"I put in an online order and in the notes I put ""extra rice pretty please""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so lets start with the food review,i ordered a steak fajita burrito,the steak was cold on the inside and the burrito was mostly sourcream, and barely and beans or rice,stemming off the steak being cold,hence why my steak was still cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Chipotle is a great spot to pick up some excellent food for a good,The food never disappoints either,I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food ,So Chipotle gets 5 stars from me for a consistently great experience and great food,Tonight I went over there to pick up some chicken tacos for my wifey and a burrito for me,I had my usual: burrito with white,The burrito has a little,The chicken tacos were good,price, rice,black beans,Last but not least I must mention their chips,I don't know exactly what they put in them but you have to try their (tortilla) chips,but these chips are really really good,Freakin' delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
decent prices,Great free-range meat,fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location has he same four star worthy food as other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everyone likes Chipotle's food including myself, Maybe they think that their food will be contaminated by the a 43 year-old," So I point to the ingredients I wanted (I'm 6'6"" by the way) in a normal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband did not get his sofritas in his burrito either,You literally use a spoon and scoop things into a bowl/burrito,And did I receive tacos like I ordered,or smashed shells in a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just had the least flavorful burrito of my life,the guy who fixed my meal adjusted his hat with the same gloves on that he made my burrito with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once the food was finished preparing the cashier was nowhere to be found,The food was pretty damn,TL:DR great food a cashier with attitud,it wasnt that busy so my gf and i shared a barbacoa bowl in which it was prepared well for us,i like to have it with pinto beans but she does not so we had it on the side and not in the bowl,I noticed this and explained how it was separate from the bowl,She later came out looking a little flustered and asked if we got the beans on the side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle ,but this particular chipotle was nasty,I'm not sure if it's the seasoning on the meat or the toppings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SLOWEST chipotle on the planet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
& it's well worth it for a tasty chicken burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But other than that no complaints about staff and food,One burrito bowl usually lasts two dinners with me,I eat at chipotle now atleast once every two weeks ,but for some strange reason me and my boyfriends bowls usually get split up whole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Usually my experience at any of the Chipotle restaurants is a kind one filled with great food ,she marked my food as chicken,I requested a burrito with brown,it was a steak burrito , rice,asking about the rice which I told him,"""White rice",no beans,The African American girl went through the salsa ,he placed the proper meat I wanted down ,I purchased steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they remove all spoons and serving tools from their food , I want all Gluten sensitive  and Celiacs  to know that is is wonderful to eat good food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food prep line was also very dirty, They seem really understaffed and have been usually only having 2 people total on the line (making burritos , They are often out of something and you have to wait for them to get it together like rice or chicken,when I got home my wrapper had sour cream smeared all over it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love your burritos ,At least actual cheese is still a topping option,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoy the food at Chipotle, The food is usually well-prepared,delicious food,decent prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I also really like the rice that they put in their burritos, The tacos are yummy,I like the corn & mango salsa,Their meat is fresh and their guacamole and chips are mouth-watering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible-tasting food,stringy meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If they didn't identify themselves as Mexican food then my hatred wouldn't be this grand,By far the most pathetic excuse for Mexican food that is always packed for no real,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We love the food at Chipolte ,but are disgusted by the food prep here,When he called the manager the manager defended their safe food h,they are sloppy and gross in preparing the food,It is very unappealing as well as improper handling of food, The guy scooping the rice ,and beans dropped them on the counter and then scraped them off the counter into his hand and put them in the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle always provides good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was in line with two meat eaters and I couldn't believe how much more food they got,so why is it that I am getting less food,I like that I can get a satisfying vegetarian item for a decent price,My other complaint would be the size of my vegetarian bowl,My vegetarian bowl cost just as much, as the chicken one,Obviously they got meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I sit down and scoop out the pool of sour cream floating above my food all to find out that thr,The prep guy warms up a white tortilla and asks if i want white or brown rice,rice wasn't cooked properly ,1- I order a Sofritas bowl,"I'd like a Sofritas bowl""",steak bowl,Rice is the base of bowl ,"I don't eat meat""","3- ""I'd like light sour cream""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all you gotta do is put enough food in my bowl so I don't have to keep asking for more,Especially the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a chain but it's my FAVORITE burrito ,and taco chain around,chicken,The mild salsa ,and corn salsa,I am not sure how anyone can like other spots over this one cause the meat here is SO FRESH ,unlike other spots where the different meats all taste the same,steak,all taste different,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with huge burritos,"""Mexican"" style burritos are relatively small",tacos that are small,They're priced based on the meat you choose: Steak,big bowls filled with meat ,Like fajitas: A bowl,loaded into a bowl ,chicken (my personal,beans ,Or Nachos: Their signature sweet tortilla chips,and cheese,pretty decent salads with their specialty dressing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and i just found out all the meat is naturally raised ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I did get extra beans because I am vegan ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go at least 3 times a week for lunch and always get the carnitas bowl with a side of a burrito wrap,Like most chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is absolutely delicious,I am a very happy customer and will continue to order my awesome burrito bowl from here :, and the portion sizes are huge for the price point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I was expecting a better taste,I prefer Qdoba on taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Simple fast and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
emptying trashcans and prepping food, The chicken was burned ,and the line employee gave my wife  a lot of attitude for requesting new chicken, When they refused to put out fresh chicken,insisting the chicken wasn't burned,my wife switched to steak instead,I just wanted a combination of corn ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had to tell them that I didn't want that one and they looked at me like I caused a hassle because they had to remake my bowl,The guy didn't wait for me to tell him the salsas that I wanted ,and assumed I wanted the spicy salsa,Other then that everything tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They don't give nearly as much food as other, chipotles ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have no salsa that is mild,All of there meat is spicy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito definitely met my st,The burrito is good,Do you know how delicious zucchini is on a burrito,It was very reasonably priced for what you get,the pork and the chicken,The two meats I have tried were very tasty,although guacamole was a little,but I got it anyways bevause I love guacamole,All ingredients were fresh tasting and the lettuce had no pink coloring,For a long time I avoided Chipotle because of all the diseased ingredient stuff happening,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I don't know what it is but they seem to do burritos/tacos just a little, The staff really know how to roll a burrito , At some point I was put on their mailing list and get offers for buy one get one burritos every once in a while in the mail, Their ingredients are always fresh and the prices are cheap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My main complaint is that they sometimes cheap out a little on the chicken quality and leave stringy/grisly bits in but their prices are reasonable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I feel that this location gives just slightly more food than all the others,My old go-to order was the barbacoa burrito,but now I opt for the burrito bowl because I can mix all the ingredients together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'there is no cheese in the building',because apparently it is not his job to shred cheese,So no customer is getting cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle has some of the dankest food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is not as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She told him she would get a surprise if he ate his food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The steak was dry,I asked for extra cheese ,I ran out of sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Obviously with the quantity and freshness of their food sometimes it is difficult,Considering I've had about 5000 burritos from Chipotle in my life this review is a bit biased,As I walked away the front door opened and I was invited in for a sample burrito,and somehow I was lucky enough to get a free burrito,to wrap a large burrito ,One of the things I love about chipotle over boloco is that you can direct the burrito-ista as to how much,It makes the burrito much more personal,After seeing a sign for a new chipotle opening near my office (trouble for my wallet), of certain ingredients you want,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so each burrito had a name, No markings at all on the burritos, So imagine my surprise when I get there and I am told that they are out of the crunchy taco shells for the tacos ordered ,AND they just ran out of chips, Poor quality,it tasted like it had all been kept in the fridge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best chain restaurant burrito ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of my friends on staff at my work loves it because the food choices are so healthy,My friends were meeting us before our movie and I have lots of food allergies ,I did note that not everyone was wearing gloves as they handled food items,com/biz/chipotle-mexican-grill-austin,Out of the shoot: no corn tortillas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mike for preparing my food so tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-food line moves pretty quick,While I appreciate the food line moving quick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's extremely reasonable for how much food you get,The service is always fast and efficient and the food is always consistently good,I can't usually eat a whole burrito in one seating,I'm not a rice ,And you can't beat the prices either,so I tend to opt for the fajitas with grilled onions and green peppers or the salad bowls,The salad bowls are pretty good,I've had the chicken ,and beans in my s,and steak ,as are all the other ingredients, too and their slightly tangy honey something dressing is absolutely delicious,their sandwiches taste good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hope they don't fall victim to becoming another greedy American food compan,1/3 full bags of stale chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 stars for the food because it was consistent,you can't beat the price for healthy food,with other chipotle,My bad I should have asked for one when I ordered but normally when I eat at chipotle they always give one automatically,I like the high tables chipotle is putting in most of their restaurants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fajita burrito was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered food for one of my coworkers ,and sent another to go pick up the food,We order online regularly because we don't have a lot of time to pick up food in the middle of a shift,Since the food is paid for already on the website,the food was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's a blessing because usually all of the chipotles I've been to,I'm a chipotle fan,rice or beans let me tell you that lol because the last,The staff were friendly and they aren't stingie on the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-white rice,-pinto AND black beans,-spicy red salsa,-corn salsa,-light cheese,-light sour cream,-lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prices are reasonable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's like having Hellen Keller making your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chipotle tobasco and a chicken burrito with no beans just makes my mouth,They have the chipotle tobasco sauce that I can never find anywhere,The combo of corn salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Not a very efficient food ordering system, If the food wasn't so good,Food is excellent but every chipotle never seems like they have enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Solid Chipotle food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was great,It was the best chipotle experience we have had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With a line consisting of ~30+ people you would think the manager would not allow 5 employees to go on break and only have two food preparers,I also wonder why the cooks can make food without gloves ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they host great food which you feel good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle typically has great food,but this location in particular gives out extremely small portions and the food lacks the fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always order the chicken bowl and always ask for extra rice,I definitely feel full and knowing that the ingredients are fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50 for 2 oz of chicken and some rice,I'm sorry I asked for chicken in my burito,50 for guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,Much of the steak (like others have commented) is half fat and it's a 50/50 chance that the meat is actually marinated,I even paid for double steak to have extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my usual- the chicken burrito bowl with black,The rice is undercooked, beans,and the beans are cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 By far the best chipotle location I have ever visited solely because of her kindness ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
open a burrito chain that would fuel finance cubical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I went to chipotle for lunch because I was hungry,I ordered a salad bowl with chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Giant fajita carnitas burrito w/guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Next time I will tell them to give me more since they chop the meats into small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tasty food,A step above fast-food type, Good prices if you are looking for something comparable,to Panera's prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food ,and hair in my food ( or just the thought of it) is still bad,And the burrito was just ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But it breaks our heart when we received stale chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Classic favorite for Mexican food,and quality food, My go-to is always a burrito bowl to go -- brown, rice,chicken (sometimes half ,black beans,medium with a little bit of hot salsa,and guacamole,and half with steak), Sour cream and cheese are delicious,lettuce,extra corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's difficult to get out of the car just for food,Great food, I feel good after I eat this food,A co-worker suggested it for lunch one day - so I got the chicken rice bowl , I can buy one rice bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
knows my dish every time cause I'm a frequent chipotle-er,But the beans are vegetarian,I can't comment on the meat cause I avoid salt (the meat is just too high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm so glad I don't have to trek all the way to Copley to get my burrito fix now,This chipotle is super,Yay chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the staff is friendly & I probably won't go to another chipotle unless I really want it & not close,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would definitely split the bowl with someone next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I love the food here, Though I can't stop eating the food,the line does move but prepare to wait 15-25 min to get your food, Always fresh and always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
found a live roach in my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Personally I find this place a bit pricey compared to boloco or other burrito joints around the chinatown/downtown,Although i have to admit that their burritos were huge,most likely not on my own because of how pricey it was ,Also their bowls are slightly bigger than boloco,they dont bother to skin the chicken before cooking the meat,Also the chicken ,i asked for a salad with chicken,with extra lettuce and extra chicken ,and how small the salad was,and pork were kinda tasteless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is good,and the quality is consistently declining,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I worked in the food industry for almost 10 years so I tend to take exceptional,notice to specific things in every food establishment I eat in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is cold,The quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fine,this time they failed to fully wrap my burrito,typical Chipotle quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super rude bad customer service food gave me food poisoning I had the Barbacoa burrito never again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
knows I dislike mexican food,I always order the same thing chicken burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the past I haven't had the best experience with Chipotle's food,She let me taste her food ,today at Chipotle Lavista I had the most DELICIOUS burrito bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My fiancé and I eat chipotle at least 4 times a week ,I know chipotle is generally very high,in sodium but my local chipotle on orange ,and every time we com to this particular one the chicken is so salty,each bite taste like pure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The major appeal seems to be the weight of the food you can get for well under ten,It's not the worst Tex-Mex food you'l,Both offer counter assembly of burritos or bowls with rice,bland tasting imitations of a mediocre Tex-Mex burrito,beans,guacamole,lettuce ,and a couple of other ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No chain Mexican food is worth,This chipotle had a 30 minute wait during lunch on a Wednesday just to get to the counter,I got a salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their burritos,tacos & burrito bowls are all so yummy,I've only had their chicken ,because I can't bring myself to try the other meats (which I've also heard are delicious,All of their ingredients are made daily,  and you can tell by the taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Employees are friendly and the food is always fresh,I feel like they need to allot just one employee to maintain the lobby of the restaurant as the mess makes you wanna leave as soon as you get your food,Busy chipotle location in Emory village, and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I have more than on one occasion gotten very little meat , One time when I asked for more meat,the employee gave me attitude and said that what she gave me was standard and I would have to pay for double meat if I wanted more meat, I explained to her that in no way was that the standard amount of meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always relatively fresh,Pro-tip: Try the half and half chicken/steak burrito,try a cheese quesadilla for under $4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location was out of white rice,black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tables with food everywhere,rice spilled on the ground ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is still good,The food is hit or miss,The other times the food tastes like it's been cooked,the food fresh,Your watching hot food go to warm to Luke warm,I've eaten at chipotle in different,Remember this is in comparison to other chipotle restaurants,1in5 times it tastes,and taste consistently the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I ask for a little more I am given little scraps of chicken or little sprinkle of (brown) rice,Once I asked for double meat ,Of course the quality is still delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overall the amount of food I got was far less consistent,First the amount of ingredients I was given in my bowl was definitely less than normal,but the bowl I got smelled like cigarettes as well,The chicken was almost out so I got the scraps which was not the usual,The employee doing the vegetables was busy filling guac and salsa cups ,I also got chips ,and guac and did not get enough chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she had major attitude and acted like the customers were bothering her by showing up and asking for food,straw covers and food crumbs all over the floor,the food ,who was in charge of adding the salsa,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and nothing will deter me from getting my corn salsa fix,""" or ""Can I get a lot of sour cream",is freaking delicious,It tastes just like the rest of them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
found some sort of tooth in my burrito,My friend also had tomatoes in her burrito ,This chipotle is disgusting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most addictive food ever,but i could eat this food everyday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but you'll be hard pressed to find another taco place that offers tasty responsibly raised / grown food with such a small,you'll find that many of the food options have yet to be prepared,I question how clean the food prep-area is because I saw a roach,I know that is blasphemous in this land of amazing tacos (i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Their food is fresh,FRESH delicious food,so I ordered a bowl with white rice,black beans,a couple of salsas,My hubby ordered chips , humanely raised meats (I don't eat them anyhow ,guac (xtra charge) and lettuce,barley and some other ingredients,My daughter told me that her Vegan boyfriend brought her to one and that it was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a consistently awesome place to go to for yummy fresh food,My favorite is either the burrito bowl or even the salad (you don't even need the dressing),Also great are the tacos and burritos,marinaded chicken,tasty salsas,fresh guac and sour cream,How about some fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This used to be a decent location but the turnover of the staff has made everything suffer from inattentive service to the poorer than normal quality of the food,Been to some chipotles with suspect service but never a chipotle with food quality issues until this location,A gentlemen up front stood there and did nothing while our food sat on the counter next to the bag,and when we told him that was our order he nudged the food in our direction still out of the bag,Easily the worst chipotle I've been too ,The managers don't know how to ring up a side of rice ,Got fajita veggies in my bowl the other,and beans rather they charge for a veggie bowl which is a $4 difference,not to mention they still hadn't put the chips we paid for in the bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm tempted to avoid this location altogether as I believe the experience will take away from my enjoyment of the food,got my burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was tasty,the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food is consistent,The price is reasonable,and tastes fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came in here just as they were opening and ordered chicken ,AND steak,the steak took a few,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresher since it's early,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I was the only person in line waiting to get my burrito made,and the 4 employees behind the counter stood around and talked for about 2 minutes while I was standing there before someone decided it may be a good idea to make my burrito,So as I was eating my chicken burrito,I kept noticing that the pieces of chicken in my burrito were pretty chewy,and all they did was ask me if I wanted another burrito (hell to the no) ,I took a good hard look at some of those pieces of chicken,and I noticed that the chicken was completely raw,I went back up to the counter to let these jokers know that they were serving a raw batch of chicken to people,and didn't even check the chicken they were serving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If I'm already paying way too much for food,but without the salsa the food doesn't taste too great,but instead I got less of each than my fiancé who ordered a chicken burrito bowl,I expect to get a decent amount of beans ,2 stars for the employee (bless her heart) not being able to adequately dish out the black beans ,but the nutritional information for their salsas (which I do like) are pretty,5 oz of the tomato (mild) salsa has 470 mg of sodium,I'm avoiding this chain now because their salsas are all just too sodium,When I order a vegetarian salad,I put a picture of the lackluster salad somewhere on here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is saying something because chipotle is part of my weekly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the absolute slowest chipotle I have ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They actually give you a mountain of food like ,Best chipotle in Boston,when chipotle first opened,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But for my carnitas burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My FAVORITE place to get a vegetarian burrito around,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff was quick making my burrito,I love chipotle's chips ,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but almost always order their vegetarian salad or burrito bowl just because it's the best tasting, I've tried all of their meat products,the vegetarian meals just taste better to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
staff is friendly and the ingredients are always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not even on the food line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
giving me a few recommendations of what I should have in my burrito,and they were always smiling as my burrito was being loaded , I had a chicken burrito,I would recommend this place to anybody looking for a fairly priced,and the chicken i had was just right,and it was not only delicious,and delicious meal,The quality was better than i had initially expected,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took forever to make our food,they hardly put any rice into the burrito,My husband's burrito wasn't even wrapped,the chips were stale,server overheated the kids's cheese quesadillas causing the cheese to burn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the employees made friendly conversation with me while they prepared my order and the food,If you're a fan of Chipotle or just need a good mexican food fix,Was delicious as always,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was on the spi,steak burrito bowl for the husb,and and chicken burrito for me,after they do the kids meals the person assembling mine throws my burrito away,cy side not that i mind but the kids did and the chips were stale overall I'm going to say it was OK not good not great it was not badly priced ,:-( so we get in line and the kids menu isn't on the menu so we grabbed a menu from the side wall ordered the chicken quesadilla for the kiddies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22 Minutes for my burrito to sit in something that was wet,could not figure out how to put salsa or cheese in it ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sofrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always warm,fresh and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great Service and food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only thing that made this a review up to two stars was that the burrito was delicious,(I went for the steak instead,The pork tasted a bit too salty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location is always busy and although a tad slow my food is always excellent, They give generous amounts of all the toppings and my salads are always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 All hot food was cold,they were serving dog food,if they feel safe serving that food tonight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is what you grow to love ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
particularly at busy times when they seem to be unable to time their food prep with demand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always great,Im being nice and giving 2 stars because of the food,The sour cream and salsas were all mixed in ,And when I asked if I could have ranch and vinegreete for my salad they looked at me like I was dumb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but Chipotle offers are pretty good back-up if you want a decently priced burrito,They add a bit too much rice though,The rice is sometimes too under-seasoned, for my tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I only come to this chipotle location because it is the closest one to my house,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finally Emory Village has another option for fresh quick a delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is my favorite Mexican food chain,My favorite is their steak burrito,The portions are huge compared to the price,The cilantro rice is to die for,All of the other ingredients are very fresh and their salsa is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burrito's are huge and tasty and the burrito bowls are great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hungry and annoyed with free food, I asked twice but they could not make our burrito ,and burrito bowl for another twenty-five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
engaging and friendly - absolutely NOT what you normally encounter at 'fast-food' places,but the food was absolutely AWESOME as well - I got a super, I just stopped by to grab a burrito for lunch - place was PACKED - the line was at least 20 people long, tasty carnitas (pork) burrito with black, beans,salsa ,and with a side of chips and salsa it was still well under $10,and with a side of chips ,including the people back in the kitchen cutting meat ,and corn - couldn't have been better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle's food ,I think chipotles, rice ,and sauces taste better ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Definitely the best Americanized Mexican food around,I really like the carnitas fajita burrito, They will also add fresh lettuce and salsa if you ask,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" you wind up with food piled so high",they can't get the lid on your bowl,I asked and paid for extra steak ,The quality of staff at this location is questionable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I'd like to have SOME green leafies on my burrito bowl to help (mentally) offset the ridiculous, I asked for lettuce ,pieces of shredded lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better than any of the meat options,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Peruvian lady serving my food was so disrespectful,Only gave it 2 star because the food is good,Ok I love chipotle ,I prefer to go to a chipotle with employees who take their job seriously ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they were out of lettuce,Okay so I had to get shredded lettuce for my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is very hard to mess up a burrito where even the ones at a gas station is decent,It tasted very good along with the chips I ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Surprised how awful the food tasted,And surprised how the food looked - sour, I should have walked out after seeing the food options,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get that sometimes it gets busy and you might get rushed and mess up or randomly start loading my bowl up with cheese ,and sour cream even though I specifically asked to not receive any,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went for my usual order - burrito bowl,white rice,My bowl seemed unusually small,all the salsa,steak,sour cream on the side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is my favourite place to go for spicy authentic Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thought it was a cheesy taco joint,When I crave a good taco ,The bowls are good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do not get meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One lady gives 1/2 portions for full price,Good portion control doesn't mean skimping and selling me Lettuce  and a few beans at $7 a bowel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But they have the same great food that I expect from Chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,as usual but I don't know if it was the rush hour or what but I haven't seen a dirtier chipotle ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not looking for fancy just fast decent food,Food was typical hope the chicken won't give me food poisoning,Waited about 5 mins for chicken they rush it,the chicken might be slightly undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is typical,It's chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fast service and decent food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food wise,spilled food by h,Staff need to be taught about cleanliness and changing gloves when serving vegetarian food,I always get chips with my burrito bowl order,it's another chipotle,It was only close by chipotle,But now there is one more chipotle opened,I saw meat overflowed in sofritas,and and using the same glove to add cheese on your plate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
luke warm/cold burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Normally chipotle gets a 5 star,Shared parking lot with an LA Fitness and poor parking lot planning makes it a very high traffic area for non-gmo meat lovers ,and meat heads alike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food may be 'fresh,lackluster service quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
)  I personally thought the food was great,Chipotle staff using sign language with a customer today - apparently listing ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh,The quantity of food that goes into the burrito might have an effect in the difficulty of actually keeping everything nicely packed in with the tortilla,I am still to get a properly wrapped burrito from this,A burrito that size wrapped in aluminum foil should look like a big,I will be back (sight) as I have not found a place in Austin with a decent burrito that is fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I found a bug in my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And if you get a kids meal be prepared for them to only be allowed two toppings for their taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
artificially-flavored food substitutes you get at other,"""real"" ingredients ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is so hood ratchet they're not even hood rich  the people in there  always rood or they're not paying attention to what you want on your bowl they're worried more about teaching each other Spanish and talking to each other and giggling and laughing like I hate this chipotle every time I come to this chipotle it's a bad experience and only been here three times I make it my decision to go out of my way to other chipotles just because this one is so distasteful the stars is for the food lo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great food,Great prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and quality Mexican food for a reasonable, price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food also tastes very bl,portions and quality of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always love a chipotle burrito,even though I am not a vegetarian: Vegetarian burrito,with pinto beans (not veggie safe,corn salsa,hot salsa,So good you don't even need the meat in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They will change their gloves and have corn based options for tacos,Great ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ask them to mix up the ingredients in your burrito before they roll it,every bite is full of deliciously healthy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best burritos/bowls ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burritos,Wonderful bowls,and lime flavored chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notorious for leaving the salad dressing out of the order almost EVERY time,It's part of the salad so how is it they manage to leave it out repeatedly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been going to this chipotle for a while ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's chipotle so you already know how the food is,Large burritos,and tacos,bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even if you are being ""good"" the food is still tasty", Usually I just grab a burrito bowl to go,get brown rice instead of white,The guacamole is fresh,get the awesome guacamole ,"I like that you can be ""bad"" and load up with sour cream and cheese or you can be ""good",and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on top of that no one knew what consisted of a kids taco meal,By far the worst chipotle I've been too,Asked for a little bit of rice as I was getting double, meat,it had to be rewrapped 3 times and then finally double wrapped which made everything mixed and tasted like shit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is great space to enjoy your burrito bowl in the store,A vegan burrito bowl is a terrific,This chipotle location is the best, value filled with fresh ingredients and guacamole included,Portions are large and ingredients are always fresh,The selections are great for everyone to make their perfect meal and the ingredients are fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually get the burrito bowl (now with brown, rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not ashamed to say I'm a chipotle-freak,I have to get my chipotle craving satisfied at least once a week,If chipotle had a punch,I would get so many free chipotle bowls,this place seems pretty inconsistent with the way they cook their rice,One day the rice is very good,I've gotten it to-go several times where the rice wasn't cooked all the way,If the rice is too hard,that entire bowl is no good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chips are also bl,This is the only location I've been to where the meat is always room temp ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On Friday I ordered a chicken bowl,I may go back for the chicken sometime,Instead they gave me steak,I figured I'd give the steak a try,The steak was simply inedible,"I picked out the ""steak"" ",I know this is fast food but you'd think if your whole deal is letting people pick their own ingredients that you'd actually put those ingredients in there (or not add things that people didn't ask for),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and both experiences consisted of slow service and stale food,sub-par food,I ordered a veggie burrito bowl with brown, rice,black beans,and corn salsa,The salsas lacked flavor,and the corn salsa's texture was strange,I also ordered a side of chips,The chips didn't have the same,guacamole,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ordered two bowls to go,And the meat in each bowl was missing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No complaints on the food other,whenever I get a quesidilla I do however sometimes get different price some around $4 sometimes close to $7 ,and that is for a large with chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing out of the ordinary just good quality stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is dry,The counters are also dirty with spilled food,When they hand you your order it will have old food smeared on the bottom,Well the food still sucks,in the center of my dry nasty bowl,We don't need that many Chipotle locations if the quality is going to continue to decrease,and tasteless here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I barely got rice ,and beans either,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never found terrible quality at Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One dude hadda mess it all up with his ""we are closing soon"" nasty response to my inquiry about the empty barbacoa bowl he was picking my SCRAPS from",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My boyfriend got the smallest burrito I've ever seen,They put a bunch of nothing in my burrito bol ,and then top it with a ton of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always amazing,If chipotle was to do queso I would probably be buying it every time I went,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But no clue on helping someone with food allergies,He just passed my food down ,Needless to say I was frustrated at that point and I bought my food that was definitely cross,And for the record having Celiac disease is not the same as having a food allergy it's worse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But seriously I ordered 3 bowls and they were all wrong and missing about 1/2 the food,The food was not fresh,They put probably 2 full spoons of sour cream on my bowl,which made the bowl a creamy,which 3 ingredients were left off of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We weren't asked if we were dining in or out but they packed our food to-go,Came here for lunch and ordered one steak bowl ,and one chicken bowl with guac,"So we have only been to Chipotle a hand full of times but when we asked for ""re-fried beans"" we were given a blank",OK next time we will read the menu that they only offer black or pinto beans ,but have they never heard of re-fried beans,"""we only have pinto or black beans"" would've been nice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20 minute wait for chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you're looking for some tasty food in a pinch ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Chipotle's food,it's still great food,and you often have to wait for certain ingredients or whatever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would like to say that it would've been really nice to know that this location is actually INSIDE the mall in the food court,but when I got there at 1:00 my food had not been prepared,by the time I got back to work (about 2-3 miles away) my food was nowhere near hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but some employees tend to be inattentive and sloppy with the food,it is also wildly overpriced at almost $2 per serving, Although the guacamole is very good,The quality of ingredients is relatively high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Get the kids taco kit if you want a light,You can two soft tacos with three fillers,a small bag of chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I actually had to ask for more rice,He acted as though he didn't hear my request for more rice,then flippantly adding more rice without saying a word,as the amount the young man initially put on barely covered half the bottom of the bowl,filling my bowl with black,he quickly flung my bowl across to the condiments without even asking me if I wanted veggies,I've been getting this exact same bowl for probably 6 years now,and I've never gotten so very few veggies in a bowl,As they finished my bowl,My boyfriend was also appalled by how skinny our bowls were compared to other, beans,He asked me what meat I wanted,I noticed the trend in skimping on ingredients,I understand that providing quality ingredients is expensive,I will drive the extra five minutes to go to another location where I'm not nickel and dimed on ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Husband and I are feeling very ill after having a lunch date at chipotle today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It isn't the worst food nutritionally,but the fast service and good price point is on point  This is a relatively new, I usually opt for the chicken salad with most of the fillings ,The ingredients are fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She proceeded to give a half of a scoop of rice in each bowl,If I am paying full price I expect rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even after the recent closure of all their locations to deal with food quality training,A recent barbacoa burrito my spouse had was more than 50% gristle & fat,This place is the worst chipotle we've ever seen,if we ever eat at chipotle anywhere ever again,quality of the meat is often subpar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The girl who made my food rolled her eyes at me ,Not only that but the final gal who rolled my burrito barely even rolled it ,when I told her the salad right in front of her was not mine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Go for the bowl and save 200 burrito calories,I love the chicken,All natural fed meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love getting my food fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the chips tasted stale,I ordered a salad ,I told them to please give me salad dressing ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but when I am basically getting rice ,and beans you can spare a whole extra scoop of rice that costs ten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The chips were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great choices- the guacamole is ridiculously good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
brown rice,I had the salad with chicken,pinto beans,tomato salsa,corn salsa,and sour cream on the side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The brown rice was a little,Thank you to the employee who comped my salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This particular location ran out of steak and their brown rice was very undercooked,and his rice was also very undercooked,I was given a BOGO for my long weight for steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A cockroach was on the food line counter ,and not even one employee seemed concerned while we watched it crawl on the food counter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chicken ,The meat quality is really superb,and steak is cooked very nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They didn't know how to properly wrap a burrito ,and it was distasteful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We had the low carb burrito bowl,The real burrito with tortilla is huge,fresh chicken & guacamole,The chicken is best,a few beans,You can also get double meat,The beef steak tasted a little,couldn't tell if it was me and my daughter's taste buds or the actual steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40 for a burrito,Not only that but I could not even chew the steak (gristle) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Part of the beauty of Chipotle is that they have a simple menu (will that be burritos,The burrito with carnitas is awesome,tacos,I also get the soft tacos , * SOFT taco, * BLACK beans, * CORN salsa, Treat yourself to a bag-o-chips and salsa if you like, The medium salsa is perfect, * NO meat - remember, * Plenty of guacamole, * NO sour cream, * NO lettuce,or salads for ya'll, Food is served quick and it is genuinely high quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the portions are generous and the food is delicious,my go to spot when i'm craving rice ,and beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are extremely slow at preparing food,They are also always out of food,How about you just make my food ,I asked for tomatoes in my burrito,The productivity at this chipotle reminds me more of a city construction team than a fast,I mean the other salsa made primarily from diced tomatoes,They were out of chips at one point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They never fail to give you that burrito that would seriously help you cross the Sahara,Skip the chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burrito bowls for the win,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please note: This review has nothing to do with the food ,I have eaten here before and it's your run-of-the-mill Chipotle so you know what you're getting food wise,The earliest they could prepare my single salad was 1:30pm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and my food is usually waiting for me at the counter,I only once received my food cold,but that was because I probably had my bag of food waiting at the counter for 20 minutes,but I always get my food with no mistakes,I am sure they are stressed out during the lunch rush with everyone flinging beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of the food was very good,though the tortillas felt a bit tough about the edges on both my and my wife's food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
salsa,but being on the Whole 30 diet has opened my eyes to a simple salad with Carnitas,The manager of the restaurant even offered to rustle up some fresh raw red onions for the salad as a nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ordered that and a burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I normally get the steak burrito or you can get it in a bowl,What is in that lime-rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the guy standing between the food prep ,the food in the tortilla was fine,"""Pork burrito"" shouldn't be too difficult",Everything added after this point was fine until the burrito was rolled up,but worst case scenario is they have to take bites from different parts of the burrito,Unless the person rolls the burrito like this Chipotle person,but she had forgotten what meat to use after putting on rice ,I had to take it home and put it in a big bowl,but it was prepared so poorly that it had to be poured from a tortilla into a bowl to be eaten,and some people don't like the layers of ingredients,maybe in an attempt to mix ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's similar to any burrito place where they construct a burrito,and you can have your burrito in the traditional,a burrito bowl,they gave me a store credit for a free burrito,taco,toppings including a selection of brown or white rice,or a salad bowl, One example was affter not having any chips,costs much more than a simple bag of chips, They have several types of meats (no tofu unfortunately),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Custom made burritos,burrito bowls,and tacos,The only thing that I'm not a big fan of is their chips,but the quality is fantastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dinner rush with a line out the door and a guy who couldn't roll wrap a burrito to save his life,I mean it is chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where the food court is lacking,reasonably priced,Chipotle is always good - fresh ingredients,delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the blond chick keeps sliding the other customers food along,I was so upset - I couldn't even finish my food,So a nice polite blond chick starts my salad bowl,""" And he obviously is upset at everyone and like throws corn onto my salad and like slides it to the next person and she finishes my bowl finally",So the blond chick obviously took control of situation and started putting my meat on salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they didn't put my guacamole in my bag that I watched them make ,they are continuously out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But that's because it was busy and the food is amazing,I love the chicken and the steak bowl I had,Food was delicious as always ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and being from California I've had more than my share of Chipotle burritos,The first time it was ripping the tortilla while wrapping my burrito,today it was not enough brown rice,Last time they didn't have enough meat,plus they forgot to give us salad dressing with my wife's salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my burrito was half the size of a burrito I normally get because they skimped on every single,stingiest chipotle in the world,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is one of the best chipotles I've been to,Our bowls were so full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think this is one instance of a larger food issue in America,but I guess as the daughter of a farmer and as someone who believes in sustainable food,I got my veggie burrito,Why when the side of a tortilla splits is a burrito suddenly worthless,The burrito was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in my bowl,when they have a sign about the shortage of chicken - think twice,and lack of true flavor (the salsa was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food here is nothing to play around with,Come here when you need to get a monstrous burrito to satisfy your crippling hunger,The guys and gals at the counter are quick and ready to make a slamming burrito,taco,or bowl of the fresh, ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yet the fact that their wrapping skills were subpar was unforgivable for a burrito restaurant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,but when she stated they were out of brown rice ,"and asked if I wanted plain rice I said ""no that's ok","I'll wait for the cilantro rice""",puffing and rolling her eyes because the lady was taking awhile to decide what she wanted on her bowl,even though my order was screwed up and I had to ask 3 times to go back and add hot salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awful food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I did what any snarky foodie would do: I pulled out my phone ,There were 21 people in the line in front of me & I made it OUT THE DOOR with food in h,Each and every person likes their burrito or their bowl a certain,If you can't wait 7 minutes to pay $6 for a delicious burrito,Love all the angry folks who have popped on here to write angry reviews about not getting enough rice or something trivial,For example: if I want more rice,"If I want just a ""little bit"" of sour cream",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was a little,but I was told not to get the corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We're talking about walking down a line and making a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and didn't get our food until nearly 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She pulled out a long blob of whitish colored hair mixed in her food,I ordered the chicken brown rice bowl ,while I was waiting in line to pay someone who was in the middle of eating came up to the counter with her meal and showed the employee something in her bowl,I got a small bag of chips on the side with hot salsa for $8,cheese ,and lettuce,and added corn,Overall good quality of the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but what takes the cake is getting completely ripped off for guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Y'all the queso tastes like bl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get the steak rice bowl,they do not give you enough rice or steak, It makes me sad when it gets to the meat section because they have this tiny,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thinking that is just another stupid burrito place, I recently tried to make a burrito at home the same, Chicken burrito with rice,These burritos are huge,it is the Jasmine rice with lime,chicken,black beans,chunky salsa (mild),I also get chips and chunky salsa to go with it, The chips are overcrusted with big,cheese ,and lettuce,"I don't know what is the ""secret ingredient"" as someone has said on these reviews", (If there is a secret ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stopped by for a quick burrito after Universal Studio closed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the pinto beans were hard,The guacamole was old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is like any other,chipotle ,Would totally recommend going to this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The menu is the same as every other Chipotle so I'm not going to talk about the food,After getting my food I was extremely disappointed,because there was WAY less food than normal,I would've been okay with this if there was a compromise in price,The reason for a lower rating is because on one of my most recent visits they ran out of bowls,but no bowls,Their solution was to use the covers as the bowl ,  since the cover can't hold as much as the regular bowl,but if they ever run out of bowls again I will get something else,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The last time I had Chipotle was almost 10 years ago and I remembered they serve gigantic burritos which I'm not a fan of because they're messy, I don't like rice and beans too much and that's all I had remembered about Chipotle burritos,I've gone back a few times now and I really like ordering their chicken or steak salad,In my salad I just skip those items and and make sure to get lots of the roasted chili corn salsa ,and red chili salsa,I skip their salad dressing too because I prefer the red chili salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 On the negative side - the food was bl,I have zero relation with that company) and other food places nearby, I almost couldn't finish my burrito ,such as for sour cream or salsa), There's a Moe's essentially just around the corner (that's an honest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
completely filled with dropped food ,  The girls running the food-line came out to fill up with soda as they walked over all the trash on the floor,The associate wrapping the burritos couldn't do it to save her life,Instead the wrapping was covered with all the gunk off the table and the burrito fell apart,he asked what was in our burritos because no one had indicated it on the wrapping,He then took the half wrapped burrito ,and smeared with salsa ,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my white rice was drenched in lime and I had to throw away my burrito it was so bad,only to come home and have my burrito fall apart due,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
take a tip from Freebirds and Torchy's and let your servers smoke a few bowls before work so they mellow out and go with the flow making burritos ,and tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place is the worst chipotle I have ever been to,They run out of rice often,meaning 20 minutes until rice is ready,Everything they make needs rice,Also they run out of chicken,steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then while getting my food I got barely any rice ,Choose a different chipotle if you can ,and when I got rice I got the burnt,Servings has gone way down to almost only half a bowl,Very little beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always great food,You always get plenty of food - it usually last,The barbacoa is my personal fav but carnitas (chicken) is pretty,The guac is a must but the chips are a hit or miss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think they put crack in their food, You can get two tacos, The black beans are vegetarian,but the pinto beans are not, If you're getting anything veggie guacamole comes with ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle burritos for me ,The woman told me to pick two sides for their taco meals,Then she said I needed to pay extra for meat and cheese on taco,And why the hell do you have to pay extra for chips and salsa,At least they are friendly and you get free chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They forgot my daughter's chicken for her make-your-own tacos,Ignored my asking for a side of beans,Handful of chips with guac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today was the first time I ordered a salad at chipotle ,Every time I go to this location the chicken is nothing ,and I got very little lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You really never have to worry about waiting too long to order your food,and great food,I'm not one to eat spicy foods ,and their food isn't very spicy, I've had their tacos too,with white rice,My favorite dish is the Carnita bowl,pinto beans,It's pretty rare for them to run out of a meat,a little cheese,and sour cream,fresh ingredients made right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually order my food to-go ,I visited this location twice this month and both times I received brown guacamole,and by the time I get home (8-10 mins later) it looks and tastes disgusting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything has changed including the freshness of the food to the attitude of the employees,I went here this afternoon to get a burrito bowl,I also asked for a side of guacamole,When I looked at the guacamole,When I asked the employee for fresh guacamole,she informed me that they do not make fresh guacamole ,I get back to my place to eat lunch and the guacamole was completely brown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chipotle is my absolute favorite ""fast-food"" restaurant",Amazing fresh food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They ran out of some major essentials: brown rice,so there was no reason for the mess on the floor or the lack of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and believe we will see this type of business model in more types of food,I still go because they make great food,low prices, High quality ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He went out of his way to ask how we were doing and made sure the food tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So now I'll have to make yet another trip there to deal with an embarrassing inconvenience that was the cashier's fault and all for mediocre food,burrito we make,I used to go every Monday after the gym and order a steak bowl,Back then the meat was lean,inedible pieces of meat I have to spit out ,I had to stand around and wait to get the fajita veggies and the giant glob of guacamole was turning a dark,"What happened to Chipotle's moto of ""it all really comes back to the people behind every ingredient we purchase",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I normally just get the chicken salad with little beans and rice,medium and hot salsa,and corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After twenty minutes I finally sat down to eat my burrito bowl ,brown rice,and white rice, They were out of steak,Service quality starts with management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their corn is always cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's Chipotle so the food is great,The meal they were eating was a sackful of burritos from Moes,Chipotle employees eating Moes burritos inside a Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They filled the bowls we ordered very generously,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And I know that everyone has differing opinions on what makes a good burrito,I want my burrito hot,Why does everyone LOVE chipotle so much,these things aren't even rolled correctly - the size of your head with rice on one side (which by the way is really tasty,meat somewhere else,whatever other ingredients you asked for haphazardly falling out here ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While the food is pretty good,Once I got my food I had a line of 20-something,The two stars is for the burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keeping everyone entertained and excited for the food they were about to buy,Long live chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been subjected to some of the best and most authentic Mexican food you can get in the United States," I also love ""Californian Mexican"" food that's a bit less authentic",there was a burrito joint on every corner , The build-your-own style is the best for me because I am vegan and very particular about what goes into my burrito,I ordered the veggie burrito,It was one of the best burritos I have ever had,95 burrito, The guac is free on a veggie burrito,which I got stuffed with cilantro-lime rice,black beans,corn salsa, I was a little bummed that the guacamole costs $1,and lettuce,healthy ingredients,which lists all ingredients ,Chipotle is a taste of home,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time we buy bowl in any chipotle they not put enough meat on the bowl only rice ,99 to eat rice ,and beans so we pay $7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My chicken burrito was absolutely tasteless, The chicken was dried up ,I also ordered chips ,The chips did not have the lime on them like they should've ,and guacamole,and the guacamole was lacking in the jalapeño,same quality ,Hopefully they will get some quality control ,and turn it around to be the same quality as the rest of the chain,and same taste no matter which ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The meat is not great and you put cilantro in every element of the burrito - the meat has cilantro,but if you wish to have a burrito then I will point you to Moes where they will welcome you with open,the rice,the beans more cilantro,the salsa,I will say that the chips ,and guac are good until you find a way to put cilantro in the chips as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything has changed including the freshness of the food to the attitude of the employees,I went here this afternoon to get a burrito bowl,I also asked for a side of guacamole,When I looked at the guacamole,When I asked the employee for fresh guacamole,she informed me that they do not make fresh guacamole ,I get back to my place to eat lunch and the guacamole was completely brown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By far my favorite burrito/taco chain, The pricing is straight forward and their burritos are huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was fine until I ate the food it was the only,food that I consumed all day ,and I believe that the black beans were going bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 food all over the floor, A pile of beans on a chair,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst food quality ever,It's in a Very busy location which is my guess as to the low quality food,The first time I ordered a chicken burrito,and the chips were disgustingly chewy,the meat was stale,sour cream was milky,The employees are friendly but man the quality sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The server did give me more sour cream than I asked for ,and the ingredients are fresh and they went out of the way to get me fresh salad greens even ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the fresh peppers but I wish the food could be more hot, I like my food pipping hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We asked for a bag of chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great quality food,Additionally the chips always seem stale here,The reasons I didn't give 5 stars: today I ordered/paid for a side of guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
brown rice,My favorite is a bowl with black,chicken,beans,with both corn and hot salsas,Their tortillas are unexpectedly soft and just plain delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine just happens to include spicy food,As for the food,I usually get the Barbacoa burrito bowl,This location is the first time I was OVER served Barbacoa which is saying a lot because I am capable of eating the entire burrito bowl in one sitting,like some crackhead strung out for her salsa fix,Yes all the salsas,It was so fall apart in your mouth delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There food is moist, I always get the crispy tacos(the best,they gave you 4 tacos , The guy told me the tacos are bigger ,and now you only get three and they have raised their prices,and they give more meat(no they aren't ,I'd still go back because it's the best meat you're going to get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Long time chipotle fan and absolutely love the food ,I guess chipotle making all the money don't really care about staff or service anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is always fresh,I love the cilantro-lime rice,please do yourself a favor and make the switch before you break a tooth on their extremely stale rice,and the simple yet delicious guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Stood to wait for my food while they rushed to make it, Its amazing to complain about being served too much food , Too much rice and all the toppings were what was on my hubby's burrito - NOT what i ordered, His burrito was sloppy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice,I always order salad no beans,hot salsa,double meat,extra lettuce,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
though everytime you need wait in the line for a while，the food is really good！,people working there are very nice and give you so much food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is very consistent, I always do wonder why their chips are always unevenly salted ( same,you will find a few chips that have all the salt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food does seem a bit inconsistent,Sometimes the service folks may forget to get you a sauce or ingredient,but the taste itself is the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never seen this in a chipotle before), Portion size is small especially considering extra charge for the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food at this Chipotle is what you would expect from any Chipotle--no surprises there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good thing I don't have food allergies,I came in here and ordered a veggie burrito ,Other times I've found cheese in my burrito because the cheese,and ended up with a few pieces of meat in it because the servers are sloppy, sits right next to the guacamole,The ingredients aren't fresh,I know this because I can taste the huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I stopped at this chipotle and bit into my burrito, I quietly took my burrito back to the register ,it contained frozen corn salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can never go wrong with chipotle,They always taste great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get the bowl with Chicken or Carnitas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chipotle is chipotle= solid food for 8 bucks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today I dined at chipotle ,He not only added the perfect amount of cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-And pretty good quality food~,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am a tex-Mex/Mexican food aficionado-so,But I have been dipping my foot in this pool since last spring/summer after hearing my food friends love it,The only thing I've tried after many check-ins at various locations is the rice bowl,I am sooo sold on the brown lime rice,especially chicken ,(It's sooo hard to part with so many ways to serve chicken,(every other time was steak and chicken once,I hate their chicken),The tofu was sooo flavorful-it tasted like a better version of chicken,###nomoremeatforme,and steak,AND I love a nicely cooked steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered food using the mobile,app and when I got there 30 minutes later the girls working behind the counter laughed at me while they told me they threw away my food because I was too late,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have never had to take my food back to chipotle until today,I opened the container and it looked like rice soup with guacamole on top,I don't know if it's management or what but this location has the most inconsistent service and quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They're also fast and the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Usually okay but if they are busy they seem to forget that they need to keep making food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they really only make burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food always seems fresh,it seemed like the people there didn't like their job or weren't interested in making your food, I usually get the same thing (a veggie bowl) ,unless it's meat or guac, and tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I used to get double scoop of white rice with double,layer tortilla but nowadays I get a bowl,and tomato salsa ,Had chips,Meat was juicy and all the other ingredients were fresh,it is still delicious ,It was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Slowest chipotle I've ever been to,the Guacamole looked disgusting and they were out of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and their rice is consistently seasoned well ,and cooked meat,they have never run out of ingredients,your standard Chipotle order can vary from mind-blowingly delicious to bl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food,The highest quality food for the cheapest price,Burrito bowls are a Crossfit ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This day in age some chain restaurant folks put funky stuff inside of food,The food here is always fresh,burrito,taco,and everything so they end up giving me a mountain of goodies on my rice bowl,I'm always mixing and matching since no matter what rice bowl,During my vegan trial period I would come here to purchase brown rice with black,beans,I do not like mystery horsemeat swirled with r,corn,salad you get it's always on point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't mind the food here,and gave you minimal amounts of food,the food is sub,I know working in the food industry is draining,but it will do in a pinch or when a member of a party just NEEDS his chipotle fix,"The ""humane"" meats they serve here don't taste bad",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
super clean remodel for this chipotle from the previous,now a chipotle in every neighborhood of the west,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food tasted kind of bland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it hits the spot when you need a quickie burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is not the issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food ,The bowls are great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One was measuring temperature of the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food here is nothing to play around with,Come here when you need to get a monstrous burrito to satisfy your crippling hunger,The guys and gals at the counter are quick and ready to make a slamming burrito,taco,or bowl of the fresh, ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is good,and very accomodating and flexible as far as making my kids' burritos/tacos/etc just the way they want them,one of my kids (spice wimp) ordered a chicken burrito,at least two staff personnel came to check on us to see if the second burrito was more to his liking,Chipotle can feel on the pricey,against my better judgment since I know there is some kick to the chicken,guacamole ,especially for extras like guacamole, quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My main gripe with this location is the noob burrito rollers,I got nervous as I watched my tortilla with filling get molded and unmolded and remolded into a burrito,the workers here still seem like theyre working on it compared to the burrito ninjas at the toco hills location,I was surprised to find out they were opening a chipotle in Emory Village,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and every single one of the workers tries to skimp on every single ingredient like they were trained to withhold food from us or something,and almost took a picture of the taco-sized burrito they tried to make me ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food: is awesome,I swear they add some secret drug to the salsa that makes me crave a burrito bol,and the cilantro lime rice is the ONLY rice I will eat in a burrito,At lunchtime it seems like the entire population of Sunset Valley wants a burrito,A pilgrim must suffer in order to reach the holy burrito grail,burrito devotees,no rice,black beans,the salsas are fresh,roasted corn salsa,The guacamole is the only,cheese,The sour cream is creamy,sour cream,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time we go we feel like it is a 50/50 chance of our food either being delicious,The ingredients are slapped on and they are sliding our burritos down the line ,This has to be the worst chipotle we go to,We love chipotle, If it weren't so convenient to have this location so close to where we live we would drive to a different chipotle as we have has better experiences ,There have also been a few instances where this location runs out of ingredients by 6pm on a Friday or Saturday,Over the last several months the quality of service has truly diminished,The employees need to take their time to ensure a quality product is presented,Efficiency is important but so is quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had stopped eating at this location prior to all the food safety issues last,when you finally got to order your food -- I go for the bowls -- you'd have to practically beg to get more than half a spoon of rice ,Staffing hint: a goth waif verging on anorexia is probably not the best person to be portioning out the food,"This was most surprising given all the ""free food"" campaigns they've done recently",If I want a burrito,they still managed to always be out/low on some ingredient (rice,The waifish rice-nazi wasn't there,I asked for double chicken in my bowl,and beans,beans,meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are constantly running out of something and very often the food is improperly seasoned,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chips were good,they should check for the missing ingredient in the steak,A type of ingredient was missing so it wasn't as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The grilled chicken is crispy and delicious and I especially like the chipotle honey vinaigrette, The salad selection is piled high and for the price a very satisfying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice was dry,Late this afternoon I grabbed a carnita bowl to go, beans were just old,The meat was far from the usual,bland turkey meat from a can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sadly the food is good,AND they forgot to put gucamaloe on my burrito bowl,I walked into Chipotle on my Monday afternoon to pick up a simple chicken bowl for dinner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you like meat don't go to this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a chicken burrito with veggies ,It made my burrito soggy,The chicken was bl,but it tastes like nothing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While I like the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so they threw the whole plate of food away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One time my bowl was very heavy with a disproportionate amount of rice,bypassing the long line and bringing a healthy fresh buritto bowl back to my desk,and today they forgot the corn salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,I've had the food at another location ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The workers at this location are very friendly and you can see them preparing the food in the back,I also like their tacos,Props to them for offering the brown rice option ,Last time they did run out of brown rice ,Now I get a mixture of black and pinto in my bowl,so I keep going back to the bowl,and for making the pinto beans vegetarian also (they took out the pork,I also realized I can ask for the chunky mild tomatoes and add on the medium salsa,And I do wish their lettuce topping wasn't mostly the hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went in looking for a sofritas burrito,25 for sofritas/meat,because to add meat the menu says ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle order I ever got,Less meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delicious Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chipotle never fails,sometimes ill mix it up and get barbacoa and steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted fresh,I ordered the chicken bowl which was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have increased the prices while the food has become shitty,If the food was worth,The food is pretty overpriced for the portion ,They need to get better employees along with better food,It's shit food that will give you the shits,It's something like $6 or $7 for a burrito,That has increased while the bowls and burritos have become less impressive,It used to be free guacamole ,and quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
brown rice ,I always order a bowl with pork or chicken,Can't go wrong there and sometimes depending on my appetite I'm able to make a meal out of the bowl,black beans,all the salsas (hello,I am usually disappointed by the chips,the chips should be salted ,which is a same because when made right they are the best chips in town,Regardless of the chips,and topped off with lettuce,Several times a week my taste buds physically crave this Mexican,Leftovers still taste pretty decent,they are usually stale and tasteless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The young man wrapping up my order gave it to the person after me and gave me her food,This continues to be the worst chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered from Postmates and my chicken was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was getting the chicken burrito for ages,if you don't want things included in your burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My son and I were eating dinner the other day and he mentioned how he missed San Francisco burritos which we used to probably eat at least once a week,These are far from the best burritos Ive ever had , A burrito from here equals dinner plus a lunch leftover for me,I am bitter that I let my free burrito coupon expire even though I had it hanging on the fridge for weeks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Their food is yummy,and I will choose it every time I am in the mood for a burrito,there will also be the same deliciously,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff seem to hate their life and the food is bland,Probably because they know their food sucks so they're trying to get rid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have to say that this establishment inside Perimeter Mall's food court is very,I've been here at various times of day and the line moves fast with about 3 or 4 people behind the counter passing your burrito bowl along down the line,The burrito bowl is delicious,They have cold water in to-go cups ready for you to just grab on your way out and the gal at the register has basically memorized prices of basics,Brown rice,chicken,I've learned to skip the salsa ,It's the perfect combination of meat,onions and cheese,and the corn because I only guilt myself into including them ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of food has gone down significantly in past,Since then the food has been cold,There is no consistency in the food preparation ,You may open your burrito bowl to find tons of black, bean juice with a few prices of cold,Another bowl gone straight, burnt chicken scattered around,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've eaten here multiple times and not once has the food been good,The management should eat the food once in a while to have an idea as to how bad,Uncooked rice,over burnt vegetables and cold grizzly chicken,No quality control at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burrito bowls are the way too go,Fresh ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and while they could do a better job with consistency of the food,Food quality is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time i go in there the quality of the food is the same,I'm a fan of the chicken burrito,I would recommend getting the salsa or guacamole ,and chips as well,The chips have a touch of lime ,adding guacamole it will set you back $1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Me: ""Seems like too much food",because I thought I was going to get a burrito the size of my arm,"Me: ""So it's kind of like FreeBirds but you don't have to get the jumbo burrito",2 tacos,Do you think I can get tortillas on the side to build my own tacos,"I headed home with my healthy ""taco kit"" ",and gobbled down 2 tacos ,(4-6 tacos depending on the tortillas) ,a bowl OR a Salad ,light black and pinto beans,toasted chili-corn salsa ,and fresh tomato salsa (aka,and you get to pick the meat ,Me: (feeling all expert now) ordered a salad with 1/2 steak ,cheese ,sour cream ,and lettuce,and 2 corn tortillas,"Nice Older Gentleman: ""My co-worker gets the salad so she can save the rest for leftovers",and other ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had a burrito bowl ,The rice had crunchy pieces in it so I'm sure,The chicken was luke,The lettuce looked wilted so I passed, The portions and quality at this location are just too small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however since I brought a burrito bowl back to the office one day, The burrito bowls are an awesome, The bowl works better if you don't want to make a mess of your dress shirts, My only issue is what meat selection works the best here,with last week starting around the corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their chicken burritos are filling ,Don't get me wrong I like chipotle,The mild salsa didn't taste quite right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then the food stopped tasting good,My bf went there and they ran out of white rice,They ran out of white rice,They offered us brown rice instead or we can wait 20 minutes ,So we decided to wait since brown rice just doesn't taste the same,"Their reply was ""Sorry - we forgot to turn on the rice cooker",And now they ran out of rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but now the ingredients have become super,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always ask for more rice , On several occasions the rice has been undercooked, and too many pieces of chicken have been overally chewy,and meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the worst chipotle me ,Do not go to this chipotle they have horrible,I'm going to stop eating chipotle  all together as a whole,She threw the bowls around ,and didn't respond when we asked to just wait for the fresh steak instead of scraping the bottom of the combine,After waiting she gave us half portions of steak just because she could,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location is never consistent with the food they serve,They give such little portions I often wonder are the employees being charged for my burrito,If you like chipotle just avoid this locatio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inconsistent food portions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They used to have good food,They have crappy corn tortillas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't believe it's specifically listed on the menu (except in kids meals) but you can order 1 single taco vs,the 3 they give you in the regular taco menu item,I think I fell asleep at my desk after the first time I went & got the 3 taco meal,I learned my lesson & now I always get a single steak taco with a side of chips & salsa,The chips are off the hook,the home of $11 salads ,The ingredients are the freshest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is the worst one that I've been to in awhile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my Chipotle burrito with medium salsa,and the prices seemed reasonable,The chicken ,and steak were nicely flavored,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But when I used the app and very detailed told them what I wanted and it said my food would be ready,Then when she handed me the bag of food ,Other than that the food is great,my salsa that came with my chips and my side of rice,I politely asked her can I have my chips ,and the kids meal chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was cold ,This chipotle IS A MESS,and they had no guac cheese or corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rice & beans w/meat burrito for too much, Why don't they have the salsa bar, Others in the area have this place beat hands down for taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- corn salsa,- guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He pretty much made it seem like I was lying since he stayed that Noone else got sick off of the food at that location,I grabbed a chicken bowl to go,Got home and ate the bowl got maybe  2-3,00 as the chips and guacamole was free with their new rewards card and inky had about 3 bites of my bowl,I got chicken ,mild salsa corn,Then got chips ,and guacamole on the side,",sour cream ",and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was so dissatisfied with my food that I started to pick at my friend's chicken,""" or ""bowl or burrito", burrito- ,I had the barbacoa bowl-90% of the meat was just gristle/fat,And the meat,but all of the meat was so charred,"""sour cream","organic sustainable"" or whatever- but it tastes terrible",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I order the burrito bowl with black,no rice, I eat my bowl with their tortilla chips, I essentially use the bowl as dip,chicken,The chicken is so good, I am not a huge fan of chicken breast,beans,corn salsa (extra, The corn salsa is delicious, It is a healthy meal without the tortilla chips,guacamole , The guacamole is one of my favorites ,tons of cheese (more,and lettuce,which are delicious with a hint of lime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every so often I get a poor quality product,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and old food on every surface,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've bought chips 3 times now,Typical great Chipotle quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Noticed when I was eating my bowl that it was bland,or even cheese because I didn't see it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 stars because this is the third time I order online to pick up and open my order to basically no food,I more than usually order ahead to pick up since the line gets crazy inside but you just don't get the same amount of food which majorly sucks,I just wish they would serve you the same amount of food as they do ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also the rice is often undercooked,I love the reviewer who was told by the manager to just eat her salad with a spoon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Addictive food because it is fresh,mushy and disgusting looking like some burrito places I've regrettably been to),and I usually opt for a burrito bowl to save myself the carbs of the tortilla,Their brown rice is really tasty,Try mixing chicken ,salsa,and a hint of cheese, I then load up on lettuce,corn,It's like my own tex mex salad, They use really great quality ingredients-,really delicious,Super delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They barely put anything on your burrito,I usually absolutely love chipotle,Tiny amount of rice,beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 After I received my food, I was misled about the ingredients in the food that was prepared for me,we don't have any food allergies,I ordered chicken tacos with soft, I took the tacos back to the cashier ,corn tortillas,my wife and I thought the tortillas looked like flour and not corn,and asked her if they were corn, She finally admitted that soft corn tortillas are not sold at this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grill Master in the back was showing off his grilling skills to apparently VIP access members with no hair nets and long hair flopping all over my food,I am seriously disappointed with the quality of this establishment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only problem is that the quality of the burritos they make for you ,given the lack of good burrito options in the financial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our food was cold,We eat at a chipotle a couple times a week,Worst chipotle experience ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Adding to a noticeable drop in food quality,and even the freshly made burritos are only slightly warm, Their ingredients seem less fresh, However the last two times there have been far below their previous level of taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice, Had a bowl with carnitas,beans,green salsa,cheese,and the roasted corn topping,and the corn add just a touch of sweetness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I paid for my food ,(Who knows if he washed his hands before serving more food,I took my food ,I took the uneaten food to the register ,2015 and ordered a burrito bowl,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It still  bothers me watching my food already made just sitting there on the counter,The difference is its cheaper for the same quality food,Price is a bit higher than the completion across the street,And guacamole is free,Why is a little scoop of guacamole  2 dollars at Chipotle anyways,HEY MANAGEMENT maybe you need two cash registers instead of another person scooping  corn and sour cream,Food quality varies ,"I've tried the ""other"" place and taste ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The price is okay and the food doesn't totally suck, It's a chain type joint and the food is pretty,I guess i could add that you can get more than one kind of salsa on your order ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
problem is you don't know this until you're already through the line with your order & to add insult to injury you've already paid to dine in with your burrito bowl which you clearly can't eat there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But I had to literally stop eating my food because the food had so much,I had to throw own the rest of my food ,I thought the it was just the chips but when I started eating my chicken bowl the whole,entire bowl was extremely salty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also the burrito ,My favorite chipotle wasn't wright this place,and bowl missed half of the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's almost as if something is off with the taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So if you want some quick Mexican food that is not Taco Bell,Prices are a bit much,I order the 4 hard Tacos with chicken,all 5 salsas sour,Guacamole and the corn and green tomotolto (sp) salsas with a drink,I love their chips, cream cheese and then I order chips, Everything including the guacamole is made fresh,75 for a 3 Chickin Tacos) but you get what you pay for and that is good quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she just gave me a huge pile of cheese instead ,Idk if the server was tired or frustrated but when I asked for lettuce,I even pointed at the lettuce,It's not a big deal to me as lettuce is purely a texture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Come on I don't have the time to drive to chipotle I pay extra,Second time and still don't but the dressing on my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lettuce was old and soggy and the chips were incredibly stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I thought maybe I had been wrong but later found out it was true when I bit into chewy meat for half of my burrito,I don't like like my meat well done,but I was shocked at how red the meat was as they were serving people,Another huge dislike was that the steak was really undercooked,A star earned for location and another for being a familiar taste,the same Chipotle taste that I am used to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Secondly we wanted guacamole that was offered to us in the past for a dollar inside the bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
During my visit the manager walked out and asked how everything was and took our empty bowls once we finished,The chicken,queso and mild salsa was a great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's standard two scoops of rice in a bowl - for any chipotle I've been to,They tried spread out one scoop of rice,Same with the beans,And meat, And cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The 5 stars are based on relative quality - obviously this is a fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pros:  This place has great Mexican / southwestern fare at a reasonable price,they ran out of white rice,so I had to wait and watch the cook prepare more white rice,- At the second station they ran out of sour cream cheese,so I had to wait for the sour cream and cheese to come out,- The lettuce was kinda rusty,and corn,- They scraped the bottom of the bucket for the corn,- At the beverage station there was no way of determining the difference between the SweeT Tea and Unsweetened Tea without playing the iced tea taste test challenge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food met my expectations,versus the burrito,  I opted for the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fine,They don't call back for food until the dish is empty,After waiting 30 minutes you don't want to place an order to find out it will take 20 more minutes to get food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There really needs to be an option that says ""no stars""   Granted today is narrional burrito day there is NO excuse for the horrific",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food ,but Chipotle is decent enough and comes at a good price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is not very tasty,My wife likes the burrito bowls,The staff needs to focus more on cleaning and upkeep versus trying to push the over-priced, bag of chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good food,Good prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chicken quesadilla,chips ,The guac tasted bland and the chips were stale,Add more lime to your guac and serve fresh chips daily,If you're going to sell day old chips,I didn't get much lettuce at the bottom of my salad,Tip: don't be greedy with the lettuce,It isn't called a salad for nothing,The guac tasted bl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consistently good food (I'm probably here twice a week),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Pricey without the coupon, The salad with carnitas and guacamole was great,unlike most salads,I've always been a fan of Chipotle and their use of fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go back because of convenience and I like the food ,but I really wish they take the few extra seconds to make people's food semi easier to eat ,Today I got steak and salsa in between my tacos ,and not actually IN my taco shells,I love their crunchy hard tacos ,but they don't do a great job putting together my tacos 8 out of 10 times,They are inconsistent with the amount of meat they put in each taco ,and they never drain the mild salsa so my tacos basically turn into soft,tacos by the time I get back to work,I don't know how they do it but every time I get my tacos to go,it's the worst chipotle I've been to,I might as well be eating a salad with chips,they are probably in a hurry and always run out of meats due,Another downside is their undercook steak (close to rare),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It's food,The big thing Chipotle has going for it is that it actually is food (earlier I said fast food is just food,but that's not really true - it's not food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I then noticed that they had a grand total of 1 server putting the food together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As for the food,The steak and rice tends to seem a bit bl,The taste of some of the ingredients seems to taste a bit off from what I am used to in other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every chipotle I've been to between GA,NJ and NY never put eXtra sour cream until this chipotle,I always slide for extra sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for some salsa ,I asked her if they had any more salsa,I noticed that she had completely filled up the salsa bin,I commented that there sure was a lot of salsa in there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amazing every single part of my experience hear has been great from the peaple where great they where very helpful and friendly and the food was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food,10/10 recommend this chipotle if you like to eat food that tastes good,I've been to quite a few chipotle restaurants ,More delicious than any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even if you order online ahead of time you still have to wait at least 30 minutes to get your food,The staff is friendly and food is typical,Chipotle food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't think I need to speak about the quality of food of Chipotle,It's delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are a mess,The chips are good, The ingredients are really bland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle sucks,For chicken rice ,chicken,beans ,and beans,and salsa ,The only thing I asked for was lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is good,"its a quick serve mexican ""style"" food", Or a HUGE burrito tortilla," My daughter loves the taco ""kit""", What kid doesnt like determining how much and of what gets into their taco,do you want it in a small taco size tortilla, Maybe a bowl because your on a no carb kick,chicken, they have several meat offerings, The meats are all tasty,The guacamole is fresh,steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 All food is fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food at this Chipotle seems off,Perhaps its the seasoning in the rice or salsas,It doesn't taste horrible,but it doesn't taste great,but it just never tastes as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do this because the amount of food that you get for six dollars is so large,I order a burrito bowl ,In fact I usually stretch one bowl into three healthy,On the three stars side I find that they are stingy with the amount of meat ,non-antibiotic and non-hormone feed meat,and guacamole that they give you ,Next for the fact that they use quality ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not the best chipotle,Update: the woman with the curly long hair will give you half a serving of chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice,I got chicken,salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sure the food is great,organic food,As for food recommendations: burrito bowl,and hot salsa(for those who love it spicy like me),any meat,you'd get the same delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle ,the pinto beans were atrocious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food here is extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food very fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't know why the fuck I keep coming back to this shit hole of employees and inconsistency of food,coli that was found in their food,They look miserable and pissed having to make your food,All the sudden their annoyed as if their paying for YOUR food,There is no love in their food,I hope the 2 servers that were making my husband and i's food tonight show up to my place of work so they can experience what it means to have Excellent Customer Service ,and give them a taste of great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#chipotle why are you taking orders through the app at 11680 University Blvd in Orl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their burrito bowls,burritos,tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do hold chipotle responsible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now I returned the burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fajita bowls were quickly made,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just recently ordered two meals from them off of Door Dash and paid extra for both bowls to have guacamole,When my order arrived they both bowls didn't have guacamole,either make a claim online or come to the store when they have guacamole to remake the bowls,So I said I will be back in the store tomorrow to get new bowls made ,When I called the store they said they were out of guacamole ,and the lady on the phone said that she can't guarantee me there will be guacamole available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Tried to eat from the top but most was stuck and coming out of the bowl with chunks of grease clinging to it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
long sleeve shirt on that kept touching my food while she was making it,Anyone in food service knows there should be no articles of clothing touching anyone's food,"When I said ""excuse me your shirt keeps touching my food"" one of the workers said ""her shirt is clean",but the shirt in my food,the manager agreed to give me one free burrito Instead of the original,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
adding salsa,cheese,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where you pick your meat/protein and then option of bowl/burrito/salad, My chicken burrito was poorly wrapped also , Moes burritos alone will fill me up, I wasn't impressed and the chicken in it was the only,but I get more options at Moes PLUS a salsa bar ,no jalapeños and no chips included,and chips,Chipotle is the product of another chain copying another chain and trying to provide fresher ingredients, I know people say Chipotle has fresher ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Literally had to ask them to make me my food because it had been 20 mins,Definitely not the chipotle you want to go to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst service I have ever received in a chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they were out of the normal burrito bowls,They were also out of the brown rice option,so they were putting it all in the salad bowls,The MASSIVE amount of guac that the woman put onto my boyfriends bowl was insane,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got back to my car to find out they put the wrong burrito in my bag ,i would give negative 10 stars if possible (the burrito in my bag was double,literally the worst chipotle maybe of all time,brown rice ,and nasty fatty steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have never liked their food much,but it's not the type of food that you can reheat later,I really don't like having to assemble my tacos as if I'm eating a Lunchable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Probably one of the best fast food mexican style now that they will have cheese it will be even better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,Didn't get our 1st order of salsa,didn't get correct 2nd order of salsa,and got queso instead of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They wrapped the burrito with the top,the burrito was cold as it just came out of the fridge,half where you can see the guacamole is coming out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cold rice,Cold chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 There was no chicken we were informed, The steak they did have was burnt ,you'd think you'd place customer service and quality at the top of your list,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My bowl was amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Before the food was excellent,Cleanliness at a food establishment should be a PRIORITY,wrong meat (I order online to pickup so I don't find out about this until I'm back at my desk) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Cali vibes and fresh food model officially ranked this location for me,This review is based off of really great chipotles I have been too versus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 people not doing anything when no one is fixing people's food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not worth it and after looking through other reviews it's clear they don't take the time to allow you to get your money's worth out of your food,Love a good burrito ,I got guacamole so my whole burrito wouldn't be dry,So annoyed I spent an extra $2 to not be able to eat my burrito,Ok feeling stupid leaving a two star review for a freakin chipotle ,but I've never been so annoyed about chipotle,I didn't get salsa or anything else that might make it spicy like that,but this guacamole was literally burn-your-lips-off,With no corn or sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do yourself a favor and go to the Norwood chipotle between 8pm-close,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food looks good,The food tasted great,I will be back to try other foods,I ordered some crispy tacos for carry-out,The tacos were a little, however I would probably sit in to eat next time or have them put the tacos on the side next,I got the steak and chicken combo tacos,My friend got the pork tacos ,I also added guacamole ,and it was fresh and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm standing here looking at the food ,) for some burrito bowls that didn't make it to the END of the assembly line,But I can't walk into a chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 With so many other decent food options nearby,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two burritos is what we got,And the chick that wrapped my burrito must have been new,I could help but giggle as she folded my burrito into the middle,Two stars for the burrito,The cherry on top is that there was a whole half of an avocado that was not ripe that took up at 80% of the guacamole in my burrito,I pulled it out after sinking my teeth into it not realizing it was there and walked up the counter and said hey no big deal but can I get a scoop so I can actually have guac on my burrito ,I've been to A LOT of chipotles ,I had like no joke 7 pieces of chicken until I asked for more,Also stop skimping on the ingredients mah dudes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Almost every piece of chicken in my bowl was burnt to a crisp and ruined the flavors of every other food in the bowl,I usually love Chipotle but today I had the worst chicken bowl of my life,I ordered a bag of chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didn't think businesses were in the habit of giving out free food to anyone who claimed it,only to find that they had forgotten my chips, When I called them to see if they could offer a voucher for chips the next,but tonight's interaction with the staff left a bad taste in my mouth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
every time i am overcome with suicidal urges i head out to the nearest chipotle and pray to god i contract one of the many diseases in their food or choke on a grisly mound in their burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food itself isn't the issue here ,food splattered on the counter window ,When I FINALLY got my burrito bowl there was no apology for the wait or lack of selection,out of chicken,I had to wait an additional 10 for them to cook the chicken (there was no way in hell I was going to leave,out of corn salsa ,and out of chips,When it was finally my turn to place my order I was informed that they were out of steak,I have never once been in here when they have a full selection of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I may have converted from a burrito person to a taco,I ordered chicken tacos,The taco meal comes with three tacos,Their chips also tasted better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food bins that they scoop out of are a sloppy,mess & food is all over the floor below/behind them,The steak and chicken are over cooked with lots of gristle and fat & the food is not fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was a bug at the bottom of my bowl,I seen something start moving when I reached the bottom of the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So basically all I got in my bowl was chicken ,Last time I went they were out of bowls,and mild salsa were out ,corn salsa ,lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle location I've ever been to,- they put hot salsa on a bowl even though no hot,chicken,salsa was requested,They lathered this thing with hot salsa,- out of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was hungry and afraid that it was going to take forever to get my food ,Not only that but it seemed as if all the food was fresher than my normal,As i was ordering my food,one employee was checking the food ensuring that there was nothing that need to be changed out or refilled which made me feel good,It was reassuring to know and to see that they actually cared about the food that they were serving, chipotle visits,I ordered a bowl with a tortilla on the side (Chipotle hack- if you didn't know,Everything was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Undertrained staff and mediocre quality food,Spent a good amount of time on the toilet due to the terrible food,I love chipotle ,Went to get a vegan bowl for my friend to go and when I asked the girl making my order if the rice ,and beans were vegan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for a shit ton of rice ,and she proceeded to hit me up with an EXCESSIVE amount of rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
plastic in my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also pay full price for half the food I get compared to other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if this chipotle delivers one more order to me without including the vinaigrette dressing on the side i will end my shi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have no problems at all slicing fresh meat for me, when I asked do you have fresh steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I understand it's busy hour but don't literally scrape the edges of the tray and put in burnt scraps of food in there,Ask people to wait while you get more food,They put nothing in the bowls even ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go to chipotle fairly often ,and I use to work at one and I know mobile orders aren't fun but they did forget my protein in my bowl ,and my chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food on this was very fresh,I know chipotle has been trying to redeem themselves after their troubles from a couple of years ago ,Their bowls are a decent price,I almost always get the barbacoa bowl with cilantro rice,I did think something in the bowl was on the salty side ,black beans,mild tomato salsa,Plus the corn salsa which I find super,I did add on guacamole but I think I would be ok next time with just extra sour cream or salsa,and cheese,sour cream, delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered through their app and chose to have my food delivered,I contacted the manager and although she was very polite and apologized it is very annoying considering this always seems to happens at chipotle,She went ahead and told me that I could contact chipotle to get my $1,chipotle will forever be life,I ordered chips with my bowl ,and not only did I not get the chips but my bowl was also cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They went ahead and charged my credit card for just the bowl,One of them asked if I wanted a drink and chips,assuming that they had included the chips,When I opened the bag to see where my chips were,"""Where are my chips",The chips were not included,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is really fresh,The chips are pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came to order a food at 9:34pm ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a barbacoa burrito today ,and got steak instead,which would be fine if their steak tasted okay-which,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yesterday my husband and I were full for hours after splitting a burrito,salsa , We also got chips,and guacamole all for under $10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They did not put the meat on my burrito bowl,the chips ,and guacamole are extremely salty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is my favorite chipotle,friendly staff and they load up your bowl, The meats are properly h,Lettuce is fresh and the guacamole is to die for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location of chipotle is a hit or miss,You are better off going to the chipotle down the road on Alafaya,Someone who works there does not know how to make the white rice,The rice is served in hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tasteless food,I was charged $26 for a single bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food station where the meals are prepped was quite  unkept,there's a recall on lettuce or both ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the beans taste uncooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lemonade washes their food down well, Standard procedure of going down the assembly line and having them assemble the burrito,burrito bowl,I went with the chicken burrito, Get the Chipotle sauce for your burrito,or tacos of your choice,brown rice,cheese,lettuce ,and corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perfect food in a perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Asked for light rice ,and got about 3 grains of rice--the bottom of the bowl was barely filled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One new bonus: they offer a brown rice option - with no additional,including a variety of hot sauces & salsa,and the guacamole is actually some of the best out there (even compared to expensive sit-down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They get 2 stars for the food , then I had to ask for lettuce to be the main ingredient in a SALAD bowl,It's just lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think the peppers and onions are huge part of the bowls ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And if ya want a burrito don't be afraid of this Chipotle in the Pearl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I still love the food though ,I usually order a burrito however they do a poor,job of wrapping it and the burrito always comes apart,and the chicken tastes amazing,Whether it is cheese,or some type of ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I typically order on the app and then pick my food up,The last time I went I got there when my order was due and waited 25 minutes and still had no food,But not being able to make a burrito bowl in 45 minutes is ridiculous,I don't know if there's been a management shift at chipotle corporate,but lately it seems all chipotles are going down the tube,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5 stars: no real complaints on the food besides it wasnt piping hot,Behind the counter where they were preparing the bowls and burritos was very untidy,Most chipotle's have horrible,Sidenote: sign up for the chipotle app ,Price point: 2 stars: i hate how they nickel ,But my bowl was good,I bought the funky ass chips and salsa for $2 ,So far i earned a free stale ass chips and 2 tablespoons of guacamole lol all kidding aside thats how much salsa,The guacamole and chips or even the queso totally not worth it ,and the chips were stale,and guacamole they give you with 2 tons of stale chips lo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is just kind of gross and you would think that they would pay more attention to that with how often chipotle has been in the news for food related,It's often really messy where burritos are being made,I have eaten at this chipotle about 100 times in my life,you will probably never wait in a longer chipotle line anywhere else in the nation,it seems like their version of speeding up the process is just throwing the ingredients in your bowl as fast as humanly possible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As for the quality of the food,I still love myself a burrito bowl,but sometimes that just isn't the case based on how filled the bowl is,The chicken is usually grilled nicely,The guacamole is always good,"I put in the request field ""extra lettuce""",I would think that he would get an extra scoop of lettuce,I'll give an example: I always order my husband a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always fresh food ,good price and good food,and today we get the chicken tacos,I normally order the chicken bowl,it is delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the WORST chipotle in existence ,I only eat salads at chipotle ,This chipotle is a disgrace to the usually wonderful,and I enjoy the dressing that COMES with the salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get the chicken bowl with lettuce and rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,One of the best things about Chipotle to me is that it's easy to customize your food,I typically get a burrito bowl ,Once you decide what entree (burrito,) and protein you want you work your way down a line where you can add rice,bowl,beans,salsas,sofritas is incredibly flavorful and a protein I'm sure vegetarians and meat eaters alike would enjoy,sour cream and guacamole,salad,quality ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got chips and salsa,see picture for the whopping 10 chips we got,Also got a salad with the smallest amount of dressing possible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and by the time it was done I got to sit down to a cold bowl of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered food to pick up so it was ready,when I got there but instead when I got there come to find out that hadn't even started my food yet ,Ended up waiting about 20 minutes to get my food still,They're always out of food ,I eat at chipotle religiously,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesn't take long to add up for free food,and often their rice isn't fully done because they are in such,some days you get someone who gives you one scoop of rice ,when you ask for double rice,Sometimes they run out of ingredients after the dinner rush,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who exactly are you rationing food for,The serve was sooooo conservative with the chicken,she scooped HALF of a spoonful of chicken,I kindly pointed out the half serving and another server walked over and asked did I want double meat,I don't want double meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is a great addition to this food court,Maybe I'm getting jaded from all these Chipotle bowls,my most recent veggie bowl was salty as heck,cheese or guac,but even if I didn't add sour cream,I suspect Chipotle is adding salt to everything besides the fresh lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What matters most is customer service and the food quality,I'm not a fan of other chipotle's in the area - so this is a fabulous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some of the employees don't know how to wrap a burrito correctly,the chicken is burned on the edges,There are always soggy chips in the chip bags,The guacamole has frozen chunks of avocados in them that are impossible,they also ran out of cheese,How does a Chipotle run out of cheese at lunch time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burrito,or tacos) ,I love chipotle ,The chipotle honey vinaigrette gives so much,The rice has cilantro ,You order your entree (bowl,Both the steak and the chicken are always delicious,and lime added to it and they have both black and pinto beans,mild salsa,and sour cream,salad,Chipotles best kept secret is their salad dressing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they decreased the portion of food you get wether it's a bowl or burrito,They are almost ALWAYS out of a lot of food ,The quality of their food is absolute,This is the absolute WORST chipotle you could possibly go to, crap compared to a regular chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chips were hella stale and I had a literal half of a fricken avocado in my burrito,My burrito dreams have been crushed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the dirtiest chipotle l have ever visited in my entire,he proceeded to tell me corporates contact was on the chipotle website,Not only that he tried to debate with me about it being a rice shell,l know what a rice shell looks like ,He proceeded to bring out a grain of rice with a shell on it ,The pics below will show the finger nail which l took a picture of in the palm of my hand the the other picture shows the rice grain ,I called to inform the establishment that l found a fingernail in my bowl,I was told to bring the bowl back with the fingernail,inside the bowl,I know what a bitten off finger nail looks like and that's exactly what was in my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was very excited it was super convenient for food I've been traveli,Before i even ordered my food the line cook notified me that what ever protein they had is what's left,"Last but not least while we were eating in side the music is very low so we can hear the crews conversation as they were saying ""eat your f****** food already",At this point me and roommate didn't even want to finish our food really felt unwelcome,Love chipotle ,This kind of turned me off from chipotle,I looked at the time it was only nine twenty then i noticed the grill guy cleaning the grill so it was obvious that they were pre closing  and didn't want to cook more chicken i really wanted double,chicken ,but i came with my roommate so there was only one portion of chicken left i knew he wanted some so i was being generous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one of whom was cooking the food,very disappointing because I've had good experiences at this location before in terms of well cooked food,I'm just not willing to risk my health or that of those around me for a good Chipotle bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they won't make your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a burrito bowl for takeout with corn,None of those things came in my burrito,salsa,cheese,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I would rather eat at Chipotle than any Mexican food place in Orl, I prefer it to either the carb and melted cheese variety of Mexican food or the overly-priced,fusion food, But the guacamole is excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LOVE Chipotle and it seems weird to review a fast-food chain on Yelp,but I am consistently disappointed with the food from this particular,but the food is just odd,You should know what your food is going to taste like no matter which location you choose,So if you like good music and mediocre food,There's always something not right -- the rice is not cooked properly,the chicken has a weird, lemon-y taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First time the Carnitas salad sat out for 15 minutes cooling while one guy tried to make all the orders ,Gave us spoons for salads,For a chain that prides itself in quality this outlet is an embarrassment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Otherwise the service is fine and so is the rest of the food,I have ordered a side of chips every time,their chips are stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This week they sent out a free burrito coupon,but on a day when I needed a big fat taco ,and enough rice ,beans,salsas, Bring your meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let me start by saying that I usually love chipotle,Unfortunelty this was the worst chipotle I've ever had ,and white rice,they were out of bowls,and the chips were stale, and tasted like old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food prep room,I get the impression that service quality declines as it gets closer to closing time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfriendly staff and bland food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always come to this chipotle because I live close by,Who doesn't love a bowl that's packed high,Usually get chicken or steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was fine,The chips are always stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Usually I expect mall food to not be as good,Congrats to working in a mall food court ,I've been to many chipotles , as going to an actual location but this chipotle always has the nicest staff,give good sized portions and everything tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Hard to eat a salad with a spoon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was nearly warm,Ripped the tortilla for the burrito ,and they didn't have any chicken for my salad,and they had new chicken made for the person behind me,I had to ask for chicken to be put in my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So for me Chipotle has always been kind of like the Subway of Mexican food,fast Mexican food,The food was ok,I was yelled at by an employee because my child accidentally spilled their food on the patio ,So I'm thinking that next time I'm craving Mexican food- I'll just go to Moe's,the girl taking our order went to get plain rice for my kids' quesadilla combos,"I'm not sure if she was triggered by my kids' request for ""plain rice","They have the best salad called ""The Close Talker",although a bit spicy for my kids' taste,""" or of my explanation of how cilantro tastes like soap to some people",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5 Stars for a great lunch offering with delicious food,I really like the quality of the food , I really like being able to customize burrito ,I typically get the chicken burrito bowl ,and I load it with some rice,beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food cart aren't too far from this spot,couldn't tell the pork from the chicken,from the beans either,They could've had all the meats and beans boiling in 1 pot for all I know,Remember when Chipotle would give you a full spoon of protein or guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tables were covered in food,First trip there the people making the burrito had no clue how to make a burrito,Not how a burrito is supposed to work,At least the burrito was built right this time, My wife loves burritos,next bite all rice,The rice was undercooked,The rice was still hard,and rice,Again with the hard rice,It's extremely hard to OVERCOOK rice,next bite all beans,Next trip there they had run out of the beans I wanted,as were the beans,screw you for taking bacon out of your beans to p,And now your brown beans suck,next bite all meat,the meat I wanted,Last trip my meat was cold,and guacamole,next bite all cheese,One bite all sour cream,The sour cream looked like liquid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
manager is just as awful as their food if i was corporate,worst chipotle in the damn world,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Still a good salad and the quality from chipotle that I expect,I was only sad because my side of salsa was left out of my bag so I didn't have it ,The crew member was heavy handed with the meat which I appreciated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because that's the most important part of my veggie bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lol they totally messed up my burrito,I like chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food quality comparable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle Ive been to,everytime I go they give me the tiniest portion of meat,I ordered delivery double meat today ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,Our table had remnants of food from previous,We had to get napkins and clean the table The staff is efficient behind the counter where food is prepared    The biggest concern is I had to use the men's restroom,and reasonably priced,Bag of chips sold separately are very salty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is a place where you can get burritos,burrito bowls,and tacos,especially since all the ingredients are all natural, and also good quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I paid $36 for my two adult bowls ,and a kids bowl ,They ran out of lettuce, What mexican place runs out of lettuce,for Chipotle has a good taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ALL got food poisoning the following,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
found plastic in my guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had a really good burrito with chicken in it,definitely worth the price ,but chips would've been nic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but refuse to use because of reasons just like this one are the only option for getting food,#2) This Chipolte will NOT call you to let you know that your order is not being picked up and that they are closing so now you've bought and paid for burritos for their employees to take home,and you didn't even get to pick and choose who you want to give those burritos to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after getting my food,my eye directly landed on the girl in the food area cutting up steak on the red,Who wants to eat food from a place that should be 5 STARS from someone that's cutting up food not sanitary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location is constantly out of food for basic,or rice,cheese, meals like lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Need more chipotles managed like this one ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,Our table had remnants of food from previous,We had to get napkins and clean the table The staff is efficient behind the counter where food is prepared    The biggest concern is I had to use the men's restroom,and reasonably priced,Bag of chips sold separately are very salty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They are so unbelievably stingy with the food,The bottom of my bowl wasn't even fully covered with food, I told her the food is getting lighter , This is unfortunate because I really like their food overall,25 for a bowl you could like a little more than half a scoop or rice ,and half a scoop or beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The kid working there said we ran out of meat ,and salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and price is fair,good taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I don't know what they put in these burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think the food had been sitting out for a while,Got a chicken burrito ,the burrito was really subpar,and they were out of many of the ingredients on the line ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(Picture uploaded) Never really had such a small bowl from any chipotle,While the guy was making our order I had to ask him twice to put in some more rice in the same,he had to ask the guy next to him if he can put more rice in the bowl,All three bowls were almost half full with barely any meat or rice in there,After waiting for 15 minutes in line with 5 other customers I finally got a chance to order 3 to go bowls, bowl because there wasnt really anything in any of them,Asked him for beans on all 3 bowls ,but he clearly ignored it and moved the bowls out of his way like he was too busy,He puts in almost a half spoon full of chicken in each bowl,The other person asked if i wanted meat i said yes chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a barbacoa burrito, Ate about 3/4 of the burrito before biting down on a small,A small rock was in my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Make sure you pay attention to how they make your food because it's basically an assembly line that moves TOO fast,So they might not put enough food or put the right, meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I regularly eat food from Chipotle ,and I love the food,Every time I come in the staff has been rude and they either take forever to make your food or rush you through the line rolling their eyes if you ask for anything more then what they give you,Also forget being sanitary- the staff filling up the food trays wasn't wearing gloves after stating mins before that he was going to the restroom,I even found a hair in my food tonight,I have never been to this location and been satisfied with a burrito,I am fed up with waiting around to deal with rude staff that can't even make my burrito taste like it should,50% of the time the rice you get has not been mixed well ,My online orders have been wrong every time- you would think it would be simpler looking off a online order form to make a bowl,"Other staff quickly apologized for their colleagues attitudes and frequently will offer ""free"" drinks/chips/guac to make up for other",90% of the time they are out of at least one or two ingredients because they have not been made ,This is by far the WORST quality location I have yet to go to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So frustrated- ordered 3 tacos-,barley any meat after my wife ordered a bowl with triple the amount of meat - same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got on here because the staff is always so sweet and accommodating to me and my burrito bowls are stacked,For the price,One day my bowl will just have a little,Only thing stopping it from being 5 stars for me is that I've noticed the salsas aren't consistent,you don't want to omit the salsa,Since there's no other sauces besides sour cream,being open until 10pm and having fresher ingredients than the nearby,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Normally love the burrito bowls with guacamole, However today they had a the grossest brown guacamole, When I asked if they had fresher guacamole they said no this ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ew they give u literally nothing I asked for extra corn once ,and they gave me three individual pieces of corn,Then another lady was like extra corn is fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were out of avocados and white rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In my old town out of state I'd do chipotle 3-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also dropped food in other,food so it mixed,The employees all seemed out of it and made multiple mistakes as we were ordering including telling us there was no more white rice ,the rice was brought out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a chicken burrito bowl with all of the fixings with a side of chips ,The service was good and I was very satisfied with my chicken burrito bowl,I had to ask for more chicken because they always try to be skimpy,The server ended up adding about five more pieces of chicken,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the stingiest (food wise) Chipotle's in Boston,I counted the small dusting of chicken on top of my food , The workers act like they bought the food ,but they already charge more than any other Chipotle cause they are downtown but give less food,The food did taste good ,Chipotle is a good burrito place, I get the burrito bowl to cut down on all the calories,  White rice or brown,rice,"""Brown rice"" ",and she proceeds to give me half a scoop of brown rice, Then the next lady (I don't see why we need a person to serve rice ," I say ""Black beans"" but after seeing the rice", It's rice,  Then they ask if I want chicken whi,ch I  say yes and i get (11 small pieces) of chicken,they cut up the chicken into small,grilled chicken , Then the next lady (I don't see why we need a person to serve  and another to serve beans ,and veggies) asks what type of beans I want," I say ""Black beans"" ",I ask for extra black beans, She looks at me with this weird condescending look and reluctantly adds a small scoop of beans then a dash of extra,beans,just poked the tip of the spoon in the tub and pulled out like 6 more beans to add on,and beans, Some salsa ,and corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is also my first chipotle ever that has been stingy with the ingredients,Ok I thought maybe it was just my taste buds but the chips here are soooooooo,The cashier was rude every time I asked for a side item such as guacamole or dressing she got annoyed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is conveniently located in the Perimeter Mall food court ,I would definitely stop by the food court for my usual,They gave me what I needed: a chicken burrito bowl with some good, burrito bowl,What's annoying to me is the constantly rising prices,my taste buds did not lead me astray,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However it is SO disappointing to find out that they FORGOT to put guacamole in my veggie bowl after making it all the way home,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hungry for the bowls I ordered three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for guacamole and got half of a hard avocado on my bowl instead,I've had three veggie bowls,come without it entirely and the guacamole is basically the main component of a veggie bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered 3 rice bowls carried out, When we got home the rice was raw, This isn't the first time the rice or beans have been undercooked,but this time the rice was not edible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This isn't a complaint about the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Barely any rice or protein for the amount of toppings on it,Ordered a lifestyle bowl that came with all my favorite,pinto beans,sour cream,I spent the rest of the meal adding more sour cream,toppings like corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the staff is really friendly - much more so than you would typically get at a ""faster"" food restaurant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the quacamole portions were super tiny for the price ,When I got home to eat it there was hardly any rice so the sauces made a soup at the bottom ,Today I went and ordered a steak bowl ,We have had to return items because the steak and chicken was raw,and then the scoop of meat becomes smaller ,and the steak was so well done it was almost unedible,Unfortunately they are very inconsistent with their quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tried it again and the food has really dropped off,This was it for me and chipotle,Missing ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think the peppers and onions are huge part of the bowls ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food,Also the food is always hot,the food did not have that fresh,Bottom line is food wasn't fresh,I ordered the chicken bowl and my son and his friend had the barbacoa burrito,This was my sons friend first time eating at a Chipotle so we were somewhat excited to introduce him to a great place for an overstuffed burrito,He had the barbacoa burrito,I just asked my son what he thought of his burrito ,"and his response was "" pretty small burrito",and portions for the price paid were not what I usually receive from other,For the price Taco Bell would have been a better choice,I ended up getting the chicken bowl,The final product was added and the ingredients didn't even reach the rim of the bowl,All of the container were do low with contents that I couldn't see the ingredients from the other,The young man behind the counter wasn't putting enough ingredients on the tortilla so I mentioned that he was being a little,Now if I didn't know what is usually the standard I may have been okay with the amount of ingredients,Not only were the amount of ingredients not the usual,The kid could have so easily just added more ingredients, did not have that fresh taste that keeps me coming back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food just wasn't up to par the carnitas were not great,Wanted to check out a chipotle that my family , I wouldn't expect a great chipotle meal at this location, The chips we ordered were full,and the portion size for the meat was small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went here tonight around 7 PM and the line was very long which is usually expected going to chipotle,"By the time she was finished with my bowl she said to her coworker ""I might get fired tonight"" as if she was implying she was about to flip out","She was getting so impatient with me when I couldn't hear what she was mumbling asking and talking about me to her coworker right in front of me saying ""I asked her if she wanted lettuce"" rolling her eyes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and would have to take a ride share to the location for the replacement food--another $15-,the order was of one of the items I had deleted--a burrito, She kept telling me I ordered a burrito, I took the burrito back to the unpleasant,I managed to delete the unwanted items and place my order for 3 tacos,when I told her that I had ordered tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great customer service and great food at this location,3 hard shell tacos with chicken ,My best friend was craving chipotle ,and we were on a tight schedule so he sent me to chipotle to get him a meal,Keep up the great work chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't want someone like that making my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Absolutely LOVE chipotle,Charged me extra for guacamole just to get home & realize it's just half an avocado that's so hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also forgot guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but we didn't wait much longer than 5 minutes total for our delicious food,her first time ever in a chipotle,who was putting our meats and beans together was amazing,he told her all the items going down the line that had them (corn salsa ,and guacamole were two big,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food at this location of awful, Also it tasted like just loads of salt on old food, The chicken was not flavored, The vegetables tasted soggy ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I swear they must purposely put as little food as possible,I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and this is coming from someone who dreams about Chipotle burritos,They gave the PUNIEST burrito ever,since another one was taking LITERALLY 5 minutes to carefully stuff that other lady's 3 tacos,and i love chipotle :,Good: Your typical ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The workers never bothered to tell me that they were out of salad dressing until I'm at the register paying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- my child doesn't eat them and there's no point in wasting food,Our order is: white rice,and half chicken ,half black and pinto beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They weren't going to be switched out any time soon which seemed like a great way to cause a food borne,Overall poor management and a lack of food safety,and rice just sitting on the counter behind the line,Not to mention the fact that there were 6 containers full of chicken,steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was very salty,Used the Chipotle app for the first time to order one of their new Whole30 salad bowls with carne,and the meat was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how are you out of guacamole at 8pm,out of corn,prep more ingredients it's your job,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two burritos is what we got,And the chick that wrapped my burrito must have been new,I could help but giggle as she folded my burrito into the middle,Two stars for the burrito,I've been to A LOT of chipotles ,I had like no joke 7 pieces of chicken until I asked for more,Also stop skimping on the ingredients mah dudes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we've noticed both the quality of the food/portions ,I've tried all the entrees here -- burritos,I think the burritos ,The burritos are big,tacos,and tacos are tastier than the bowls,If you order tacos,you get three tacos per order ,and you can choose a different protein/meat for each taco,If you choose a different protein/meat for each taco,if you ordered two chicken tacos ,and a steak taco,When ordering tacos,you get more lettuce in lieu of rice,though you can get rice - ,they're priced by the meat/protein you choose,my default order is a chicken bowl with brown rice (white,rice is also an option),and the quality of ingredients is fair for the price,you'll be charged the price of the highest-priced,you would be charged the steak price ($8,not the chicken price ($6,The portion sizes on the bowls weren't as generous,one of our chicken bowls was downright sad,bowls,Salads are pretty much the same thing as bowls,and  are tastier than the bowls,95 for chicken,if you ordered two chicken  ,50) made from chicken ,black beans (pinto also an option),and pretty much most of the sauces and extras -- fresh tomato salsa,tomatillo red-chili salsa,tomatillo green-chili salsa,roasted chili-corn salsa,and chips and salsa ($2,get one free offer (entrees) and free chips ,It's mainly just chips ,chips ,We've gotten stale chips before, meat,I really like Chipotle's chorizo and it might be my favorite of their meats,00 for steak ,and Monterey Jack shredded cheese,They also have a kids menu with a cheese quesadilla ($3,sour cream,and I often ask for the sour cream on the side,romaine lettuce,the new shopping center at the corner of Northside Drive ,you also have the choice of crispy corn tortillas or soft,and salads,in a salad,"and technically anything else - in your ""salad",the ingredients are just different,the ingredients are fresh,The guac is delicious
Thanks chipotle for another reason along with heath department reasons why we won't be back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plus the chips were extremely stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hopefully zazby's across the street will TRY to get us food,This is by far the worst chipotle I've ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's very packed and the quantity and quality did not change,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" With 1 eyebrow up My wife just nod and let it go but when I was in the cashier with my sister he was askin if chicken or beef I answered chicken ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I frequent this chipotle so I thought it was time I write a review,The staff is always friendly and they're never stingy on the ingredients (like some locations tend to be),quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My mom order a quesadilla and they are rushing once again and she didn't let my mom food melt fully,Plus the roller have guacamole on her gloves and it was all over my burrito ,My best friend never had chipotle she had a okay,I have to say i am very disappoint because i love chipotle , As my friend as about the rice ,Like what if i was allergic to guacamole,We both didn't order it guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only thing this store has going for it is good quality food,I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food quality that I have checked out ,for a decent price and the food is steady,after years of buying two to three times weekly burritos for lunch or dinner at a local,50 for a big stuffed burrito with home made chips ,80 for a burrito with measured,it's not the best burrito I've ever had- ,and I am not going to pay one and 1/2 times for 1/3 less burrito (with measured ingredients- which this huge,but it's a damn good one for the price,like no hormones of any kind in their chicken,counted out and one small salsa- not pico,I got 4 single chips,And they don't count my chips,and I'm not sure what standards the steak goes by,I started coming to Chipotle once I had verified that they did use good ingredients,ingredients at 1/3 less the size and, Mexican Cafe not too far away- and having their quality go down,and the fact that it is all fresh and it's not overly salted or loaded with fat just to make it taste better was really one of the things that put me over the top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is tasty,I enjoy being able to eat Chipotle on just about every corner in Austin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were serving half spoon fulls of rice and beans to try to ration what was left to get through the line rather then just make more or tell people they are out of food,utensils on the floor and food all over the place,i love chipotle,but this is hands down the worst chipotle ive,After they ran out of rice,they still weren't informing customers (who waited close to 30 minutes) that they were out of their main ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and she recently order a burrito with sofrita,they gave her chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered tacos which led to them putting the lid,filled my tacos, down on the counter collecting beans ,and then took a bite of corn that was left over on my plate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I couldn't enjoy my food bc I kept thinking how unclean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Obviously these college kids don't know how to handle the food here properly,I have had food poisoning for 4 days straight ,I ordered online and understand there is a line food station ,obviously the food at the mobile,order station had gone bad because it's not eaten as fast at the line food station,I have ate chipotle for 4 years,chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but what I know is that my food was fresh,I got the veggie bowl today that includes guacamole,There was a large piece of unripened avocado in my bowl that I chewed on,salsa ,She gave me free chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the first food preparer had to go through five wheat burrito wraps -- ripping or tearing the first,My food did taste good ,I'd felt underwhelmed at the options as I'd looked over the menu while in line waiting because the only option seemed to be seared-and-stir-fried vegetables as a burrito or bowl,"and having ""elected"" to have the vegetable burrito",and a few of the additional fixings that would make the burrito appetizing,I'd then gone through the Moe's-like process of which rice (brown),what beans,including their spiciest (but to me relatively-spicy-tasting) salsa blend that had ended up burning my lips as I'd found over the next,It might be because my option was meatless,It always had disappointed me when I'd heard Chipotle charges a premium on the guacamole,I'd gotten no guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe they're trying to make up for the money they lost in that food contamination crisis they had a while back,The food tastes better at Cabo Bob's ,and also seems fresher plus they always pack your food with plenty of protein,I stopped in this chipotle for a late,I ordered a chicken bowl with brown rice,It seemed like every spoonful I was eating was mostly rice,Has the price of chicken gone up overnight,As fkr tge bowl,I mean it was very hard finding any chicken in my bowl,I don't think there was more than 2 oz of chicken in my entire bowl,All I know is for $12 and change they should've put a helluva lot more chicken in my bowl,I have to say I was surprised by how little chicken they actually put in it,black beans ,beans ,and all the veggies and some chips & queso,First off the chips were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've stopped by in between work and being around the city and every occasion the food has been fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I preferred drive the other chipotle that is far from me than go to this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100/100 best food artist ever, Never before has my bowl been prepared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They didn't have plain tomatoes and there were onions in the sour cream,The lady whipped the onions into the sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They then made my food ,the rice was very crunchy,and put noticeable smaller proportions in my bowl,I was talking to a friend about how I was upset because they didn't have black beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My boyfriend's burritos are always huge,and I usually get a burrito bowl ,The prices are fair,The ingredients are evenly portioned - I find that a lot of places dish out rice overload,brown rice,I usually get chicken,black beans,lettuce and corn salsa,The slight spiciness of the corn salsa is delicious,It's a bummer that the guacamole isn't good,Theirs is watery and tastes as if it were days old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The kids meals come with rice ,and beans,The cheese still looked liked,shredded cheese never heated,add more cheese ,Then as we were leaving my daughter reminded me she wanted sour cream,Then she proceeded to just walk around in the back for a while then finally get the sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My only complaint here was that my burrito was wrapped a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's a TON of other taco/burrito options here,I love chipotle,but this one has made me stay away from chipotle in general,Which is a shame because I use to give chipotle my business everyday in Florida,I want chipotle back,I worked for chipotle,Sorry chipotle,I won't be returning to another chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like this location a lot more than the one I used to go to around the corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is an absolute rarity (I get the white and brown rice combined in my burrito bowl),Also kudos to whoever cooked the brown rice the day I ate here as it was so tender,it actually tasted better than the white rice,everything tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
over all good but the rice had no cilantro,and tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered online it said it would be ready at 4:45 I got there at 4:47 and my food is ice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time we go into chipotle & Tanner is working it's always our most enjoyable,This chipotle wouldn't be the same,He is so thoughtful & he takes his time every time to ensure the quality of each meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the smallest chipotle I've been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay I just love chipotle in general,but every time I have ordered at this chipotle I am so pleased,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pros:  The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2) I can stick to my Paleo plan and order a salad bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of those chipotle locations that gives you half a scoop of everything ,and like 5 chips so you're paying $12 for a snack,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always hot and fresh food,Best chipotle in Orl,Sometimes you just want salad and you love chipotle,Once I asked salad bowl (no rice,You want double pinto beans,"No one even ask me why I skip meats,beans ",no meat) just with tomatoes ,and guacamole +,extra lettuce on top,Double corn,Unfortunately they don't have salad in menu,You can make your own salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a veggie bowl,Threw off the flavor of the bowl big,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
once someone's burrito bowl was in my bag (filled w toppings my daughter doesn't like) ,Every time I come to this chipotle I have a problem,and my daughter's bowl was missing,I have argued w the manager bc one time around 1130am I went in to get a bowl ,My daughter ordered chips ,I ordered guacamole and chips which I got free, The girl ringing me out took my free birthday chips ,So then she rang me up for the guacamole and chips ,and guacamole ,and took it upon herself to assume I was substituting my guacamole w queso,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last week we came in and they had no white rice ,tonight no black beans ,and we had to wait for steak because nobody had made any to reload the bar,This used to be a five star Chipotle but the last 6 months the quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food doesn't have salt,there is no flavor to the food,"which I think ""Mexican"" food has lots of flavor","services has gotten slow(not on Rush our) every time I stop by they are out of some thing (steak,chicken",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food order description was correct,Here's your food  ) never seen Jason ,Left the previous food that was made incorrectly ,and drive back home to eat my new cold food which I guess was made right after I called ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was our first visit to Chipotle and both my husband and I wanted salads,We both went through the entire order/assembly process just to get to the cashier at the end of the line and were told they didn't have any more salad dressing/vinaigrette,If you're making customers salads,Once he was informed of the situation he told us we could have the salads for free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle ,They skimp on the meat so be prepared to have no substance to your meals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went to chipotle at peak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sitting down to enjoy my food in under 5 minutes,getting my burrito bowl just how I wanted,The only down part was that the mild salsa was pretty darned,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I had a large turkey breast left over so I decided to get a veggie bowl since this only needed the add-ons (,44 it comes with all the fixings plus guacamole gets added on with no extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then she had to have my husbands burrito rewrapped which in turn made it lose quite a few,Sadly been disappointed by my favorite chipotle,When you pay 2 extra dollars for guac please actually put an amount worth 2 dollars on the bowl,"And when you almost drop all the guac off and the bowl don't say ""saved it"" just professionally move on",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle I've ever been to,Not sure how you can mess up a chicken quesadilla ,Additionally they didn't even seem to have the chicken made correctly,The guy tried to give me a quesadilla with no cheese and the meat just placed in the center of the wrap,it tasted awful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice wasn't cooked ,The steak tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In such a busy food court,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gives very small portions in comparison to other chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this chipotle managed to consistently under-deliver,The first warning - he scooped out my rice - ,and it was barely enough to fit the corner of the bowl,and dumped beans in to the empty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went to this chipotle ,Actually give you a good amount of meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We find that the Chipotle at the Millenia Mall has much better food quality,18: We had a couple of bowls from this location, The bowl was OK,I had the double meat (steak),The meat definitely didn't taste very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Get that red head kid that doesn't know how to shave behind the counter the fuck out of there he doesn't know how to rap a burrito even tho that fuck was soooooo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The pinto beans tasted like bad water and brown rice was hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I legit order like 3 times a week from chipotle,this Sunday 11/17  I was sick and couldn't even get out of bed to cook for my kids and y'all decide to forget their Apple juice and chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know it's not homemade mexican food from a family run Mexican joint,this blows away boloco and will be a staple of my diet going forward (considering how sparse the food options are in the evenings ,I'd go so far to say that Chipotle is one of the better options around if you need to get your burrito fix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best chipotle in Portland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The order was wrong the food was cold, and the chips was salted,Not sure what that thing was they call cheese dip ,but that wasn't cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It's the closest to us and so we order from here a lot because we love the food, One of the burritos was so poorly wrapped that it was falling apart, Tonight's had only the chicken in it ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(Also the food is always yummy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love it with all my burrito-deprived heart,precious burrito,Not only was it out of several ingredients (though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The people  making your food give you an attitude ,The manager should not hire people who get attitues with customers when asking for their food to be correct,telling you what I  want and you  still put whatever you want on my burrito bowl,guacamole  section  has an attitude  ,Had to get my topping on the side because the girl working th me cheese,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the steak bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sooo this is what it looks like when you order online and pay $20 for half ass burritos,Take your $ elsewhere the difference in size unbelievable and for paying about $8-10 per burrito this is honestly a rip off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food could be warmer too,This location is the closest one to my house so it's super convenient when I'm craving a bowl for my weekly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was one employee eating food in the middle of the dining room as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I noticed I would have liked a bit more cheese on top of the tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Second time coming to this location in the past two days because the food is delicious,Today I'm assuming he was extra upset as he slammed my burrito down onto my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle's customer service has really taken a nosedive since that whole food poisoning saga -- such,If you want burritos ,and burrito bowls,Today they were also missing chicken,guacamole was one of the missing items,the Laughing Planet Cafe is two blocks up the road -- they always have guacamole ,last time it was lettuce too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was very disappointed that I had to feed the rice to my daughter during this time,There was also a hair on my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They give you the smallest amount of food possible,The place is also dirty (dirty right after opening) and the people serving the food are awful,A scoop of food is not 2 pieces of chicken or a tiny,I decided to go back and this is how they fold burritos,I think it's part taco no,It always is a battle to communicate if it's mild or medium salsa I would like, bite of salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm standing in line ordering my food ,They use lime in half the food,the same woman went ahead and put a crap tone of cilantro on my food ,I don't come to this chipotle often,It's chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I decided not to get the food I just walked away ,and went to another chipotle the one by Posner and they gave me the same order but the amount of food was completely different,I do love chipotle so much ,the quantity was so small not like the other chipotle ,Since I lovechipotle so much,I DO NOT RECOMMEND this chipotle at all,the prices are higher ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Horrible experience for such a new looking chipotle I had to order double,meat to get the normal amount of meat I would at any other chipotle slow ,If this has been my first experience with chipotle I would never go back to one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went to Chipotle and got a brown rice bowl,Halfway through ordering I realized I wasn't going to finish my bowl ,She also charged me for a bag of chips ,She took the chips off ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is not that hard to prepare the food ,I definitely recommend you driving to a different chipotle,This chipotle should have never opened,Good luck with your two grains of rice because that's all they're going to really put in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But then I got my food which was cross contaminated with other,I found numerous chunks of avocado peel in the guacamole and found what looked like a bug in my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is consistently good,The food is fresh,but for just good food,I almost always get the burritos,I started asking them to put a handful of the greens in my burrito at the very start of the line,changes the entire taste of the burrito ,Since I could eat burritos 7 days a week,before your choice of rice,so I stick with the 'mild' salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is not good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I work night shifts and yesterday me and 4 other coworkers got food to go, The employee definitely had to be mad about it bc what I got was basically the equivalent of someone spitting in your burger (thank god there's just a glass partition separating you and your food as it's been made,) My food was drenched in the rojo salsa,I'll be sure to order my food with several, Never even considered that salsa to even be spicy, All I could taste was the red salsa, I know how it should taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the recent scare of food poisoning/,the lines are hella short at the lunch rush due to people not trusting the quality of the food,I have to microwave my burritos,but at least the cheese melts inside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've gotten food here so many,Got uber eats today and i opened the burrito bowl to find the entire, thing covered in BLACK guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always try to go to a different chipotle than this one,All chipotle's I go to always give a good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were out of just about everything and literally filled my bowl with food scrapped from the bottom of the container,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They were preparing orders in a small space in the corner ,Onions on my salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Girl pulls a bowl after I tell her what I want,then right as I think I'm about to get good service she asks the guy what he would like and what he'd like on his bowl,she slides my bowl away from her ,stingy with the helpings (even the guacamole that you pay extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got tacos, 3 tacos with just a small, This is a taco,30 for guac on a taco , dusting of chicken at the bottom ,and then 3/4 filled with lettuce and salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ordered a veggie burrito bowl with normal,this shit shows up in a pool of sour cream with a side of rice & toppings,  amount of sour cream selected,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What a headache just trying to get the food I ordered,They really got one piece of lettuce in my whole burrito bowl ,I usually opt for free birds and thought I want some chipotle this time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually take my food to go anyways,If I find it busy and I want to sit then I'll just take my food next,door in the City Place food court with a bunch of tables ,chicken bowl with brown rice,and cheese,lettuce,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I have given this location several chances and the food is horrible,and the food is just not good,but this location should be closed until management can teach the employees how to prepare the food, The beans are watery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20 years of eating Chipotle and this is by far the worst burrito I've ever had at one,Go to ANY OTHER CHIPOTLE until they revamp whatever mess is causing this poor excuse for a burrito,Stale rice,super strong onion flavor to the salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i feel like they are giving me less food,Here the food is always fresh,including design your own burritos,tacos ,I have had my regular bowl of brown rice with chicken at this Chipotle's location several,and bowls, and delicious,A quality stop for a quick,The taste is legendary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's not the food,their food is just as on point as every other,Their food is still on par with other,The Tabasco chipotle sauce is a must have for any burrito or bowl,It's better than their usual steak ,Their ingredients are always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've ordered chips n' guac on the app,only to show up and be told they're out of chips , And in what world does a drink replace chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two burritos is what we got,And the chick that wrapped my burrito must have been new,I could help but giggle as she folded my burrito into the middle,Two stars for the burrito,The cherry on top is that there was a whole half of an avocado that was not ripe that took up at 80% of the guacamole in my burrito,I pulled it out after sinking my teeth into it not realizing it was there and walked up the counter and said hey no big deal but can I get a scoop so I can actually have guac on my burrito ,I've been to A LOT of chipotles ,I had like no joke 7 pieces of chicken until I asked for more,Also stop skimping on the ingredients mah dudes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I am craving Mexican food ,and  need food fast I head here, I get in line and proceed down the line up of food choices as the guy/gal behind the food bar builds a meal designed specific, On my most recent visit I ordered a romaine salad and added chicken (very nicely seasoned/marinated) pinto beans,and the salsa with corn,jack cheese, to my taste buds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but all of the one in the food prep,We like chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today it was 20 minutes after the selected pick up time that I received my two salads and a bag of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eventually the food arrived at 8pm,The restaurant actually sent the food that had been waiting since just after 6pm,all of the food was room temp,and the chips were stale,the guacamole was brown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The guacamole is not made the same as the awesome chipotle in Beaverton, One employee couldn't explain what the super green salad was and we asked what kind of chicken they cooked if it was dark, Your chips are too staled with not enough, or white meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was my food from chipotle,those chips and cheese are not from chipotle that's from Moe's but I decided to do a combination of chipotle and Moe's it actually taste really good but that kind of green and meat color is chipotle and it tasted pretty good I like to go to chipotle because their food is delicious,Sometimes I'm not in the mood for chipotle ,Like the chips ,That is why I get most chips ,but not the cheese,and cheese because that taste deliciou,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm praying that they didn't cook food left in the fridge while the power was out during the storm,I ordered the chicken bowl with brown rice,As soon as I finished the bowl,Black beans,veggies and my usual toppings plus a side of guacamole and chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All I got was one tiny scoop and the whole bowl just felt dry,The steak meat was hard,I asked for extra sour cream on both orders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Live around the corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality was bad,I feel so worry for the business and the quality of the food,unless it change the general manager and the quality of the food the service,my young daughter told me the rice tasted,The host Stacy had very bad attitude and charged wrong with our kids meal price ,They burn the kids cheese quesadilla ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The line was extremely long upon entrance and the staff failed to replenish the food items in circulation ,No one was making sure the food running out was being made it was a total,I get my food,I get home to enjoy my food ,I've been to a lot of chipotles ,but this has to be one of the worst experience I ever encountered and I probably won't go back to this chipotle,I waited almost 20 minutes for beans and rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The least they could have offered for the long waits is some chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean food is slapped together,Best part is I know no one from chipotle even cares,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another day another badly made bowl,This is literally the 6th time that I have ordered double chicken bowl to go ,and they forgot to add the double chicken,25 to not get my chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They give you the smallest amount of food possible,The place is also dirty (dirty right after opening) and the people serving the food are awful,A scoop of food is not 2 pieces of chicken or a tiny,It always is a battle to communicate if it's mild or medium salsa I would like, bite of salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I normally go to this chipotle all the time,but it tasted like they just dumped salt on top of my chipotle bowl,I've never had a worse chipotle bowl or experience like thi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you would think they would try to serve good quality food,For chipotle to have a tainted,thought it was ok to sell old brown and dark green guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff was very welcoming and the food was excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can't speak about the food,We walked up to the counter because we just wanted chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the best chipotle in the area by far,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They made it enjoyable to order my food,while ordering our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm very disappointed in my order from chipotle today I originally ordered through Uber eats ,and had to drive all the way to the store to have a new bowl made for me without guacamole,The guacamole they put on my bowl is clearly spoiled,The entire bowl is so salty,I let every staff on the line know how horrid it tastes ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
every time i come here i order ahead it says my food is ready,i get there and my food takes another 35 min avg,it's meat and rice bruh not har,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm a delivery driver and they NEVER have food ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went with the new carne asada with white rice,I managed to eat half of the bowl ,black beans,salsa ,and extra cheese plus sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am a huge fan of chipotle,Also the fajitas were so over burnt that they ruined the entire flavor of the bowl,The corn has been frozen every single time I've eaten here and they haven't had guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Homeboy gave me half a scoop of chicken so I asked how much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ordered a chicken over salad with guac and the carne asada burrito ,Now I remember why I don't get burritos,I specifically wanted to taste the carne asada so I ripped open  the burrito in the center,The rice ,and beans are not proportional,The chips were stale, to the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food,This really is the worst chipotle around,I don't know why this particular chipotle is always so behind ,is pretty on par with typical chipotle so at least there's that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I come here often - love those salads ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food like  always ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Chipotle food scraps were all over the tables ,I went into this Chipotle location to get a veggie bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I order my food,I love chipotle,"I went there just after my birthday with a ""free chips and guac"" code on the chipotle app",Scan my free chips and guac code before paying like I have at any other chipotle,I scan my code for free chips ,Then she asks me if I want to add more chips ,I pay and then stand there awkwardly waiting for her to hand me the chips ,saying I didn't want chips ,"""I scanned the free chips ","shoves it right in my face and says ""look there's no chips ",after being told and shown you have perceived that the problem is that she did not put the chips ,The manager throws chips on the counter ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was trying  to buy some food thier like i did before during these tough,I can't  believe  in this time in our life that people will refuse you to eat food a necessary,I will never go to a chipotle  ever again as i was so humiliated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food flung all over every surface,Welp this is still the worst chipotle in all of Texas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Average chipotle here ,Food quality is average as is the usual chipotle,I'll be back if I'm craving chipotle if I'm nearby,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They just slap the food in the container,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Would highly recommend this location fresh food super, friendly workers frequent this chipotle about once a week ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stay away from the brown guacamole,lettuce and sour cream unless you don't mind spending the night on the toilet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a burrito bowl ,and in return I got a burrito cup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*Do you want some hair with your food,One of the front male employees that is preparing the food during lunch time has so much,It is disgusting to see a big tuft of hair just hanging over the food he is preparing for customers,Who knows how much hair this kids had shedded in peoples food,I said then he should wear a hair net or go preform a job that doesn't require him to handle food with all that hair,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EDIT: after 35 minutes AFTER my pickup time I was given cold food with brown,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service was fast and the food was very delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will not be purchasing food from this location ever again,The burritos just keep getting smaller ,As you can see in the photo the burrito is less than 4 inches long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In these times of a pandemic it's just crazy how these employees at this particular chipotle are breathing directly over fresh food going into your plate or burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I ordered a steak Burrito bowl which was yummylicious, She asked if there was salsa without cilantro,they promptly reached underneath the counter and generated a cup of salsa without the cilantro,my wife cannot stand the taste of cilantro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The rice was undercooked (way too many,Also ordered extra corn salsa ,But the worse was that they did not include one of the side order of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tastes great,"(I am suddenly reminded of that old light beer commercial with ""less filling"" and ""tastes great",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no chicken,and the chips ,chips are stale,I paid for double meat,get home to eat and I'm missing meat all together, and guacamole is brown,and Guacamole I paid extra for taste like they are from 3 days ago,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they forgot half of our food so it was a little,the food did not taste good, (couldn't even tell it was chipotle),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another they mixed up the ingredients in the two bowls I ordered,Their order quality could use some work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was a funky smell today: think wet-dog meets spoiled seafood,But they food prep was rushing the order that he didn't ask about lettuce,For food they get one star,I love chipotle,After visiting the newer chipotle on Riverside last,I admire chipotle , week I was craving another bowl today,guacamole or salsa,I had to ask him for salsa ,I didn't even bother with the lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can watch the food being cooked right there,The burritos are always packed big and tight with tons of food,Great quick bite and quality food,I got the carne asada salad and the same as a burrito,Nothing beats a chipotle meal,Download the chipotle app,The meat is so tender,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank you chipotle for randomly doing only online orders and messing up food orders as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a steak burrito ,Always have loved chipotle ,I did order LIGHT salsa ,and my regular add-on's and I took on bite and got a mouthful of lettuce which I didnt order,I opened it up to pull the lettuce out ,and found corn which i didnt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I show up at 3:30 and the line was very long and my food wasn't ready,I have worked in the food industry for the last,I ordered a single single burrito on the app yesterday at 3 PM ,As I approach the register to pay I told the man that I was still waiting for a burrito from my mobile,I will not be coming back to this chipotle until they fix their management,I waited another 20 minutes and still nothing so I decided to get in line and order some chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I find that your serving sizes always depend on the time of day and whoever is serving up the food,I find Chipotles to be quite consistent on taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Repeated issues - not planning to eat at any chipotle again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food area was messy,The food was fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food portions are smaller there is barely Any,When you are choosing your toppings that area is Unsanitary they wipe the counter down as the food that was on the counter falls into the food,I haven't been to chipotle in awhile since recently and now I remember why the customer service issue and the food, meat in the bowl or burrito you, ask for a little more they charge u for extra meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
White rice wasn't full cook and it was disappointed because I can't finish whole burrito to continue eat,half hard rice that I wouldn't able,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really wish chipotle would accept card tip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love picking up food here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love their steak bowls ,but for some reason onions always end up in my bowl at this location ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are so chewy and offensive honestly and it's only one big one I didn't order a burrito for a reason,why would I want a big burrito tortilla,I'd prefer some smaller better quality ones so I can actually enjoy it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Today I ordered lifestyle bowl said : carnitas,fresh tomato salsa ,either forgot to my additional side order org ave me meat instead of sofritas,and guacamole,carnitas with spicy sauce and sour cream, It was only iceberg lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everytime we come to this chipotle the serving size is always smaller and this is the first time we have been charged for tortillas with our burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finally asking if they forgot about my food,They put it in the bag with the food falling out onto everything else,They continued to check people out as I stood in the corner,didn't let me add more ingredients to it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have the standard set-up where you walk in and order buffet style and an employee helps get your food,but food is good,The jasmine rice is a personal,I prefer the bowl ,I find the bowl more than filling enough,light sour cream and light salsa,You can get chips and guac or salsa at the end if you want a side,cheese,I like all the different topping options they have and I usually get the corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love the cauliflower rice,excellent choice instead of rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I only ordered a bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
foods consistently fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd drive to the chipotle in Cumberl,and that's 20 minutes away to get some chipotle rather than go to this place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
typically chipotle,for a company as large as chipotle that should be an easy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been able to get what I want - steak burrito bowl,Burrito bowl was salty (I think it was the rice),After a bad instance with getting undercooked chicken at a different,The chips were improperly cooked (transparent,Some fatty pieces of meat,but there were at least 3 times that I tried to order and they were out of steak,I only get steak,The store called me to say there were out of steak after I place my order ,I wish the orders weren't confirmed until they knew they had enough of the ingredients in stock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The restaraunt has an excellent flow from the food prep area/cashier, I was really enamored of the chain and fell in love particularly with the barbacoa burrito ,and burrito bowl,but decided to pick up a burrito to eat at home for dinner,I enjoyed my burrito this evening at home, The tabletops had not been adequately wiped down and bits of lettuce and rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But food is always good,The service at any chipotle is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The guacamole was brown,and the lettuce wasn't fresh,Just not what we expect from such a delicious restaurant that is known for good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(Btw I'm one too) They throw the food together sloppily,the chips are always stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pretty typical experience aside from two things: they hooked it up (my burrito bowl was absolutely packed) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do they taste different,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited for over thirty minutes to pay for my food ,My food was just sitting there cold,and they wanted me to mobile order on their app in order to receive my cold food,I've had bad experience after bad experience at this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Annette told me why don't I make the food at home lol,not because the food ,we just wanted chipotle,I will NEVER go back to this chipotle,This all happened because I bought a kids meal and it didn't come with chips,and Annette just said there are no chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm no foodie so I don't expect too much,The food was slopped together & horribly constructed,but I'd like my cheese shreds to not be foot long strings and my rice to be fully cooked,But holy guacamole this location is a dumpster fire ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I texted the driver and he had the food (thankfully),one burrito was half the size of the other,and one burrito was made incorrectly,This is the worst chipotle I've ever been to,the lid wasn't even secured to the guacamole container,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It's the closest to us and so we order from here a lot because we love the food, One of the burritos was so poorly wrapped that it was falling apart, Tonight's had only the chicken in it ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I walked into chipotle at 8,Very rude staff very unprofessional specially in the time of corona: you cant make people wait for 30 mins in chipotle ,40 today to get a salad bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Something about the fajitas make the food extra, delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anything from burritos,I've seen a few people there sitting outside who could put down a whole burrito or bowl ,Stop by have a nice bowl or burrito ,tacos,Of course this is one of your standard chipotle locations ,and all power to them however usually priced at around $10 a bowl with the price of guac ,They were quite heavy handed on certain salsas ,If you're looking for a place with a whopping side of guacamole this is it,salads ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Review is solely based on online ordering since you pretty much know what to expect food quality wise from chipotle this location in particular,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The fresh ingredients in my husband's pork burrito,daughter's chicken burrito ,and my chicken bowl was perfectly cooked ,and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My husband and grown children enjoyed the burritos,I absolutely love the delicious perfectly cooked chicken plate, The tortilla chips are a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's always a good call to check the food before you leave the store,The food did taste good ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered food to go ,and had to wait an additional 35 minutes for my food,I've been to this chipotle multiple,Other chipotles in the area are much better,They were also out of most of the ingredients I wanted in my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've also asked for them to mix the ingredients before wrapping the burrito (I've done this at other,burrito spots) ,My tip- ask for half black beans/half pinto to get more beans in your bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered delivery from Ubereats and they got both of my orders of burrito ,and burrito bowl wrong,I paid extra to have steak in my burrito ,but got chicken instead ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle I've ever been to,Drive five or 10 minutes to the next closest chipotle ,Tried to charge us twice for chicken that was not in our salad,And finally never melted the cheese in our quesadilla,Asked for salad dressing three times ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they gave me a good amount and it was all ready for me on the shelf by the door plus I order without dairy or meat and didn't random bits in my bowl so that's always a thumbs up (I've had bowls with r,andom pieces of meat ,Not much to say since I ordered mine over the app but it tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was no air on and I was sweating waiting the 30 mins for my food,Our food was cold by the time we finally got it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only did it take half an hour to get our food,I go to chipotle at least once a week ,when there were literally only two people in front of me but I ordered two bowls that's it just the basics no additional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't normally write reviews but the experiences I've had at the sawmill chipotle have been horrible,Sawmill chipotle has lost my busines,This time my rice wasn't cooked all the way ,The quality is never the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they then wrapped my burrito twice ,I ate right outside and my burrito was cold,I love chipotle ,Then they were out of steak ,and tried to make me pay for the more spicer steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 bowls ,The salad toppings such as salsa wasn't drained at all,and 1 salad with carne,Turned into a soup salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gave me a bowl to go the thing was leaking all over my car ,noticed when I got into my car that the chips I ordered with my Guacamole wasn't included,When I went in to remind them of the chips I was given a dirty,look not a word and the girl half threw a bag of chips in my direction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mexican food is closest to Indian,food,Chipotle is my go to food,rice ,Today's lunch - Chipotle's veggie Burrito bowl,and beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lettuce is always wilted,but they never come through or rectify their subpar quality,and the guac tastes ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did not taste fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I visited this location about a month ago and ordered a bowl with grilled, chicken,The woman gave me maybe 5 small pieces of grilled chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no double portion of meat like I requested ,Thanks for the weak dry ass salad today guys,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For the price,I always get the bowl with the steak ,and I usually double the steak as it's definitely worth, They source very fresh ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I love the food cooked fresh, I have a touchy tummy and I have never had a problem with the food at Tucker or any other, I don't have to shop for the food, They put your bowl together per your instructions, It's like a vacation for me in a bowl,hot and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never got food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the staff is always nice and the food is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was a bit bothered when I asked for fresh lettuce ,the lettuce should've been removed ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One time I got home to discover that they forgot to put any of the meat I ordered on my bowl,She just turned around and walked away only to return with a plastic cup with some meat in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Honestly the food should be the bomb,Im standing infront of the bowl and rice guy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Gave me someone else's bowl, no chips (even though i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You'll probably get your food quicker,One person is sometimes making burritos ,Ordered a chicken burrito with no sour, cream and got a tortilla filled with nothing but sour cream and rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It taste like whoever made it dumped the entire packet of salt on my burrito,my last couple of visits to various locations in the city have been subpar lately so maybe the overall quality of the restaurant is going to hell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The tables are not clearly wiped down everytime as I have often seen leftover food on them ,Your bowl would literally look empty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Die hard chipotle fan,Then to top it off my wife got a large hair in her chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My Carne asada burrito was ice cold ,Chronic taco is in the next,and had like 3 pieces of meat,i live around the corner ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the crew member serving the food was disrespectful,There should not be rice and everything else that they serve at chipotle on the bottom of my bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered to go and when I got home and started eating I pulled a piece of a plastic bag or glove (gross) and a short buzzed piece of hair (im a girl) out of my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff is always nice and I just love my burrito bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gave me about half the amount of food I paid for,Easily one of the worst chipotles I've ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place is not good they served me and another customer raw chicken in our tacos,The other customer demanded a refund while I asked to remake my tacos with fully cooked chicken,There are much better taco places in town like la taqueria ,and tacofina,They remade it but my chicken was still too pink,After the raw freezing cold chicken I will not be back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 And I *like* over-salted food,""" stuff like the occasional crunchy rice",* Getting a bowl that is so empty,it doesn't come above the edge of the bowl,* Having bowls assembled extremely messily,beans,and two salsas,fatty meat,or not enough meat,* Being served ice-cold meat,* Being served meat that was so salty,meat,and lettuce and cheese and meat sticking off the edges,cheese,and lettuce and cheese ,lettuce,and lettuce ,* Being served fajita veggies that were charred so badly they tasted like charcoal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went in and customer service wasn't good was rushed to order and then both of my bowls was still messed up I had ask several,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burrito rollers that instead roll a softball and sour cream that's watered down for instance,"This used to be an excellent ""go to"" for lunch but lately the quality has suffered",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Have you ever noticed that when you order a VEGGIE bowl or burito, When you get a meat bowl or meat burito,they don't suggest you or even ask you if you want any guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  Ask about the happy hour deal on margaritas and chips, They will accommodate gluten-free diets by using corn tortillas wrapped in tinfoil to prevent contamination,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really wanted to leave the food there ,The food is very price,The food was very spicy,The burrito was average,one bowl and burrito cost me $23,The bowl was  little,It was full of veggies and sous and very little over-cocked chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We came looking for a place to eat and felt like having Mexican food,They have a location at Metrotown and that one has always been one of my favorite food,I got the steak burrito with almost everything else except anything spicy ,Price is very reasonable,My sister got the same thing but in a bowl ,I prefer the chicken over the steak,and its with chicken,and no guacamole and beans,The only thing that bugged me when walking in was that they ran out of guacamole,How can a Mexican place run out of guacamole,It tasted good,but doesn't have that BBQ taste to it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delicious steak tacos,Tacos just aren't the same without those ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love their rice bowls,They always serve the freshest ingredients ,It's delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As good as the Chipotle in the US but it is obvious that they are greedy when serving the food,especially the meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food that keeps me coming back for more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is consistently good,Their chicken or steak burritos are great,Their chips and salsa are also really good,The chips are thin,The staff is always super friendly and the ingredients are fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Mexican food,I got the crunchy tacos with pulled,delicious and very reasonably priced, I usually get a rice bowl with chicken or some meat with all the fixins, I always get the chips ,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I called on my way from work to this chipotle to place an order (my office is a few,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I heard about this chain and figured it was more a ""cook-'em-up fresh"" restaurant not some ""buffet-style food sitting under heat lamps"" place",it's takeout Tex-Mex food so I think although the burrito was very big,Having said that the burrito I had was delicious,$9 for a burrito,Problem again is it was pricey, (and kind of unmanageable to handle so I ended up basically unwrapping the sucker and dumping it the cardboard bowl they served it in) it could be halved in size along with the price, (but then again I opted not having a dollop of sour cream ,and guac on it so I could actually taste the thing),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Throw some canned beans on a cardboard tortilla from your local,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The large burrito is pretty, Haven't tried the salads ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go to chipotle nearly 2-4,and just had my best chipotle experience here :,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8 out of 10 they put just a little meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or the lid is crushed down: guacamole all over the desk you'd hope to eat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then when I went to order most of the food looked like it's been sitting all day ,I asked for light sour cream and the man working there literally poured about a cup of sour cream all over my veggie bowl,The chips were overly salty too so there's just no way to eat those together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nothing was wrong with my food,I got veggie tacos that were rung up as chicken tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The only difference in food is that the meat has slightly less flavour, It's fast and reasonably priced , and they ran out of the corn salsa , The chips and salsa (mild,salsa was tasteless) had less flavour,  (salt didn't stay on chips, I just hope they speed it up while maintaining the quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of the food is directly correlated with who is working,while the quality (,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If the food line moved at a more moderate,pace our food wouldn't sit ,Now for quality of food,They must be giving out a bonus to whoever can serve the smallest portion of food,I've converted to bowls,And don't bother paying for guacamole - $2,I got THREE pieces of lettuce,"And I'd already requested ""A little more corn please"" so I felt bad",this one is pretty sub-par in terms of both service and quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is good,"My ""healthy"" choice is typically the bowl-less burrito ",The portions of rice,and meat ,It is a shame that you need to pay extra for guacamole,I don't think it has the complexity of guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or burrito,tacos, Brown rice is a healthy,alternative but tastes inferior to the white rice,.bowl, I always shoot for the bowl, Here's why I keep going back:  black beans (awesome),a hint of cheese,sour cream,lots of lettuce,two scoops of their medium corn/jalapeno,salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From the burritos to the quesadillas,and healthy place to enjoy a mic burrito for lunch or dinner,Everything is so delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was bloodshot and sniffling while serving food,they ran out of brown rice,So I had to now wait for the rice to cook,For an overpriced wrap that you wait in line for 15 minutes a a place mainly open,Only after I complained about the meat on my waiting wrap did they offer to remake it,They half made my wrap and the person in front of me waited 5 minutes for the steak to be cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food that was left on the table was simply pushed off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 i got the chicken bowl while my partner picked the veggie burrito with sofrita,not worth the wait when red burrito ,and mucho burrito are both a walk awa,chipotle, the chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food at this one on par with the chain,pretty high quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amazing food,and every time I am enthusiastically greeted and asked if I need any help with food selection,addicting burritos,and my Barbacoa burrito bowl,extra rice,black beans,and some cheese,a liiiiiitle corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get the chicken burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been searching for a yummy burrito since El Taco closed down on Davie street,The guacamole is worth the extra,With no lettuce it's not soggy at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is delicious,The burrito was so poorly made it was falling open and food was dropping out as soon as I pulled a little,Love chipotle,There was a really skimpy amount of chicken because the guy wasn't really looking at what he was doing,The guacamole didn't come off the spoon ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their corner cutting has lost them one (family of 5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To the girl who threw my burrito bowl together,no chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the burrito I receive is poorly built,Often the burrito is poorly wrapped ,Sometimes the burrito is poorly packaged ,Sometimes the ingredients are far out of proportion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Really don't need attitude from someone who spoons rice into a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you like Mexican food at ALL,I could eat their chicken tacos for breakfast,mouth wateringly delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I asked 3 times for lettuce on my bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 8 out of 10 times my chicken quesadilla is not even melted the whole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For the price this is one of the greatest burrito or taco,Just  a great place to grab a healthy burrito ,just ask for less rice ,and chips with awesome,guacamole,it's almost like eating canned ingredients vs,Illegal Petes needs to step up and get better ingredients ,which probably means they care too much about quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
black beans,lettuce,Consistently out of ingredients anytime after 8,there aren't that many ingredients to keep up with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent food I like burrito, bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As for the food,It's not a gourmet meal but it is a burrito that is almost the size of a baby,I go for the veggie burrito (colleague had veggie burrito bowl) ,They were a little chintzy with my cheese and guac and a bit overboard on the black beans (sorry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are barely rolled,This is a very very bad chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I never thought I would have such an unpleasant trip at chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They told me they would make more salad dressing by the time I left for the one I ordered to-go,they skimp on ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food ,I rate it above Tussing rd slightly because food quality seems to be consistently better,never stingy with extra sides or double meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked half and half and they gave me chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burrito came soo soggy and the rice was uncooked,and they gave me like five pieces of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which I waited for because of my love for their burritos,All the ingredients were fresh and my burrito bowl was extremely tasty,I just overlooked my white rice (having ordered the brown) because the line was so long ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They do offer hard or soft shell tacos which are both great,lime flavored chips,Their guacamole is amazing,but this location is hit or miss with how fresh the lettuce is,I typically get a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle's is the closest thing to a Mission burrito for this California transplant,The only thing missing is the grease and grit of a Mission burrito,This is the place to go to when I'm craving a burrito,not a fair comparison since La Taqueria only serves tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was really good,we noticed that they had forgot to put the salsa in our bag,as we had ordered a side of chips and salsa,We went back to the restaurant because we were only across the street to ask for the salsa so we did not have to eat plain,she finally gave us the salsa,I understand that many people may lie about this sort of thing to get extra but it was an honest mistake on Chipotle's part when they forgot to give us salsa , chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got my food rather quickly ,No complaints about the food,delicious at usual,and overall taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 This was after ordering one burrito for the two of us, I was blown away by their gigantic chicken burrito, I guess I'm used to the poor boy burritos from Taco Time, Lots of rice,and your choice of beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after eating here you can stroll fifty feet over to the Dairy Queen and finish filling up on food that ultimately is bad, for you but tastes so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One day I get a good burrito the next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some chipotle ' give you half a buritto,bowl- this one consistently has very generous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you would think that their food would reflect this, I wanted guacamole,It doesn't even taste like Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Friendly staff adds to a great burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my burrito ,I was about to cut my losses and walk away when the worker behind the counter told me I could have the burrito gratis,the burrito is awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you've got to get the burrito bowl (with carnitas, Chipotle's salad dressing on a burrito bowl is pretty much,I have no idea how people don't put the salad dressing on the burrito bowl,the other meat can tend to be dry,Only downside is sometimes they put only a tiny bit in the little salad dressing cups,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trying to find the best Mexican food in Vancouver, This isn't the place if you want good food since my experience here isn't the greatest,I got the whole thing to go and when I go across the street it was noticeable the beef taco was cold as ice, The meat should be warm, The drink was supposed to be Pepsi but tasted really flat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wasted almost $25 and wasn't even offered to get my food remade or a refund after THEY made the mistake of giving me a wet,It ripped open and both my burrito bowls exploded onto the street,I have been to many chipotle restaurants in the united,Aside from the TINY portion sizes they had ran out of guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you want a very generic burrito with too much, Learn how to make your own burrito at home over going to this fast,rice) go here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Fresh whole real ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was even better because it made the burrito wet ,and I love a wet burrito,So I've always liked Chipotle when I used to eat chicken,So delicious ,and tasted like whoa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would rate this chipotle no stars,Never have I ever had such awful customer service at a chipotle,I love chipotle ,and have been going to chipotle's since they opened,My money is good anywhere and I actually was having a debate between wingstop and chipotle so the fact that my Friday was ruined by this was very sad,the white guy with blue eyes that dished up my chicken gave me next,to no chicken,I came today at 8/5/2016 at 5:24pm and i told the guy that served me my chicken to put more chi,I said no because its not enough chicken,I Did not say anything at this point because he already pissed me off about the chicken,He was like i'm going to charge you for double meat,The guy said i guess i will give you a couple more pieces but if you want anymore than a couple you will be charged for double meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overpriced burritos,They give you so much less meat and rice here than in the US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went here for a basic chicken burrito with rice ,01 burrito,the burrito was a let, Tortilla was fine and the rice ,but they burnt the chicken to the point where I was having to spit black,by all means cook the chicken,and beans,and beans were fine,41 for chips that I never ordered (, The whole experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is decent,I was about halfway finished when I found a long hair in my food,I prefer the bowl ,and get chips to scoop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now food quality wise i give it 4 1/2 star almost 5 because there were a few,Of course I'm always going to come back cause I really like the food, times when the quality wasn't as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always enjoy the experience and the food is pretty good,The good: pricing is affordable and quality is about right for a fast-food joint,The bad: though I call it fast-food,it does not have fast-food pricing(it's middle of the road),The ugly: line-ups are brutal and sometimes I just don't have the patience to wait for fast-food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 a burrito, You can customize your options it's similar to UGrill you can pick a bowl, or a salad ,The ingredients are varied ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food isn't bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The servers/food preps were very rushed,beginning of the line -  BEFORE they make and waste the food) I wouldn't have bothered,Even if the food is as good,A burrito shouldn't cost $10,I think it's incredibly over priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is just half of amount I had on San Francisco,even with extra guacamole it still look like a kindergarden mea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hairy chicken,stringy steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,"I find Chipotle to be the best of the ""big burrito"" style joints ",although I did humble the staff a bit as they had three different staff members attempt to wrap my burrito before giving up ,my second complaint would be that it's a $10 burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reasonably priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was in a hurry and ordered 2 burritos to go (not both for me,The lady behind the counter began by giving me attitude because I was ordering 2 burritos,I guess you only have the attention span for 1 burrito at a time,when she went to wrap the burritos,I've never been more upset at a burrito in my life,org/2013/11/24/chipotle-steak-fajita-bowl,when they ran out of rice,"they resorted to serving ""conventional steak"" due",always out of certain ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is amazing,Best burrito I've ever had , and the price is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered tonight at 8:30pm l Had an order of 4 bowls and 1 burrito,3 burrito bowls were suppose, to be half chicken and half barbacoa  instead I got just chicken and a toddlers spoon amount of barbacoa totally rip off since they charge you barbacoa price,Very little rice was given ,Asked for fajita in each bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The last station of making my steak burrito was the guacamole, Burrito didn't taste right ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I live right down the street and frequent this Chipotle almost weekly and have noticed a steady decline in food quality,Something just doesn't taste right and I cannot seem to pinpoint which food item it is,the guacamole,their most delicious item,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I go the food is good,I work in the area and this is the closest chipotle to me, but the one thing I will say is the steak is always over cooked,I personally don't enjoy chewing my steak for a few,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food ,Was to the door and took less than 5min to be seated with our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually get the chicken burrito (which seems to be really popular,I think you get more bang for your buck if you go for the burritos,I order the brown rice bowl with chicken if I'm feeling 'healthy',I'd definitely recommend the chicken,The mild salsa is actually quite spicy,)  - I tried the steak my first,but the corn is such,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I feel like you could literally go to any Mexican restaurant and pay half of the price for much better food, I also find that they don't cater to food sensitivities as well as other,the food was definitely tasty,I think from now on I'll just stick to non fast-food Mexican,but I don't think it was justified by the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They definitely don't give as much food here ,I usually can't finish a burrito bowl in one sitting,but here I consistently can eat a whole burrito bowl + a bag of chips ,Hoping their upper management sees some of the more negative reviews and try to do something about it cause it's in a great location with all these companies and college kids so it would definitely be worth the effort of stepping up their burrito stuffing ,But the one thing I do like is that their chips aren't as salty,Usually the chips are heavily salted ,and it seems like I can never get there when there's fresh off the grill meat even ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they short you on food ,Easily the worst chipotle establishment I've been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but its rubbery and cut into tiny cubes so it looks like dog food (it's not comparable,My favorite burritos have always been Anna's Tacqueria,I do get a burrito craving at least once a week,The carnitas (pork) and chicken are flavorless,The barbacoa is the most flavorful meat option,The steak is what I usually go with, to the chunks of tender steak that Anna's gives you),Instead of focusing on using organic non-GMO ingredients,to give you an idea of my taste,they should focus on taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For a healthy meal (I get the veggie bowl with no cheese) at a fair price Chipotle is a great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is not all that bad,"and they have the audacity to say ""just one second"" and work on some online order that included five burritos",just a healthier taco time with crappy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted fine,I had gotten the steak rice bowl ,but all it had was beans and rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I first experienced Chipotle Mexican Grill in Toronto over 8 years ago and I enjoyed the flavour and freshness of the food,Over the years I must say that the consistency of quality of the food has gone up ,For the price the food is good,but it's not what you call authentic Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
friendly service and the food is delish,I'm here at least once a week for yummy burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,This sole downtown outpost of the US burrito chain meets expectations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Totally boring burritos, The only good thing about this place is they are using natural chicken---free of hormones, They need to come up with different sauces and salsas, They also put the cheese on last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unless repeatedly pestered for adequate portions they will jib you for food,Long story short: terrible customer service & low food quantity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got about a tablespoon of chicken in my chicken burrito,com/news/chipotle-workers-trained-smaller-portions-164621013,"When you ask reasonable questions about ingredients (""What kinds of rice can I get",and other pricey ingredients (http://finance,I know that the employees are told to meter the  amounts of chicken,Is that salsa mild or hot,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aiden was a model employee -- he really knew how to make a perfect burrito bowl,Let me preface this review by saying this: I have never been to the needham chipotle before nor have I met any employees,and he prepared likely the best bowl that I have ever had from a chipotle restaurant,The needham chipotle is better than the chipotle,the derby street chipotle,If all chipotle employees were to model their behavior after Aidens,Aiden prepared my bowl today,Perfect ratio of all ingredients in the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I find the staff at this chipotle more personable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wanted to let her know that big bump on the front of me was not because I needed to lay off the burritos,I ordered the Barbacoa tacos,The girl put so little meat on the tacos that it almost seemed like she was kidding,The woman scolded me telling me that was all the meat allotted to a taco ,I'm pretty sure she pulled some tweezers out of her back pocket and lifted an additional shred of beef on to two of the three tacos,I love me some chipotle ,I asked for a little more meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and each burrito was delicious,There are occasionally some times when ingredients are low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got my own food ,rude staff and bad food,My daughter and I ate there for dinner it was 38$ for 3 tacos,14$ to add guacamole to each taco,The tacos were mushy ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gave me free corn tortillas with my burrito bowl (all you have to do is ask,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They give you a little bit of everything and all the toppings and protein doesn't even fill the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and always fresh food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the chicken burrito with pinto,beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fresh awesome foods ,I'll have mine in a bowl please,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we were the first clients in the morning and the girl serving the food who's name is Selena was a bitch that hates her job,I just came to the chipotle of Howe st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's remarkable and speaks to how much food fatigue there is in the area as opposed to anything positive,1) overpriced,2) bland taste,somebody at corporate who has taste buds should actually step into this restaurant ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I stopped in this evening to cash in my free burrito coupon that I just got in the mail yesterday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pretty good food except long, lineup and it tempted out my wallet cause of the high price ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the taste of the food ,I ordered a chicken burrito ,the wrapping of the burrito was a bit loose,tasted ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only do they not give enough food with each order,Make the drive there and receive hot food filled to the rim ,I never have problems like this at the chipotle in dedham,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Generally my reviews are about food ,I went in to get a burrito to go ,I'll be getting my burritos elsewhere,but since all chipotles are basically the same,but when I got to the salsa/sauce portion,I was met with a very hostile worker - all because I asked for corn,Granted she thought I was done with my toppings request but that doesn't call for a solid 5 second stare down before reaching for the corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm very disappointed with the service at this particular chipotle,I've always had a good experience at other chipotles ,He still has to pay the same amount that people who get meat pays ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Think i'll start making my own burritos at home,I get almost no lettuce and meat that is almost nothing ,at least there I know the quality will be high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Immediately rude when we went to order 5 bowls of the SAME EXACT thing in every bowl,including chicken which is probably the most popular,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First class quality food ,but that was because it is serving a stampede of customers - with good reason - food is GREAT HERE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love me some burritos,I ordered a chicken burrito from Chipotle ,Second bite: oh there's some beans and I think a bit of chicken,Third bite: there's another little piece of chicken,Fourth bite: another tiny piece of chicken - it's like a trail of breadcrumbs leading me to a grilled chicken jackpot at the bottom,No chicken jackpot,Caspian be a busy boy and he needs more than 4 or 5 little cubes of chicken,you can put a bit more of that tasty meat in them 'ritos,First bite: that's a lot of nice fresh lettuce yo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had it for the second time today chicken burrito was great,Also get the chips with guac n salsa,They give you soo many chips and the give a nice amount of salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hmmm I'm not sure what all the rave was about this place but all the food ,Maybe this place is great because of the quality of the meat,although the steak was not tender,""" meaning fresh ingredients ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Faux Mexican food for white, The food is flavourful,this place has good prices for high quality food,smile and they will load your burrito with significantly more stuff,As for those who complain about the price you can't compare with the States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but food is always fresh,95 for a burrito,$2 extra for guacamole is NOT worth it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In addition we were barely given an adequate amount of rice (not a full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's absolutely no surprise people get sick eating their food,I ordered a burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50 for a burrito with Guacamole,THe other problem is that I explained to the burrito maker that it was my first,It was good but it wasy over overpriced,For a premium price for fast food,It's too pricey for fast,it would have been better if there had been more of an explanation of the difference of the mixes and beans to choose from, There wasn't an explanation of the different in ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last night my wife bought 2 bowls to bring home so we could have a good,I started to eat my bowl ,It must have been from a bag which had one of the ingredients in it that was in my bowl,A bowl again with lettuce that was brown,when I thought I was chewing on a tough piece of shredded lettuce,It wasn't lettuce it was a 3 inch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
out of brown rice,"When I got home and began eating my ""bowl""",a spicy salsa on it - not the mild I had requested,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when im hungry and need food fast,the staff is really nice and the burritoes are huge,average for a chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,Sure the food can be a bit heavy,It's a good spot to enjoy some good food,this chipotle is fairly straight,decent prices (Except the rip-off that they charge for guac) ,Nothing better in my opinion (unless you want to give me half priced guac,I love the fajita bowl with steak,a couple of the salsas,and hold the lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To be honest I have never been a big chipotle fan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is good,Three times I have arrived after waiting an hour to come get my food ,I gave it one more try and surprisingly (even though I waited an hour and 15-20 minutes to get my food) it was ready,the food is good,There were no tomatoes and no lettuce in my burrito bowl,Left with a gross burrito bowl ,I had rice,cheese ,sour cream,and corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't think the food or service is anything different,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kinda like Subway for Tex-Mex food,like would do weird things for chipotle burritos,I've had great burritos ,and Chipotle burritos,fall a bit lower than those great burritos,I've stopped getting burritos though ,it's a build your own burrito/bowl/taco,Maybe it's because I won't ever stop loving burritos though,and have moved on to chicken bowls with a side of chips + guac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The burritos are extremely overpriced ,with choices of brown or white rice,white or black beans,mild or spicy salsa,but damn is it delicious,It's basically a really high quality taco bell to be honest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd like to introduce you to a place called mucho burrito,there was a location dt way before chipotle came around same,chipotle is nothing special, and over priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito wasn't really wrapped up nice,I went to chipotle to compare it against chronic tacos,Overall chronic tacos was better,I wasn't a fan of the taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The first time the cashier dropped my burrito on the ground, But the time I've eaten here the quality of service is not great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also found the food at Chipotle inferior,I visited Chipotle today and a chicken burrito with cuacamole , to Mucho Burrito in freshness and taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 During busy hours the food is super, Only loses a point due to food being slightly less fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(i can get a bigger portion at whole foods for the same,called chipotle ,over $2 for guac is extremely overpriced with the portion they give, price),wayyyy overpriced for my liking ,got a chicken bowl,we ordered two bowls ,and two chips&guac but only got the bowls,they left out the chips&guac,not even an extra chips & guac for the inconvenience ,rip off on the meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I must say that the Barbacoa burrito that I usual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is delicious,After a horrible horrible experience with united airways (never ever again) we went to chipotle late,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they didn't add white rice or lettuce to my burrito bowl,also got chips in my order ,but the bag had like 10-15 chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delicious food at a reasonable,healthy food choices in Columbus,that the food purchased , price,Organic ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love that the burritos are HUGE, I can be a pain about ordering as I like having both kinds of beans,and extra mild salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you get a decent food for under $10 that is fresh,I can't think of any other places here that gives you grass-fed beef or free-range chicken food for under 10 bucks,As for the food,and the food will be ready,and you can go pretty healthy with burrito bowls,But if you compare their prices to other,try to go with bowls with brown rice,and do not load up your dish with cheese ,and sour cream,organic ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was happy to have a chipotle next,pico de gallo or salsa that it was extra,They also told me it did not include guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had the chicken chipotle bowl with guac ,Although the ingredients in the bowl are pretty,Adding Tabasco sauce to it simply made the whole bowl even better,and sour cream,I was kind of skeptical about the quality of chain restaurants ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came here on a Monday night to grab some food after a movie at Scotiabank Theatre ,My friend ordered the burrito bowl ,You can choose from crispy corn tacos,soft corn tacos,soft flour tacos,I wanted to get the crispy corn tacos ,but unfortunately they were all out so I went with the soft tacos,rice,This meal also came with tortilla chips and a juice so I think it is a great late night snack at a very reasonable price,you also get to choose 3 sides: I chose chicken,and beans,This meal also came with tortilla chips ,I wanted guacamole (I believe there's an additional,and they also did not have all the ingredients either,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The burritos are so good, This particular location is right at the corner of Red Bug ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At point (after the filthy work table where the food is,I went the other day for a burrito,I think the kid was working on commission for how little he could put in the burrito,Then I asked for lettuce on my burrito ,Maybe 10 little pieces of chicken ,and he literally sprinkled about 8 little pieces of cheese,and the lettuce bin was empty,except for a few pieces of lettuce which were literally stuck to the bottom of the stainless bin (probably all day),Instead of refilling the lettuce the kid (moron) stuck his fingers in the bin ,and tried to scrape up the few pieces of wilted stuck on lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not a fan of Mexican food,but I like Chipotle dishes and way you can choose your own ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So shame on you for slow burrito crafting time,I'll make this quick because A) this is Chipotle B) people have recommended it to you before or you've been to one C) We all want the same 5 things at chipotle: ,The slowness was then appreciated when I saw the care and heavy hand placement of every ingredient,All the ingredients were fantastically fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My wife had a chicken bone in her Burrito bowl and my rice where under cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ingredients are fresh,and taste good,after not eating it for a while it was not the same amazing taste I had before,I prefer the taste of Moe's now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito was familiar, and tasted fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is disgusting,I don't understand the fascination with big portions and cheap prices but shitty tasting food,"I'm not looking for a ""deal"" or a ""steal"" I don't need my burrito to be stuffed bigger than my calves to be happy",The employees don't understand you when you say you want just a 'little' nope they scoop up the stuff like its free school cafeteria shit and lay on the sauces thick (maybe there are actually customers who complain that the burritos are too small,the guy still managed to dump a ladle full of the green stuff on my burrito,After I repeatedly insisted that I wanted a tiny bit of guacamole,A mouthful of guacamole + sour,The sour cream got the same,organic ingredients ,and yada yada yada but everything tastes so bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I normally don't eat burritos ,but I like chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They always give so little food,For the same price,you get half of the main ingredients (rice,50ish you get a nice adobo chicken bowl,""" And the server always adds one cube of chicken ",beans,and meat),"I always ask ""can you add more meat please",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we have gotten food from this location about three more times since I posted my review originally, The rice has been crunchy,while serving up smaller portions for the same price, If I want what USED to be normal meat on a bowl,I have to ask for  (and pay for) double meat, The carnitas meat has less flavor,but they're losing that loving feeling with their loyalists by letting standards and quality slide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
every chipotle i've been to has been on point with consistently great food , they were also out of chips (, i had to repeat my order of child's cheese quesadilla a few,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is pretty,average chipotle food,They are one of the worst chipotle's I've ever been to as far as inventory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The other issue is it is such a busy lunch time place during the week that the tables are always dirty and covered in food pieces,But the food is always great,My biggest complaint is that they can never wrap a burrito tight,Even a regular burrito with no added,It would be better to just get the burrito bowl with tortilla on the side due,to how bad they wrap the burritos,The line staff gets so overwhelmed they forget what they are doing and make your burrito with the wrong,I love chipotle , ingredients because they either didn't listen or were not paying attention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I won't talk much about the food because it's pretty much,and while it's not the most authentic Mexican food,I do find it quite tasty and priced well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Faux Mexican food for white, This place has crazy prices - we're talking $15 for a burrito meal - ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So on the food alone we are up a few,Cheers to great food ,Love the veg black bean burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burrito sizes varied,It took 15 minutes to get a burrito ,and tacos,why the hell is the vegetarian option the same price as the chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not on the food,although the salad portions were still not up to par,but it tasted like Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The floor is littered with food , The woman sitting near me is a vegan and she discovered that they had put chicken in her burrito bowl despite her warning against it,I'm staying in the nearby hotel this week and this chipotle is conveniently located so I have stopped to eat here twice , the chips are very stale,"but when I asked if they had any fresh chips the woman at the counter said "" we got what we got",The guacamole is sort of a grayish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chalk it up to how Mexican food seems to a rising trend in Vancouver,choice of chipotle lime,The portions are HUGE for the price (8, rice or even brown,rice,pinto or black beans,And the toppings are great quality (roasted corn,fresh quality for a chain restaurant ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went to pick it up and they explained that there was something wrong with one of the orders but they threw in an extra burrito to make up for it,Other people would bite take a burrito with their name on it,everyone was missing salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Usual food,corn salsa side,Lots of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 In other words clear signs of choices reinforced by clear clean messages from workers dishing out the portions on those burritos,do not wrap those burritos until the customer has completed decided on what to put in it,  Avocado is an extra cost even if you did not get all the ingredients that they did not disclose that you could have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had the veggie burrito,My son had the Carnitas burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had the pleasure of enjoying the first Chipotle burrito ever made in Vancouver , My personal favourite is the chicken burrito (don't forget the lime cilantro rice,Price is a bit high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If this is your first time eating at chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they dropped my tacos,picking up a taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While the food ,It was the most blatant and disgusting waste of food I have witnessed in a long,I find it disturbing that anyone would just throw out good food like that,the customer in line ahead of me ordered a chicken burrito ,and a vegetarian burrito,The girl behind the counter mistakenly made two chicken burritos,The staff member took the extra chicken burrito,What's worse was the fact there was a long line-up of customers and the woman immediately after me ordered a chicken burrito,already filled with rice ,and chicken ,and quality is decent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"71 for ""double meat"" and Guacamole bowl",The guy in front of me had slightly less meat then I did with a normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 scrapped off what's left to make my burrito,my wife and I come in and they are completely out of chicken,We simply asked what the other meats were ,just some scraps at the corners of the pan,The only reason why I come back here is because it's a taste of home,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I had a barbacoa burrito,light on the rice ,and beans,heavy on the salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Despite reliably good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't think the guy who prepped my burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll be going to another location next time I want chipotle,Now they're cheap chips that they charge you for ,I got the steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  The way I referred to it to the wife was the Whole Foods of burrito places,how big does the burrito have to be, Price wise,  bring the price either down on the whole,or just down for that guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They have about 6 people behind the counter all performing 1 step in the taco/burrito building process,I ordered a steak burrito, The meat was a bit tough, I guess the ingredients are pretty,but I have to say I think a McDonald's meal tastes better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Besides the food which was awesome,I was number two to walk in and first one in the city to get a Steak Chipotle burrito bowl, Never seen so much love and burritos under one roof, The steak was extra juicy and tender and the jasmine rice was just the way I like it,Does it taste the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the man 2 burritos ,chicken ,steak,and cheese ,it only consisted on lettuce,(lame excuse on my part I was craving their salad),"This was the first time in history that my son (8) wanted to have ""just a salad"" for dinner ",fully loaded veggie salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I can't say that I've ever had a bad experience with the food, Good food overall, I like the fact that the source of their meat is from a more cruelty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food, Their chicken burritos are the best,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the guy next to me ordering a ""burrito"" gets a huge",what's with the small scoop of chicken when getting tacos,Start weighing the chicken and stop ripping off your customers small portions of chicken on tacos,White or brown rice,more chicken is extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Obviously chipotle is delicious,We have never had to wait before at a chipotle like that,OH and the most disgusting part of it all was that BOTH those times I came home and found hair in my chipotle,What I mean by this is every time I have gone ther steak was out,I would rather drive to boulder than be handed a complimentary drink because I have to wait for steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but if you can handle the burrito,It's a beast of a burrito,I'd recommend a salad bowl if you're a small,Some of the tastiest chips I've ever had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle personally,I told the girl I would like a chicken bowl with a tortilla on the side,finally the girl told the cashier to charge me for 2 bowls,In the end I paid for the bowl ,Never ever go here because when I was eating the bowl there was HAIR in it,and she proceeded to put on hot salsa sauce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great healthy food, You can customize your order and get real chicken ,and meat everytime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's beyond greedy it's a monument of greedy corporate food-chain hubris,The only reason to go here is that you have a craving for a burrito ,and none of the real burrito places are open, They also don't know how to properly roll a burrito,05 to add a thwap of guac to a burrito,"Service:  Their service is like the punchline to a joke that begins ""How many people does it take to make a burrito", Plus the burritos are amazing,Pricewise: The prices aren't bad, The ingredients seem reasonably fresh, You end up with a big overfilled pocket of ingredients guaranteed to self-destruct as you try to eat it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 And if there's a line when you arrive to pick up your pre-ordered food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I got a burrito with chicken ,25 for a chicken burrito ,and white rice, The brown rice is always undercooked,Very pricey,if you don't then you eat a lot rice ,The chicken meat still has skin on it,and added everything but the avocado and salsa,Very skimpy on ingredients especially meat , I haven't found attitude and yes twice I've had to wait for the meat I want,Very fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
beans,salsa,and meat, you do need to pay extra for guacamole which I usually pass on,ask them to hold off on the sour cream,I find it's a healthy meal with fresh lettuce ,I usually get the salad with shredded,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I even mentioned to my husband how I felt like they gave us even MORE meat than usual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Price of food will always be more here than the U,So let's stop comparing our food with them,We have higher standards in food prep too,One of those times the rice in my chicken burrito was undercooked,The second time my chicken burrito was perfect,I ordered chicken burrito to go,They were in a hurry to finish my order by rolling the burrito w/o the lettuce,The price is 'Canada,The chicken was a little,I was abrupt in telling them to add lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've always liked Chipotle's food,I didn't like their poor signage on what was free and what was extra charge for your food,This applies to all food places in the area,Found out the hard way when my burrito was more expensive,But the Chipotle in Kendall is smart enough to not let fresh faces leave angry at the price difference,They have it posted right there that guacamole is extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it's still delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you need a mood lifter after your burrito,offers a better selection of ingredients,Food quality is average-high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a burrito bowl ,and was given a bowl full,of burnt chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At kendall/mit restaurant people are friendly and give high quality food expected of chipotle,Did you know chipotle guarantees no gmo in their food,Did you also know that premium tacos are as expensive,as chipotle tacos,Big fan of chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very low qunatity of food is served ,Worst chipotle i have ever seen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no rice,I had the steak salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but shocking perhaps only because some of us may be nostalgic for a time in the US when a Chipotle burrito was $5-6,and Vancouver eaters won't be terribly shocked by the $9 for a burrito,it isn't the burrito,that is driving prices up),I pre-ordered my Carnitas bowl online on Opening Day preemptively expecting crowds (there were),so my Vancouver bowl had a great,the guacamole was as delicious,but the guacamole at over $2 for a tiny,it is still that delicious Chipotle I know ,As far as taste is concerned,I'm glad to note it doesn't taste exactly like a Chipotle in New York--wouldn't that be concerning if it did,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And she gives me half chicken ,I asked for half steak ,and have steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even if you do wait in line and eventually get your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There were bits of food on the tables ,I had to sweep food from my table ,Had the chicken burrito today which was good,The quality of the chicken meat was much better than other places I've had burritos from such,You can actually see the char marks on the chicken meat whereas at Red Burrito ,and Chronic the chicken looks like string meat which has been boiled or steamed,25 for guacamole is such,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I find the prices a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their chicken quesadilla and chicken burritos are both pretty good,the ingredients are of reasonable quality for this price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I honestly feel that because they got pissed off at me because I was asking politely how I wanted my food prepared,I will not ever be visiting this venue in the future and I would also advise anyone else to avoid this place as well unless you want food made not how you want it by staff that don't want to talk to you or listen to you or do their job ,and then mix it together before wrapping the burrito,and then they added a second tortilla after the staff member complained that the burrito wouldn't roll,After getting home and finally sitting down to eat I took one bite and not only was the burrito bl, which is their job and part of what makes Chipotle they purposely sabotaged my burrito,I have since thrown the burrito in the trash,it is very quick and easy to make with two tortillas and cheese melted in between them that's done on the steamer,so I got a tortilla with burnt and dry cheese on it,but all I could taste was Tabasco sauce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worst wrap job on a burrito ever,Stick to the bowls ,and salads at this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had the barbacoa burrito,Next time I'll try the burrito bowl ,I went for the medium salsa which was a great,and the chips,pay the extra charge for the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food does not have the taste/consistency of the majority of Chipotle locations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 At the nearby food truck run by Jose's Mexican Restaurant,Bottom line: This food may cut it in a suburban,shopping plaza or a mall food court , I recommend either of Mexicali's locations or the food truck run by Jose's Mexican Restaurant, All are 2-3 minute walks away with better quality food,The main burrito ingredients are lost in a sea of filler rice, See my photo of the burrito's cross-section in the gallery, It felt like eating a balloon full of rice, Jose's is almost half the cost and Mexicali is about the same price as Chipotle,My usual order: Steak Burrito with black beans,salsa , There was very little meat and salsa in this meal,25) and plain tortilla chips ($1,The bag of chips was maybe 10% full, Why would they a) use such a large bag for so few chips or b) provide so few,chips with your order,they include a small amount of chips with your order for free,they charge extra for an equally small amount of chips, There was very little meat ,and cheese ($7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and / or scraps of food on them,I chose to just eat my food at home which was btw great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is prepared,the food outweighs the brief,I've never been so addicted to a burrito in my life,the burrito will be the size of a brick,Burrito with any meat plus brown rice,black beans,tomato and mild salsa,cheese and guacamole (added,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I tried ordering two steak burritos with cilantro,I noticed the burrito wrappers torn , rice ,and black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The steak burrito is delicious,The portions are quite large and are decently priced,They give you the option to make your order into a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a place that specializes in Mexican food didn't have beans,Came here 03/31/17 at around 9pm and they had absolutely 0 beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 That is an outrageous price in my expert,But why the hell are the pinto beans made with bacon, This girl wants to eat the gd pinto beans,corn salsa,fresh tomato salsa,There is something for the meat eaters , And there are a lot of meat choices too,Spoiler alert: The guacamole is an extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got it in a salad because i thought the burrito would he too difficult,I got sick of it after a few bites and the portion was pretty small for its price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really like their chicken burrito,I guess they are sort of like Subway for burritos like some people say ,I like that I am able to have options on what I want in my burrito,They are pretty pricey for a burrito ,but it is my favourite burrito place,One drawback is the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This lame crunchy taco literally had two small,For the price,pieces of steak inside it,and a sea of sour cream ,and so-so lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was fresh,A family staple for us remains Chipotle when we need healthy fresh food on the go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am well travelled and have eaten in some dumps in third world countries but this place was even worse cleanliness-wise and food-wise,The place was literally littered with garbage all over and the food was disgusting ,The food tasted like soiled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been to this chipotle multiple,I love the chipotle franchise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ordered a burrito bowl ,and got a tiny scoop of rice,tiny scoop of chicken,tiny scoop of beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito bowl was half,I can usually only eat 1/3 of a burrito bowl,"the chicken was burnt (""Why so crispy","and I asked for ""A TON"" of lettuce",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can go buy myself an avocado from Nesters and add it in my food instead,they're the same sized tacos from a regular  taco/ burrito bus in the States,In regards to the complaints of the 'small tacos',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food not bad,Great food though,I recommend the hard tacos,prices ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Glad there is a location close to my work always great quality food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
small burritos,I enjoy Chipotle burritos,but this location always has extremely long lines during the lunch hour (sometimes out the door) and the burritos are a lot smaller than any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
made to order burrito bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of food is always very good,My favorite is Salad with brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The sofritas burrito is my all time favorite,It's spicing is phenomenal and it always hits the spot when I'm in a burrito mood,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these are not fast food ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I love chipotle and this store has always been great with customer service and food quality ,first time ever I've been disappointed by chipotle,I still love chipotle ,I realize the concept of healthy no gmo ingredients ,I envision a taste of cheesy yumminess ,and this queso literally tasted like broccoli cheddar soup,I wonder who they had taste this for market research before bringing it out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh chipotle,This Chipotle like Chipotles everywhere: delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We received the food ,After hearing a friend say positive things about the burritos here we decided to give it a try,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm assuming this has something to do with the food-h,efficient staff and meat portions that don't require you to ask for double,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it's a travel fav - you know what to expect: good food,and my steak burrito,and decently priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It is far from authentic mexican food ,I've had chipotle in the US ,but it is delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food was fresher than the next,I was going to get a burrito until I noticed that the flour tortilla had 670mg of sodium ,and they didn't have corn tortilla for the burrito,a Friday and a Saturday and I had the same thing: the burrito bowl,there were no black beans left in the pan ,There was no consistency from my two visits in either service or quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I asked twice yesterday whether there were corn tortillas available, I was told clearly by the person on the til that ALL of the wraps and tortillas were made of corn flour, I then asked the person heating up the tortillas if I could please have corn tortillas, She insisted that these were made of corn flour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I understand making more food is time consuming ,Having worked in food service for almost ten years,it's also very frustrating to see someone touching their face while handling food,but please refrain from putting your hand on your face while you touch my food,I ordered a burrito bowl today as usual,brown rice,I also asked for beans,but when you try to give me a tablespoons worth of corn and a small pinch of the meat I had on the meal,sour cream and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Now they give you minimal food ,and glare at you if you question the amount and the food is lukewarm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expensive (for what you get) pseudo-Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their food is very good,i can eat chipotle everyday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Exactly what you'd expect from a chipotle,Overpriced ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The portions were a good size and the ingredients were great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I believe the manager was the one who was making my burrito,He could see my disappointment and offered to add sliced avocado and lime juice to my burrito instead,He also gave me the burrito for free,When we got to the guacamole, since they were out of the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Don't mind chaos if they make a good burrito - unfortunately that hasn't been the case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is good,It's just that there are a lot of other burrito/taco joints in Vancouver that also serve delicious food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tasty burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm only writing this because the lady who was serving my food did not know how to fill the ladle with more than quarter of the food,I'm never going to this chipotle ever again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Looking at my partially filled bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with brown rice,The chicken here will never be tough,double chicken,double black beans,mild tomato salsa,guacamole ,and lettuce,The ingredients are incredibly fresh,so you taste all the genuine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good Mexican food is hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First time at Chipotle -- Have seen it in the States throughout my travels but have never eaten in one thinking the food would be equivalent,I must say I was PLEASANTLY SURPRISED by the freshness and tastiness of the Chipotle burrito bowl ,and the chicken burrito,00 was a bit pricey for the dollop of what you got , The small cup of guacamole for 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they gave me normal portion and quality that is to be expect of the chipotle chain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good chicken burrito with lots of toppings (quantity),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their standards are always good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually go for a burrito or bowl,mild salsa ,I recommend getting it on the side with chips,and lettuce to increase the size of your meal,quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The don't give a shit about my food they are so sloppy, and just throw on the ingredients without even looking at my damn burrito they are blankly,I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the same burritos,Once they fix the price a bit (make it a flat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,I usually get chicken and rice on my burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The soft beef tacos I had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice in the burrito bowl was completely uncooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The staff is friendly and the food is quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then waited almost 20 minutes for our burritos,The burritos got cold, waiting for the guacamole to be finished,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito wasn't properly wrapped so it was a disaster,Barbacoa burrito is a good,Although I went there yesterday and they didn't' have guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had ordered a brown rice burrito with steak,Can't you have rice *without* cilantro,Fortunately I can have sour cream to drown out the putrid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nothing special about the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30 to get a burrito ,i tried to get her attention 5 times but she was too interested in the staff meeting going on to the side to stop wrapping the burrito ,I love chipotle,and they were out of brown rice,but wasn't really told when the brown rice was going to be ready, You'd think if the brown rice was a hot,I wanted cheese ,and lettuce,and put in lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Peruse the menu carefully as you will not notice to add guacamole to a burrito ,at paying nearly $15 for a pop or soda and chicken burrito,I begin to look at my burrito which is extremely low,Both the burrito , on chicken which was disappointing to say the least,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nothing wrong with my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food is always fresh and just super delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I had things but on my chicken burrito that I didn't ask for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is it a problem that before I even order I know my burrito ,It's a standard chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
smirking at you or trying to rush through the line (once they just dumped by food into a bag without asking ,Nobody seems to know how to roll a burrito here (both times they fell apart ,Usually have to ask them to add more of something after someone there dumps 2 tablespoons of rice into my burrito,Guacamole is usually brown/oxidized and rice often undercooked,Don't bother with chips here as they are usually chewy,and well below the quality I'm used,Food quality is almost always low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The line at lunchtime is long so the staff is just trying to get you out the door and as a result you feel rushed and the food is prepared,There is nothing good I can say about the burritos or service here,and the cheese was not melted at all but just bunched up in one corner of the burrito,I also found a couple of pieces of chicken in my carnitas burrito,the rice , They were in such a rush preparing it that piecies of chicken ,and salsa tasteless,and meat were flying around everywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the girl rolling the to go burritos had NO idea what she was doing,She threw out 2 attempts before she finished my burrito,which when i got back to work i discovered was 1/2 the size of a normal burrito ,They seriously need an experienced burrito roller doing the to go orders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and this time they were out of sour cream,On my first visit my friend and I ordered salads,so we'd have to eat our salad with spoons,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I needed lots of inexpensive food containers to help conference guests bring extra,food home,and the manager gave a package of paper bowls ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I used to visit this Chipotle very regularly in the late hours because of the friendly staff and quality food,) The presentation of the food has gone downhill as well,I constantly get runny food,The last straw was when the cashier touched my food right after taking cash from a customer,she literally stuck her bare hand in my food,I used to get a nicely laid out burrito bowl,Its very unappetizing to have soup in the bottom of a burrito,chicken,same goes for beans,and sour cream seem to have fallen in quality,now I get slop shoved into one corner of the container while the other,when I want corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just think that this particular location needs to work on customer service and basic food safety,I ordered my vegetarian bowl,The cheese (I don't eat any form of dairy) tray was right next to the guac and as I saw him scoop it up to put in my bowl,I tried to stop him before he put it in the bowl ,but he didn't recognize me trying to stop him until he dropped it into the bowl,I had to ask him to make me a new bowl,All of the workers were annoyed and very dramatically threw my partially made bowl in the trash,I saw a lot of cheese that had fallen into the guac from the workers moving quickly,So he started to use his hands to PICK OUT the pieces of cheese that had already been hidden in the guac,in which the workers barely filled with the base ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food has been consistently good,but that's why you should pre-order your food online ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My dad said the food was alright ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only was somehow all of the food on line cold,the person who tried to wrap my mess of a burrito couldn't keep his gut out of the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yo so my chic went here today to grab a chicken and brown rice bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the chicken burrito,we're paying over $12 for an enormous burrito with a little, There was a lot of rice ,and beans,there really wasn't much meat i, bit of meat, It was huge and tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quick burrito to go,Brown rice,fresh chicken,black beans,cheese lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food just that good, You can pay more and double the meat too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Outside of this they also had a staff member who continued to sneeze into her arm while on the line serving food,While my daughter was training she was told that if any food item falls you have to immediately throw it away,Why was this person allowed to continue in the food industry shocks me ,The same employee was also bagging chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I first experienced Chipotle Mexican Grill in Toronto over 8 years ago and I enjoyed the flavour and freshness of the food,Over the years I must say that the consistency of quality of the food has gone up ,For the price the food is good,but it's not what you call authentic Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I think the burritos looks better,My rice bowl was not bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you need quick food that tastes good,Descent price for amount of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always have great service and food at this chipotle although,they need to make sure they cook their meat all the way - it's no fun eating meat raw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Watched one employee take a break - and sit at a dirty table - while another was cleaning the kitchen while food was being prepared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and they give you a lot of food per serving,but they make up for it by giving you a TON of food,my bowl was really watery and the rice didn't feel like it was cooked all the way,I get a veggie bowl every time I go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The people who serve the food stuff really need to underst,I basically received 1/2 of a burrito bowl,Its like even when you ask them to give you extra corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pretty disappointing when your burrito leaves you half satisfied,Not only are their meats never fresh off the grill but their portions are actually below the already low chipotle baseline,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the food here,My favorite is the Chicken Burrito Bowl with guacamole (this is extra,50 for a salad,which seems expensive until you taste it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and to top it off my burrito was about half the size it should have been,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and all the options with no questions asked when you want extra sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both time I ended up going south and got high fever from food poisoning,I don't know who handle the food safety there, I had white rice/chicken/mild, salsa/corn at this place twice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Filling food , Decent food , Tasty chicken burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All the Mexican food here was okay,I could place an order right away and got my food quickly,5 stars  I ordered a barbacoa burrito as well as guacamole with chips,The burrito was quite filling,The burrito had both warm,One side of burrito was warm,I asked for brown rice,beans or peas ,I liked the guacamole with chips,The chips were not like the ones that we bought from supermarkets, because it had some cooked meat,They tasted and went well with guacamole,lettuce,corn ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was fresh,I noticed immediately that all of the main items (burritos,I  ordered the chicken burrito,It was the biggest burrito I have ever had,tacos,bowls and salads) were all the same price,It was stuffed with brown rice,chicken,chicken was moist ,black beans,pinto beans,home made salsa,sour cream and guacamole,because i hate to spend almost 10 bucks on lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've found the food ,If burritos at chipotle costed $1 less,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The burrito was the smallest one I ever got at a Chipotle, They gave a such a small amount of rice that it barely covered the bottom of the bowl, They measured the chicken by using something that looked like a shot glass - a tiny,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good food,and quac burrito,3 other people were with me and had burrito,n tacos for the kiddo,I have been chipotle deprived working in Montana ,light rice,bowl,so finally I get to enjoy myself an awesome chicken,corn salsa,hot salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been to Chipotle a few times but never had this protein its now my favorite moist and juicy portion was well worth the price,I got a bowl with barbacoa,med salsa and black beans,sour cream,The ingredients were fresh, and tastey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the bowls they are my favorite,And also if you want to get two bowls, pay together cuz the guacamole would be free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
generous portions all at good prices for office workers,I got a half carnitas and a half chicken with white rice,Price           $,I usually get a bowl since it's easier to eat,This bowl is a bit different,This one is a carnitas bowl with a tortilla,fresh tomato mild salsa,21 for guacamole) I tried their chips too ,guacamole,21 for guacamole),cheese,sour cream,corns and lettuce ($8,fresh ingredients,+ Fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What I also don't like is how they just slap your food together like it's a cafeteria food,rice,This place the employees gives out the smallest portion of meat,and salad  out of any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is always great,but the food always hits the spot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Solid chipotle joint in Cambridge,They're usually very generous on their meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Conveyor belt food ,and overpriced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a chicken burrito,The price was okay too,and they forgot to put on the sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On another note the food still simply delicious,and the quality of ingredients is top-notch,Its quality is always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a burrito bowl for lunch for work & ,they gave me white rice with just chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 g8 food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the Carnita burrito,Chicken salad, The portions seemed bit small especially the salad, The ingredients were quite fresh,weren't cooked thoroughly - tasted kinda raw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my chicken-burrito-bowl-with-white-rice-black-beans-pico-,and-lettuce tasted so delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would give this restaurant a 5-star rating because their food is fantastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love this chipotle,I don't get any weird looks when I pass on the rice ,and beans ,and opt for double meat ,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good, as good as any burrito place around, I recommend the fajita burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This fast food Mexican chain specializes in customized burritos,Barbacoa Burrito: this shredded braised beef burrito was packed full,tacos, 620 calories for three soft carnitas tacos ain't so bad,You can customized most ideas on the menu - add or subtract cilantro-lime rice,rice ,adobo-marinated and grilled chicken or steak) or guacamole,pinto or black beans,black beans,salsa ,chips ,meat (braised carnitas or barbacoa,and cheese or sour,sour cream,and guac with fresh high quality ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Watched some people arrive to do call ahead pick up orders and there food was not ready,and when I got to the front they were inexplicably out of white rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So the food at Chipotle is good,for my dietary issues and I really like the burrito bowls,The meat is tender ,I like the taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 No issue with the presentation of the food , And while I was taking a photo of the kitchen staff in action on the food assembly line, I ordered the chicken bowl ,but I did find the salsa/sauces surprisingly bl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food isn't that great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I tried it in Vancouver for the first time today and had the carnitas tacos,Unfortunately for me I had my tacos slathered in it ,Tasted as good as I remember but the hot salsa was so un-godly,This could've been a simple error and I'm willing to go back and try again or switch salsa types altogether,and ate it with chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a chicken bowl,and the portion was significantly smaller than the usual overflowing bowl I'm used to at other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really like this because I prefer to eat food that are ethical,I had been in Mexico and the food does not compared to Chipotle food,the food has the highest quality than most Mexican,The only other place that can compete with their food is Tocofino,I am giving this place a 5 stars because it is a fast food place that provide the highest food quality that out shines restaurant that sit you down,the quality of the taco is awesome,They marinated overnight in a spicy chipotle adobo,I like their white rice with cilantro,I have tried the brown rice,but the white rice taste better because it is softer so it absorbed more flavor,The chicken is nice,you definitely need the guacamole or salsa sauce ,They make their own chips,when ordering chips,That includes meat raised without the use of sutherapeutic,"They serve ""ingredients that are raised with respect for animals",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was no one else waiting for food ,I will try the chipotle in oviedo from now on,We went inside to pick up a 2 bowl order,they made one bowl wrong,and when I mentioned they are making the bowl wrong,They begin to make a second bowl ,and there was no need to rush to make the bowl wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perhaps because I'm used to restricted food choices,the food is always reasonably fresh,Back to the food: It's st,- I like chipotle in general,but they are better than most places in that they make some price adjustment at all for the meatless entree,I did like that the second person on the assembly line added a few more veggies to my bowl ,"when I said ""no meat"" and he realized it was a vegetarian bowl",I'll be going back regularly for my vegetarian bowl,to the person that asked why the veggie and chicken options cost the same,note that the veggie option includes guacamole in lieu of meat,where with the meat options it costs extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great fast food and a good price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the easy win of the food world,We got two burritos,mid way through the burrito fell apart,You can't go wrong with a Mexican burrito,This build your own burrito concept is a popular,rice,with all the liquids from the sauces and salsa,salsa,meat,cheese,and sour cream,lettuce,But tasted delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it used to be much more and now they give so little chicken - only 1 small,They give less meat now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito itself is gigantic,It's been proven eating one chicken burrito will increase your happiness by 7% ,One of the best burritos I have ever had ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The steak bowl is my go-to,and it seems like the portions are getting smaller and the quality less consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ended up being disappointed as my chicken tacos were ice,I was excited to try the new chipotle in town,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but smaller burritos than others - say the one by BC, Have had a couple of problems with chips not being crispy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I first experienced Chipotle Mexican Grill in Toronto over 8 years ago and I enjoyed the flavour and freshness of the food,Over the years I must say that the consistency of quality of the food has gone up ,For the price the food is good,but it's not what you call authentic Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a total of 20 pieces of shredded lettuce,not even the usual lettuce for the salad,I ordered a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
beware: the females behind the counter are snobs and will give you a TABLE SPOON of rice ,and dab of  SALSA sauce and GLOBS of sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My guess is that the workers dont know how to properly roll a stuffed burrito so we all get shortchanged,This chipotle has such a great,For a more definitive answer for why this chipotle is so terrible,you can email its manager Robyn Sylves at rsylves@chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Chipotle and understand food prices,Just went here for lunch and I usually get double meat because I don't eat rice or beans in my burrito bowl,Asked for double carnitas and dude put less in the bowl than would be appropriate,after he scraped the last bit out of the pan and moved my bowl down the line, for a single portion of meat,All in all they didn't charge me for 2 different meats,So I told him to just put some steak in there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food was delicious and fresh chips ,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Made it to the till and the cashier starts to charge the line of people who have come in to collect food,The food was not bad,So my burrito was sat there getting cold,My toppings were all added in spoonfuls and not spread along the length of the tortilla so I had eaten all my meat half way through the burrito ,With other great burrito places I don't see why anyone would bother coming here,and then had a sour cream and guacamole blob that I couldn't manage to eat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's like the subway of Mexican food,although the meat portions are pretty small, they do top it up with sour cream and cheese (which is what I like anyways,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Have been working in the area lately so I went to Chipotle for lunch and was happy with the food ,Their burritos/bowl are a little,I like brown rice,but I think they are overpriced ,Was greeted before I got to the counter and the employees followed directions accurately as they built my bowl, I get it on the side but you can get it in the bottom of the bowl if that is the way you prefer it,I have had employees pull meat from my bowl ,double meat pork/chicken,green salsa,I like they make their chips fresh,I hate having to pay for double meat as opposed to just getting a half ,but they are so skimpy with their meat if you don't double it,and light lettuce,full scoop of corn,and it is sometimes a matter of taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
went thru the line when I got to the salsa I get the medium spice green,salsa NOT this time looks like the stuff had sat out over night,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
brown rice,I ordered a bowl with chicken,lettuce and guacamole (extra,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only surprise was a good one (a bunch of free chips thrown in when our helpers went to pick up the burritos),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food that was left on the table was simply pushed off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They really need to do something with their chicken ,The chicken has pieces of fat that taste like it's almost uncooked,Are they skimping on the chicken by adding skin ,I like fat and skin on chicken as long as it is not soft,and stale chips,And twice I've gotten chips there in two weeks ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then you're aware of their assembly-line production of the burritos/tacos/etc,so if you want a burrito,Though the burritos are massive,you get to choose your meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well staffed and fresh food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I expect better service from chipotle for this price,All the fork containers have labels with forks on them but they're all spoons :( This is really disappointing because I was looking forward to being able to hold onto my salad properly while eating it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delicious healthy food,and a great price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I never had a burrito so bad,I could have gone to Taco Bell and had a cheaper and less poisonous burrito,and there was a pinch of meat ,The sour cream tasted gross,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They're efficient and your food is made with an assembly-line,Don't think i'll be eating a burrito again anytime soon from there,it was just a huge burrito,com/2012/how-to-hack-chipotle/ ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and consistently great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are known for line-ups because the food is good,It's your Mexican subway but better food,food is good,95 either for burrito,I'm a fan of their burrito bowls,taco,My favourite is either the barbacoa or chicken with brown rice,salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love their food,great price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our latest favorite meal is the get a chicken bowl,chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been stopping here 3 or 4 times a month and getting 2 burrito bowls ,rice ,At this time she called out for more rice,leaving her with no rice ,they are out of rice,It's not the kids slopping stuff into my bowl that are the problem it's the guys who refill the meat,The girl who put the meat in my bowl asked for more pork as soon as she noticed that they were low,still cutting the chicken at half speed,they ran out and the guy cutting the meat,they guy cutting the meat disappeared into the back,one of who was the meat cutting dude st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The highlight of my chipotle experience is the chips & guac- today this was ruined by the chips being extremely undercooked,My barbacoa bowl was uneventful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food ,I usually go with the barbacoa bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freshness of the food looks hit or miss,Will be cutting back from this chipotle until they get their act together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love that they use free range chicken ,as I have an onion allergy and salsa is never an option for me,and there's no MSG or antibiotics in their meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the food, if you want to sell burritos,the chicken and salsa in my burrito were tasty,"I am very conflicted and insulted with the fact that this place uses the Náhuatl word ""chipotle"" as their trade mark"," Its horrible that when you google ""chipotle"" the first",rice,again thanks to the salsa and chicken which did have some flavour,was the afored mentioned chicken I ate ,beans,I like the fact that at least they are trying to make people think about the origin of the meat they are eating,cheese ,and it did not taste of Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is still good,but he made it clear while helping me price the burritos that his main,not simply giving me the minimum number of burritos,I have been frequently comped by managers for guac and extra meat for being a good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the fact that the food is local,pretty tasty - It's not the food that I have a problem with,dried out food,the very hardworking folks at the counter are shouting out to some seemingly nonexistent employees in the back that they need more of [fill in the blank] and none is ever forthcoming because there simply is no sense of urgency (or perhaps not enough planning ahead to make the right amount of food so it doesn't run out),So in the end I've paid way too much for a way too small portion of unnecessarily mediocre food,they scrape the bottom of the bowl for whatever miniscule amount of meat or rice or whatever that they have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burrito bowls I buy are huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Friendly and satisfying food,Excellent chicken bowl with salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Where are you getting a better burrito in Vancouver,and decently priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 If you really want quick to order Mexican food that's cheaper , You start by choosing if you want a burrito,I opted for a chicken burrito with brown, The corn mixture was cold compared to the rest of the burrito,but the burrito itself was alright,and I have to give them respect for how they handled the woman in front of me who kept asking for more of everything on the burrito ,or tacos,you choose if you want white cilantro-lime rice,brown cilantro-lime rice,"or plain rice (which they referred to as ""clean",21 extra - pricey,cilantro-lime rice,but overpriced,bowl,and bowl she ordered,you choose if you want chicken,you choose if you want black or pinto beans,no beans,you can choose salsa (mild,and a corn salsa,hot salsa, The hot salsa has some kick,guacamole ($2,steak,cheese,and cheese,sour cream,corn,salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hardly a small portion for veggie burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a sofritas (vegetarian tofu mixture) burrito,Good thing I cut my burrito in half before taking a bite out of it,I'm going to assume this was from rice falling into the black, beans - again,because I immediately found 2 huge chunks of meat,I ordered the sofritas because I don't eat meat,I would have been very upset if I had accidentally gobbled down on some random chunks of meat,With them having a product they know is vegetarian they should be very careful to not *accidentally* be dropping meat all up in it,Oh and they were out of lettuce,NO RICE (because the taste of cilantro,all was fine until one particular bite where I just got a huge attack of cilantro taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We use chipotle as a less guilty,I usually get a bowl or a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is kept fresh,I have moved from eating the burritos - which are huge,The prices are good,The variety is small - which is how they keep the prices low, - to eating the salads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do not order via app & monitor burrito making process - they made me a bowl,as they gave me a bowl instead of a wrap - only discovered by the time I got to my apartment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just a couple burritos & a side of their queso & chips (which we'd never had before),The burritos -- YUCK,Husband had a carnitas burrito,I found that they hadn't even wrapped my burrito completely,Husband's carnitas burrito barely had any meat -- it looked like a half or quarter portion,rice,the rice was undercooked,His rice was likewise undercooked, Mine was a veggie: black beans,fresh tomato & roast corn salsas,"the ""fresh tomato salsa"" tasted like it'd been made weeks ago & had been in the fridge far too long",extra cheese,sour cream,no sour cream that I could find (,and the roast corn tasted more like,canned corn slopped together with dried,There's too many other restaurants around you that are taking your business by doing just that -- cutting corners to save money is just going to keep your downward,Melted cheap velveeta with a can of hormel's tastes better than that crap you gave us,It was grainy & watery (as if it'd solidified & been remelted) & had a decided off taste to it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a quesadilla that is used to wrap your burrito,they said yes and proceeded to make what we thought would be the quesadilla for the burrito,They proceeded to put all of the ingredients into the burrito fold it up ,"When my boyfriend opened his burrito I had asked him ""I thought you ordered a quesarito"" he replied I thought so too",40 for burrito ,I went to the cashier her name is Darrelynn (same girl) and said ummm we were charged for a quesadilla and a burrito ,when all we got was a bit of melted cheese on his burrito also note*,* we didn't get any shredded cheese on his which is included in the cost of the burritos,70 for melted cheese on our burrito ,apparently a quesadilla-burrito to them just means melt the cheese on your burrito ,and then charge you the price of a quesadilla and burrito,50 to turn your burrito into a quesarito,My boyfriend loveeees QUESARITOs from chipotle,we have been to chipotle many,I have been researching and apparently most chipotles only charge your an extra,We were so excited to find this chipotle in Vancouver ,I noticed the price seemed really high,What they made us was 1 tortilla with a small amount of melted cheese on it,only the melted cheese  ,we didn't get double cheese either ,do you just get 1 tortilla with a bit of melted cheese,The lady at the cashier did not even give me the time of day when I questioned why we were charged so much for melted cheese,It would be one thing to be charged an extra buck for melted cheese (if that is what you ordered) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had tacos,For that price you can get so many,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Serious food poisoning, All of us that got the medium-green salsa = NOT GOOD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you like the food here,Maybe the burrito is still filling,I can only taste one flavour - chipotle,just buy chipotle seasoning ,the portions have become kinda small (for the bowl anyway),I regret not getting a poke bowl now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Literally just had one of their burritos which was made by some dude who was half paying attention ,and burrito was cold,uneven spread burrito with all guacamole on the bottom,How hard is it to make a burrito,last time i go to any chipotle just for that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is okay for the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 This location is near my work so I visit it often and the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay burritos,It was a bit disappointing that for several times the person who was in charge of rolling the burritos had no idea how to do it right,way too stuffed burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fresh good food in huge,the burritos are usually not wrapped correctly (wouldn't really matter if they were- there's just too much,I recommend ordering a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eagerly ordered my usual and helped a friend pick their food,I ask if I may be allowed to eat my food then come back with the rest of the money,The food tastes fine I'm sure,nothing impressive about $12 for a burrito ,I could almost taste it,Sorry if I'd like my first taste of Chipotle in my hometown to NOT be cold ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unusual for a chipotle,**Good thing about this chipotle is their guac has no sour,Where are my black beans ,and I can't see my cheese,does have sour cream) so one star for that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I've had the burrito as well as the burrito bowl,but adds to price, Their daily made guacamole is so yummy,Fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The second problem this creates is that the ppl who put food in your meal,Thats all these people are trained to do just keep pushing the food down the line,So basicaly 11 dollars plus tax for 3 tacos,Also the meat was cold,Didnt it ever occur to keep the meat hot,Oh and if you want guacamole thatll be 2 dollars extras,You guys are missing a lot of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just some nerds eating burritos,and started to order my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito was okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My favorite burrito place in Vancouver for sure,It is a bit pricey but when you hold the burrito after its been made it ways a ton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here tastes very peculiar,Bad quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know about Mexican food,Chipotle has GREAT food,Not giving the 5th star be because in their rush they put lettuce when I asked not to and didn't listen when I asked for a second burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food has always been excellent,and the chips - always a hit ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
REALLY delicious food,their food quality is really good,it always tastes fresh,tasteless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is consistent,envious of my delicious burrito,I'm really big into getting chips when I get a burrito bowl,I love chipotle,so stale chips would be a nightmare,Never had stale chips from this location, the line always moves quickly and I don't notice a drop in quality of service or product,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I work on needham street in Newton so this is definitely a spot everyone must go every once in a while to satisfy that burrito craving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've worked in food service a lot ,delicious carnitas burrito as big,they were shorting people on beans and rice because they didn't seem to have enough,and cook some more rice or beans if you do,I ended up deciding to wait about 5 minutes for fresh beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
=) But the burritos are definitely smaller in size than the usual,typical of chipotle,Sometimes the next lady adds on a bit more when the other girl gave me too little meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food isn't that good, Bad rice ,cold meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've always liked chipotle and the food is pretty good,No wonder everyone in front of me were ordering bowls because nobody at this place knows how to roll a burrito,The kid who rolled my burrito obviously had no idea what he was doing ,"and told me to ""enjoy my sub burrito""",If you go here I'd just get a bowl or quesadilla or something unless you want to be wrestling a sloppy burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When we did eventually get our food,that I was also going to cover somebody else's burrito as well,The servers here were incredibly pushy and kept trying to argue with me that when I said I would cover my friend's tacos,from the meat to the rice,beans,Did enjoy the mildly spicy yet sweet corn salsa though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the meat and salsa are flavorless,except the chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The website doesn't mention it but there are often food shortages here,My burrito tasted pretty cruddy,the rice was underdone,no salsa the other,No guacamole today,Food and service quality has decreased significantly since opening,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their website touted usage of sustainably grown food,* food: lukewarm ,We ordered a carnitas bowl and a barbacoa burrito plus some drinks,* portion size: bowl was half the size represented on their website,* meat was tender ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so remember to add this one to your list as you run all over town getting free burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get the same thing: Chicken burrito,The burritos are huge,extra chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They use  clean organic ingredients - food with integrity - they don't have freezers,they do no compete to be authentic they are here to bring freshness and to change how we think about food,And yes there are a lot of special things about chipotle CLEAN food - no preservatives - naturally raise protein,For those who really don't understand the chipotle experience ,fresh real Mexican ingredients,and taste Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as well as some meat that had fallen into the bean,I noticed a ton of cheese shreds that had fallen into the guacamole container,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't visit a restaurant to be on mercy of how much the server wants to offer me food,I'm fan of chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
high quality food however,I'm sure certain ingredients run out from time to time,My opinion however is that the overall culture and quality is high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fresh food,Get the corn on anything you get here because the corn is seriously addictive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burrito was the size of a smart car but the chicken had many,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fresh,The food was packaged so that it stayed warm,I placed a catering order for a taco bar with Chipotle for a large,Everyone was very happy with the taco bar,It was very reasonably priced, and of high quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the quality and portion size of the food has decreased,When they first opened the burritos were full,I had  unripe pieces  of avocado in my guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We are so impressed with this chipotle location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I'll spare you my wasted burrito stories, Very kind staff and tasty meals with well seasoned ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the staff was horrendous- they were rude and it seemed as thought they were more interested in speaking to one another than finishing my food order,asked if she could focus on my burrito rather then laughing ,The only reason why I rated it w/ 4 stars was because of how good chipotle is,Needles to say I will be going back because I think chipotle is amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food is soo,bowl - more food than in a burrito or taco,mild salsa,and cheese,sour cream,With lettuce,Chipotle is renowned for using high quality and fresh ingredients,though I'm not expecting high quality Whole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great place for people that care about food,The burritos are big,I usually get the steak tacos with veggies,The steak has a little, and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My only complaint is that my boss likes his burrito bowl loaded with stuff ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
made-to-order with fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and have moved from hard shell tacos to the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in front of a group of people who were waiting for their food,""" He kept his gloves on and continued to prepare my gluten-free bowl after having touched a flour",00 for the same combination of ingredients at this Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good price,So delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but to be consistently out of something is not okay when people are still paying the same price,My wife had to ask him to go check for one of the two salsas they were out of ,and the guy came back huffing and puffing and threw the fresh salsa into its spot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is easily the slowest service chipotle I have ever been to,I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll get a burrito bowl,This particular chipotle is the worst location I have ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They screwed up my order twice and because they forgot to charge me for meat instead of veggie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All for a reasonable price,Fresh ingredients,it's delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place made me change my mind about Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My go-to order is the sofritas bowl,you get more in your bowl haha,It is pretty good in terms of portions and tofu tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and as some other reviewers have mentioned they significantly under fill burritos,I have been to this chipotle a few,times and I would say it's the worst chipotle I've ever visited,I found the ingredients to be dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband and I went to Chipotle for lunch it just opened and the mild salsa looked like it was left from last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 A bit skimpy on the meat compared to the US, I get corn,Twice they ran out of corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food, This specific location produces delicious burritos ,the affordable prices ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the food here,I can't finish my burrito,The only thing that kinda bothers me is that they don't have kids burritos,My son doesn't like the stuff that they have on the kids meals because he wants the burrito,I can honestly say I have never been disappointed when I choose chipotle,But who can pass up extra chipotle for leftovers,Their guacamole is perfection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's relatively expensive when you're paying $10 after tax for 3 tacos or a burrito,the chicken definitely seemed like the most appealing, option of the meats,Generally speaking - fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Looking at my partially filled bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My order was wrapped poorly and tasted bl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love this chipotle,the guacamole is never filled fully in the container,it is always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's Chipotle so the food is on par with the others,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best food ever,Best dish: steak tacos with guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito's are top,the chips ,and guacamole are awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is always fresh,the burritos are the size of a small, My favorite is the chicken fajita burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Although the restaurant may technically be ""fast-food""",it's about 5-10 minutes tops until you're in burrito heaven,the ingredients are much more fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We love Chipotle's food ,Server: Who's food is it,Asking for a tortilla in the bottom of the burritol bowl blew their mind, It's the same exact thing as a burrito,everyone that works there should know the difference between a flour and corn taco,Server: What kind of tacos,Moral of the story: Food was consistent with other chipotles (yummy) ,except in a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had the chicken burrito ,the just pointed to the box of burrito's ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any burrito is more than a pound,I'm not going to spend over $15 on a burrito combo ,The ingredients are high quality but mostly bland (except for the corn salsa,Bottom line: Chipotle uses quality ingredients ,but that does not make up for the bland taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I frequent chipotle at least three times a week ,Often times the rice is from the night before ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the food at Chipotle,Here you will experience the food that you can expect from a Chipotle,its delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle food is undoubtedly one of the better ones in terms if quality ,but for a food chain it has not been able,This particular location in Newton will stuff in a little more meat in your plate if you know someone behind the counter ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just went there again they alway skimp on all serving sizes in bowls or burritos I know the location is new,but come on get close to the other locations would be great also had to wait on rice over 5 min all other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have to constantly ask for more rice,then put half of it back into the bowl from which it came rather than in my dish,meat ,and the last time she scooped out a spoon of corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One star for the consistent tasty food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Sometimes it feels like it takes employees 12 minutes to make a burrito at other,"My only complaint is that employees get a little ""irritated"" if you ask them for more or less of something on your burrito/taco/bowl/salad",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was also overcharged on meat when I ask for a tad extra on one of my tacos,This is by far the worst chipotle I have been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
= cold food long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and my steak tacos were tasty,My daughter enjoyed her steak quesadilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the first time I've ordered from the chipotle in Winter Garden,I ordered via the chipotle as I always do ,The tea was soured and they gave me rotten guacamole ( I know guac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Have you ever had a bowl of Salt wi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the sodium was 2500mg for my chicken salad with no dairy, I always get a salad ,I used to really like eating here but I dont know if my taste buds have changed or if their recipe has changed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also had clearly listed in my order wanting chicken as the protein and there was none of it in my burrito bowl,Never had an issue with any chipotle locations until this one,The rice isn't even cooked,Thank goodness the chicken in my husbands bowl was cooked at least,Asked for extra lettuce and mild tomato salsa ,and literally had the smallest bunch of leafs and smallest scoop of salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The volume was quite filling but I did need to drink tons of water after getting home signifying that there was much MSG somewhere in the food- I suspect either the rice or meat,Tonight I was starving but the Barbacoa burrito I got with all the toppings just tasted st,Both ends of the burrito because of the folds was almost inedible-,not the meat not the hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love a steak or chicken burrito bowl,black beans,tomato and corn salsa,sour cream , topped with lettuce, No fast food can compare to the quality and fresh ingredients that Chipotle serves,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I have always loved chipotle,but what I love about the louisville chipotle the most,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was on par, though with what you expect from this delicious restaurant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is great, The place is clean and the food is good,I love chipotle, At this chipotle they fill the spoon ,Shake off half the meat back in the bowl, At other locations I receive more meat,The Longmont co location is better and gives more meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been to this chipotle twice this week both time the girl on the food line made my food wrong,I LOVE chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff was friendly and the food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fat burritos ,and plenty a red and green salsa filled us for the trek home to Bucks County,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
especially considering there's another chipotle less than 10 mins down the street,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I absolutely love the brand and the food ,we've never gotten the right food,I called to speak with a manager after our 2nd bad experience and he vowed to credit us for the missed food orders,but the vegetarians get meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great healthy gluten free option in a delicious burrito bowl,The portion is really too generous for what one can achieve in a single meal and I'd much prefer a smaller size and lesser price option however always make sure,The steak is always cooked to perfection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he loves his food,I made a little burrito to eat easier while feeding baby,I fed him the cilantro lime rice with a few,We all enjoyed the bowl with rice,but a lot of rice did end up in the floor under baby,One bowl was also enough for us to be full, bits of chicken ,and beans,beans,salsa,He also had the carnitas - extra meat on his tortilla,He also liked the avocado chunks in the guacamole ,and guacamole with a couple tortillas on the side,and shredded cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I think management needs to better address food quality ,I like chipotle generally , I recently tried going again last night and they ran out of white rice , Most got brown rice (including me) ,and I was horrified to find the rice was not cooked either ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and chicken tacos with mild,The chicken tacos had no cheese or sour,One vegan bowl w/hot,The vegan bowl was COVERED in cheese, salsa,and sour cream and mild salsa,and hot salsa,and sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now you've got your food,which is what matters here is that the one thing that stays consistent for the most part is the food,Overall good food,If you want guacamole as I'm sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is tasty,There are definitely a lot of options in the area for Mexican food ,and this isn't the top choice option but for the price it is a good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff didn't apologize over the lack of food safety ,I'm seriously considering flagging this incident to BC food safety authorities,the checkout label) buried within the rice,When asking for plain white rice - as I'm allergic,My veggie bowl came with the avocado label (yes,and said they'd make me a new veggie bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I go is a great experience and my food is always fresh,I've ordered it online and brought it home before and I've eaten at the store and the food is fresh,Overall I'm a huge chipotle fan no matter what ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Ordered a burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always running out of either queso or guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more authentic mexican food joints around towncharge significantly less,I usually get burritos here ,On my most recent visit I had a Carnitas burrito which I enjoyed,The other reason has to be price,I'm marking them down for two reasons: I ordered the Guacamole with chips,chips were decent,but guacamole was bland and tiny in proportion to the amount of chips you get,my meal came to about $16 with a drink and the chips/guac (I was hungry,$10 for a pretty basic salad is ridiculous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as chipotle goes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came by this chipotle again ,Never going back to this chipotle,I had ordered chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I saw some of the food being prepared in the few,I will most certainly be back and next time it will be for the food,I ordered a small fountain soda but they were out of small cups and told me they'd give me a large for the price of a small, minutes that I was there and it all looked good and smelled delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kudos to the kitchen for delicious food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything is heavy with salt and while everything appeared to be fresh the % of calories in a bowl or burrito must be astronomical,* Decent prices,I'm standing in line and there was a gorgeous spread of chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was more rice than actually veggies,I ordered a bowl to go ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
employee stirring rice had NO GLOVES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just ordered through door dash and my food was amazing, The bowl was packed with meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was ruined,Go hear if you want food poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have in numerous occasions missed items and bad quality of food, We were not prepared with masks and even the bowls were very small, even when we asked for extra salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food isn't always consistent at this location (nor is it anywhere else,the food quality was always above,I've watched 2 different employees dump the black beans onto my burrito without draining them first,Having a soggy burrito dripping with bean,Another issue I have is that the chips are often prepared,I've gotten bags of chips that aren't fully fried,The softness and sogginess of the chips isn't helped by the overload of salt that they've drowned the chips in after prematurely pulling them from the fryer,but just be weary when ordering chips, juice is not my idea of quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the cleanest and most efficient chipotle grill I've seen yet everything was fresh,even during the busy lunch hour unlike other chipotles this is probably the safe On,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chipotle on Needham street at 4:30pm on Saturday May 19th was filthy and the children and there was a rude girl serving food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can tell you that their food didn't disappoint me,I got a burrito with chicken ,Haven't tried chipotle before until now,Also got a side of chips ,and guacamole which was also really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle in grove,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steak tastes like dog treats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of them had food ,When you finally get to the counter they have run out of food,barely any lettuce because they ran out and passed my bowl down for next,I'll wait for lettuce,I ordered a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is because of 7+ employees I counted but only 2 working the food line,all in the same bowl,I ordered my usual: two sides of steak with a side of guac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ate there on Thursday and got food poisoning,rice, Had a bowl with chicken,and salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chips were stale, and the guacamole was brown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
spilling the food around,Employees just drop the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are huge,Typical chipotle,Food is fresh- love their steak and their guacamole is the best,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food even tastes better here compared to other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We come to this Chipotle quite regularly and find it to be a reliably consistent quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1 star because the food is consistent,05 for guacamole that I didn't order because I can't justify paying $2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Also why is there no consistency on the quality of chips,raw onion in the corn salad,Then I ask for 2 salad dressings ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My husband and I stopped on the way home last night to pick up burrito bowls, Forty minutes to get 2 burrito bowls, When we got home my steak was so burnt that I had to pick it out of my bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he didn't have to do any of this & I would've just been happy to just get my food delivered so I could watch the new,The manager explained to me that the rice I wanted was being made & was going to take 10-15min,I did tell him that I'd just have the other rice available,He then offered me a free chips & guac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would not order again from door-dash because the bowls are much smaller if ordered on-line,bowls also end up smaller for my smaller female, work partner even when ordering the same ingredients,affordable and freekin' tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food portions suck ,I remember when Chipotle had massive burritos ,and now they are small and not worth the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Chipotle staff and food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Either they've improved the quality of their food,or I somehow stumbled on to the exact right combination of ingredients in a bowl that happens to taste good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
& skipped Pico & lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At Howe street they are just rude and give the stingiest portions I have ever got at a chipotle in the US ,The service I have received at Broadway location is far superior and I always get a full bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm a huuuuge chipotle freak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pros: Fresh food,I never feel groggy after eating the burritos here,Chicken with brown rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I order 2 bowls ,It took nearly 20 mins to get my 2 basic chicken bowls made,and after I paid it turns out only one bowl was in my bag,When I asked for my 2nd bowl,they pointed to a bowl ,"The bowl said ""Big","I replied ""that's not my bowl""","that's your bowl""","He yelled at the guy in the back ""where is the chicken bowl",they opened up the one labeled big daddy and it turns out it WAS my bowl,Not before hearing the person who was named Big daddy start yelling at the cashier that he has been waiting for 30 mins for his bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is no hygiene when it comes to making food,Lots of cross contamination and they just splatter the ingredients into the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good solid burrito made quickly,If you like your burritos short,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the to go place for me to eat but idk why they serve so little food this time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is nothing close to Mexican food,the food is alright,grass-fed and local foods,I'm often surprised by how much sour cream they use,It's a LOT and I love sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is pretty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They didn't have any ingredients to make my food so I asked for a refund,they were relieved that they didn't have to make me a burrito so they could continue cleaning,Avocado is way too overpriced,If it's late in the day expect the salsa to run out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came in earlier in the week because I wanted tacos,they had too many catering orders and were out of taco shells ,I decided to try again for tacos,they were out of taco shells again,and they were waiting on lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because I was really scared when I asked the guy at the end of assembly line of burrito as he gave me NASTIEST look for asking to cut the burrito in half,I was not going to be able to finish the giant burrito sitting there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To be fair I got home and ate my burrito anyway because by that point I was too tired,Today was the second time I made a mobile order and didn't get the guacamole I ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is my favorite chipotle by far,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont know what these reviews r talking about the servers are all incredibly nice and the food is fresh,the one time they were out of the rice i wanted my meal was free,and delicious l,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I guess there is zero effort that goes into any sort of quality control despite asking for a double wrap burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also their burrito rolling is half fast,They also did a great job rolling the burrito,and/or full serving of chicken with full,I'll start off by saying this location has skimped me so many times on double meat, serving of steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is great,The food was really good,I waited in line for the 'next person' to complete my bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Huge burrito made the way you like it,The burrito bowl is a cleaner-to-eat,alternative to the burrito,It has the same options for rice/beans/etc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bad quality/food preparation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the food ,Today I've waited 20 minutes in store for one burrito bowl after placing an online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tacos mostly empty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Mexican food,but unfortunately Vancouver doesn't offer memorable Mexican food unlike in the neighboring,   It's a food court style no-frills, The food is fresh,you basically make all the decisions on what you want in your burrito/bowl, I usually get the chicken brown rice bowl with beans,lettuce with guacamole as a side (It is $2 extra)total comes to 11,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and food always cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks for making my burrito bowl with a mountain of sour,When my roommate made an order online they forgot the meat and salsa in the burrito bowl,Worst chipotle ever,The rice was also overcooked ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And as far as the food goes,it's chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I can understand that with high volume they need to cook some food in advance , Maybe put it in the dining area so the customers can heat up their cold food, Nobody wants COLD meat in a burrito, The chicken ,and steak here are consistently cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Have friendly customer service and generous on amount of food portion they give out  nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've worked at a chipotle for years ,To add to this the guacamole was brown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food was yummy,but today when I went in and got my usual burrito bowl,This is typically my go-to chipotle ,but then scraped off all of my guacamole and corn salsa in the process,The girl worker then glared at me again as she scooped my guacamole into my Bowl,the girl at the end of the line put lettuce in without me asking to,When I told her I hadn't asked for lettuce,so I just told her that I really didn't like lettuce,but was just really confused why the girl treated me that way when I hadn't asked for lettuce in the first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always a consistent place for good eats that fills you up for a decent price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burrito, You can customize your meal whether it is a bowl or burrito,This is a authentic Mexican grille which specializes in rice bowls, You can customize your meal whether it is a bowl or ,All ingredients are fresh and the meat is cooked perfectly cooked/seasoned,and salads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you like spicy food,I didn't mind at the time since it was a to-go order and I was already home when I checked the food,I mean for an $8 bowl you don't even get everything you ask for,it has a nice mix between spicy and being flavorful (the lettuce tones down the spiciness a little,for some reason the lettuce was like sprinkled on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been to this chipotle twice this week both time the girl on the food line made my food wrong,I LOVE chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered my burrito bowl with white,rice,Totally lacking on my chicken portion rice ,half chicken/half steak ,Totally lacking on my chicken portion  ,literally three small pieces of chicken,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
received their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I do enjoy a good Chipotle bowl,so all of my bowls end up tasting the same,They take pride in the quality of their ingredients, (delicious nonetheless),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We were told upon being in line that they were all out of - chicken, The person working said they only had steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lady who made my burrito was nice,my burrito wasn't bad,She appeared to be in a bad mood and didn't want to be bothered when I inquired about additional tortilla chips for my queso ,The chips were cold,and guacamole,making the lukewarm queso and guacamole unenjoyable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered online so I could shop and just pick up food on my way home,At around 8:05pm finally recieved my food,Will never go to this chipotle again,and will never use online ordering at any chipotle again,When i got home my daughter's order had chicken ,In my bag of chips i had 2 pieces of plastic in it,and not steak as i ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast food,For a $10 burrito in Vancouver,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle has been going down in quality over the past,I was given the bare minimum amount of each topping and had to keep asking to get a tiny bit more of rice,beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 These employees will likely be working at chipotle for the rest of their lives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I've been ordering from this location and my food is delivered consistently incorrectly,and upon opening the three meals I ordered- *all three* contained heaping amounts of white rice instead of brown,rice like I requested,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taste exactly like it should and clearly the management is doing a good job maintaining the quality of food ,My boyfriend and I choose this chipotle every time,Portion sizes are great and the quality is amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I eat chipotle 4-5,times per week and somehow the worst chipotle in the country is less than 2 miles from my house,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Just wish there was a burrito place in the 02465 area code,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food decent ,I've learned the hard way that for online orders you need to specify a pick-up time 30 to 45 minutes ahead of when you intend to pick up in order to have any chance that your food will be ready,I've had to wait close to an hour on one ocassion to get food that I pre-ordered well in advance,other times you get a nearly empty bowl or burrito,and price fair,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food has been great,I noticed the guy taking orders had just finished starting a burrito made with a flour,I usually get a bowl and decided to branch out and get tacos,Knowing he was going to pick up the taco shells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
napkins and straws and never once helped me I ended up walking out without my food after spending probably about 25 minutes in the restauran,I was in chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've ordered a lot of chipotle in my time,Two stars is because I love chipotle ,I ordered a chicken bowl with brown rice,barely any tomato salsa and hardly any rice,I just ordered it via door dash and it's probably the worst bowl I've ever ordered,Since when is it okay to charge $9 for a half bowl,and chicken,I had six pieces of chicken,tomato salsa,corn salsa,sour cream,lettuce,I did get a lot of lettuce though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Being rushed at chipotle to order is a given,I asked if the beans were vegetarian,I said no are the beans vegetarian he ignored,I asked are the beans made from,Pork or are they vegetarian he then said yea you can have meat,if your not serving lettuce (due,Since 3 other people in the line began to order then after realized there was no lettuce ,However I've asked what I wanted I said a vegetarian salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The limp-wristed girl dishing the food provided the most pathetically small,rice ,I was given less than a half a spoonful of each: beans,And they were out of sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I only had about 1/3 of a chicken burrito (double, meat) filled with brown rice,There was actually so much chicken that it kind of overpowered all of the other flavours and the ratio of rice to beans was also quite off,was extremely pleased with the flavours of the chicken,black beans,lettuce and salsa,cheese,the hype is real and delicious at that with huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What is terrible about this location is that they can't wrap a burrito,Chipotle has good meat and quality salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tomato salsa,guacamole, Main line was missing corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I even watched them read the slips and place the ingredients but when you open the bowl there is a different, meat or it's missing one or more items,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One for takeout and food delivery (skip the dishes ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I have seen it many nights I grab food,I have had some food not the greatest some nights ,patient and understanding of the whole situation realizing it isn't just your food they are making,I have always had a pleasant experience in this Specific chipotle ,"People say Wrong ingredients in things that are actually supposed to have the said ""wrong",""" ingredient in them or missing ingredients that Chipotle doesn't even use",BTW Lately the proteins have tasted really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but lucky for them I took my food to go,I guess I'll just have to pay more attention to the clowns making my food ,I took 3 bites of my burrito before I realized that the CHICKEN WAS BARELY COOKED,I took my burrito bowl to go,when I got home and opened up the burrito bowl I definitely thought someone had already taken 5 huge,rushing through the burrito topping process ,It's bad enough that I'm already paying out the woz for an overpriced burrito,and make sure they put a normal serving of rice,only to discover at home that they barely filled the bowl with the toppings I asked for,chicken,beans,salsas,cheese,and lettuce instead of the half-sized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Does Chipotle training not include learning how to properly close lids for bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was craving a steak burrito so I placed an online,My burrito was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food seems like not the freshest at I had to choose from the bottom of the tray,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My family loves not only the wonderful food ,This chipotle is one of the best chipotle's I have been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great food,I got to this chipotle at 9:58 PM (they close at 10:00),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast service - Old chips & cold(er) food,I mean i know how delicious they can be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the second time chipotle forgot some our order ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is delicious,They are so helpful with our special requests and always check to make sure our food looks good,always looks and tastes so fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The steak was raw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jesus came from behind the food prep the first,I explained to him my food issues (no gluten) ,that I have had a problem with my food,I have probably picked up food here hundreds of times over the past,I know when to avoid rush crowds when possible and if the food might not be up to par or a completely unknown,I will be happy to come in and have a chicken bowl anytime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as I try to not fuel a company who has so many issues in terms of the quality and health issues with their food - as well as ethics,I got a burrito ,My burrito had such,little rice and protein that more than half the bites of burrito were just tortilla,the burrito was $9,In addition to the burrito,I got chips ,The serving size doesn't even serve 1 - as you have far more chips than you do queso,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Chipotle customers deserve better than to have some miserable person serving their food to them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also u can pre order your food if u,Food tastes fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are very messy and they use rotten lettuce in the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their ideals and their food,the people that cook/serve the food,maybe a half a scoop of rice,i had to ask for more rice for both bowls,She ordered a veggie bowl ,I ordered a chicken bowl,open up my bowl ,and maybe 10 pieces of lettuce - the two most pitiful bowls I have ever seen,6 pieces of chicken,She wanted both beans ,one pinto beans,and chips,And not to mention - the chips at this location suck,just plain boring dry tortilla chips - everytime i go,a couple shreds of cheese ,and maybe a tablespoon of sour cream,and i wanted extra lettuce,and there is legit 7 pieces of lettuce,and a little bit of lettuce - i asked for extra,lettuce on both,then they piled on tomatos and corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was no reason for him to act this way towards us and not even acknowledge or apologize for the quality of food we received last,The food was good,A week ago my boyfriend and I got two Carne Asada bowls to go,When we got home and ate our bowls the steak was chewy,they would replace our bowls,Today my boyfriend and I went back to get our bowls with our receipts ,(They never once apologized for the inconvenience or for the fact that their meat was overcooked) I asked for the name of the manager I spoke to ,I called and complained about the quality of the steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice,I would have taken a picture if I wasn't busy licking the bowl clean,chicken,Everything was fresh : lettuce,so I haven't really had the taste for Chipotle in months,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The adult meal bowl issues ranged from missing ingredients to NO LETTUCE in the Salad Bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was my very first time getting Chipotle and I was soooo excited to try their burritos,It was my turn to order and the girl asked me what I would like and I said burrito ,and she said ok and then she asked me what kind of rice I wanted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've kept ordering here because of its proximity to work but the food quality here is just horrendous,Why is the food quality so consistently poor,brown and awful guac that just ruins the bowl,Stale chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food all looked fresh,someone came out and asked how our food tasted ,I ordered a burrito with pinto,chicken,The beans and chicken had a great, beans,The beans ,fresh tomato salsa,corn salsa,guacamole,and fresh cut lettuce, and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We asked for 5 bowls ,They also threw/slid the bowls ,They also don't even serve the bowls correctly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yesterday I placed my usual order of chicken tacos with crispy shells,When I got home 10 minutes later what little chicken was in the tacos was cold,The taco shells were a soggy,"I paid $14 for a crappy ""taco salad",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited for 9 minutes before my food was ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ten years of delicious burritos ,I've been a regular customer of chipotle since 2010,-Slimy rice ,and bowls,-Forget ingredients EVERY time I've ordered online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If I could give a -0 start I would right now we just order some take out form here and let me start you guys got one JOB and I feel like y'all disappointed everything in our order was wrong and even missing food is so frustrating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have on many occasions enjoyed a comparable burrito elsewhere for half the price,Of the 7 or eight half-inch cubes the attendant has successfully scooped into my bowl or onto my tortilla,"and the ""steak"" here is entirely indigestible",They treat lettuce as a garnish rather than an ingredient,One entree should not be nearly so complicated as to forget the two ingredients I asked for about six seconds ago,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the rudest chipotle I've ever been to,We will not be returning to this chipotle solely because of him ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what other areas of safe food h,I know that you can remove your facial covering while consuming food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm giving 2 stars because the food is still delicious,the server just quickly sealed my burrito bowl,so of course I said tortilla chips & guac (,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got the tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We order 3 bowls one with chicken one with stk ,and one with barbcoa   Chicken had chicken the stk had 4 pieces ,Neither one had 2 kinds of beans like order in fact hardly any,and the other had one small sliver of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They send the guac/salsa without the chips,The past two times I've ordered they don't provide chips that I've paid for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worker left the line with a half made burrito ,Worst chipotle experience I've ever had,1 worker on the line while 5 other workers sat in the corner ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle has awesome food,It is delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and poor burrito rolling,Overall this is the worst chipotle I've ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was ordering a burrito ,When that person ordered hard tacos the employees realized they were out of hard,tacos so they called to the back for more ,but there was a wait for white rice so I told the next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this happens to be with a national & successful food chain & they are being proactive,I was able to ask some of my daughter's friends (including some pre-med babies) who devour chipotle on a regular,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"waiting 45 minutes for ""fast"" food is a little",When I did finally get my food,a steak burrito bowl that had been as carelessly thrown together as slop in in a trough,it was maybe a touch over room temperature and the chips were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is ALWAYS fresh,it's true there are many times the line is (literally) out the door BUT that's because the food is great, A burrito bowl will feed me (well) at lunch ,relatively healthy (skip the burrito skin , and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The short lady serves you only half portions of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" And I am NOT laboring under the delusion that Chipotle is a ""Mexican food"" restaurant (news flash: neither are Moe's or Willy's)", at least it TASTES like food," I know it's not ""real"" Mexican food","and I'm not even sure it's ""real"" food at all","but if you order the ""burrito bol"" (a burrito without its massive", Their meat and beans taste fresher ,and more flavorful than their counterparts at Willy's and Moe's as does the mild tomato salsa (which is actually pico, And their guac is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a chicken burrito with guacamole on Saturday night,I will never eat at any chipotle ever again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Purchased a bowl with various vegetarian food,Many food choices were not readily available, During the restocking some of the food was being scooped,with utensils that did not appear to be clean and food was takken from ,previous buckets that were cold and the food who knows the condition if, I looked at the vomit and it was the exact food from Chipotle,I did Not consume any other food that evening except Chipotle,It was chipotle food the cause,No meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the food ,and feel sure I will be back to stand in line to get a chicken burrito bowl, I love the quality meats and veggies and the rice is delicious, They are not stingy with the ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ask for light rice ,and beans with peppers to keep it from falling on my lap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I eat at chipotle way too much,fast chipotle location,Everything is as expected with the chain (delicious),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
) I went today and declined rice,when I normally order a salad with no rice,I was served significantly less meat/veggies/beans than the person before ,I get more meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 By the time we got to our table our food was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't like rudeness people who reach over my food bu,if u as a paying customer and u ask 4 fresh food u,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Saw one worker touch anything and everything in the back with the same plastic gloves she was using to prepare the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
long line and meh food,But after waiting in line for almost half an hour I'm eating a cold burrito ,My review is purely of this chipotle,I love love love most chipotle's,This chipotle always has a super,long line and is the worst chipotle I have ever been too,I avoid this chipotle like the plague now,and my husband's steak is alarmingly raw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was cold,Got a burrito bowl ,and a bag of chips,New chips were just as stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a busy area and as any other chipotle it's busy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why are you chips so bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can feel at least a bit reassured that the food I'm eating hasn't been sitting frozen,I think their burritos are damn good,"Maybe it's not the most ""authentic"" burrito you'll ever eat",I really love the cilantro-lime rice,The chicken is always fantastic,the meat never feels stringy or of subpar,The ingredients are delicious, quality like some Boston chains I can think of,it tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a burrito ,This place is terrible and very disappointing compared to other chipotles,Bag of chips was half empty,and got half portions of all the ingredients - very stingy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As much as I love rice ,and beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of food seems below normal,they do give more food per burrito than anywhere else,I love chipotle,but this is a terribly run chipotle location,and I am used to and fine waiting in the huge chipotle lines ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The new people are more friendly and can wrap a burrito ,and they did lowered the price on guacamole but never going in for a burrito,Get a burrito bowl ,and ask for a second scoop of rice,beans everything beside meat ,and guacamole to get your moneys worth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is fresh,in that it is the one I usually go to--the chicken has only been weird,I admit that I always get two sides of chicken with guac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My favorite thing to order is a burrito bowl - steak,the same people prepared the burritos that were ordered over phone/fax/online ,black beans,mild AND hot salsa,and definitely cheese,some sour cream,lots of lettuce,The thing I like about Chipotle is that it uses minimal ingredients,There is something to say about astounding my taste buds on very little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is relatively cheap, (7-8 dollars for a burrito) ,and it's always a very big burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food will probably still taste amazing with the spoon though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is by far the worst chipotle location I have ever been to,I still come here occasionally on my breaks because I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While their food is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
knowing the meats are ethically sourced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I normally get a veggie fajita burrito,Of all the burrito joints,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can always ask for more rice/beans/salsa,and the steak could be cooked a bit more medium than well done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very stingy with the amount of food they give you,Normally Chipotle is known for the vast amount of food you get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a chicken burrito with guacamole on Saturday night,I will never eat at any chipotle ever again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and seems like more food than a burrito,A burrito bowl with tortillas on the side is cleaner,I like to get double meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the food was mediocre,one guy making my burrito ,I'd rather support a local taqueria or taco truck than this place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ingredients were all fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I decided to try it after hearing all the hype about their burritos,I had the chicken burrito,which just makes it weird in a mission-style burrito,And it makes up at least 75% of the burrito,The chick rolling my burrito did a pretty crap job of rolling it too,for a mediocre burrito ,2/5 could make better burritos while pooping on the toilet,Effing mediocre and over-priced,And the rice,Oh god the rice, It's like this weirdly plain white rice with cilantro,the chicken was over cooked,The cheese was honestly the best part,Not to mention the tortilla tastes like cardboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,several tables had food debris,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
five chips in the kid's chip bag,The guacamole vat was brown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but for some reason when I ask for white rice,they put brown rice in my bowl,It's like they don't understand me not wanting brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As for the food,I'm surprised by all of the bad reviews I have read about this chipotle because of their bad,I have been to this chipotle 3 times now ,it was chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just wanted to say that I really enjoy Chipotle and they make great food,I asked for a side of sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prices are high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well I paid for a bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am impressed with the cleanliness UNTIL I observe a man handling food push down on the trash contents with his bare h,My family likes a chipotle dinner once in a while,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food is great,and you can't beat that price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then the bowl I ordered they did ok with,I ordered a cheese quesadilla ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get a chicken burrito bowl ,But was surprised when I visited this location that the burrito bowl didn't taste like the bowls at the 8 other, chipotle locations I've visited,Not sure if it's the rice,chicken,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get the burrito bowl with chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spending $7+ on a burrito,the person making my burrito really skimped on the meat,I want as much for my money as I can get-- and a small handful of rice ,and chicken,I'd like for it have a good amount of the ingredients I am looking for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food never disappoints,black beans and lime rice with a side of chipotle sauce) for under $4 that's both filling ,I love that I can get a simple healthy meal (vegetarian salad: lettuce,and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Mexican food , Maybe it's the chicken, The steak is always very very chewy, I know it's a chain store so the taste doesn't differ too much,it doesn't taste as good, But it doesn't taste bad, No Chipotle has ever tasted bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But after we ordered our food,I was taken aback when I saw her spoon a small scoop of chicken over my burrito bowl,I LOVE the chipotle Tabasco they offer at Chipotle,When they ran out of cheese,It looks like they use freshly grated cheese,They had us waiting over 10 minutes for cheese with no compensation afterward,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They'll throw beans on your burrito just because they feel like it,You hate beans,If you order chips ,and guacamole,I shouldn't have to perform a quality assurance assessment every time I walk in to your restaurant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was very impressed at how smooth their food line was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and the ""bowls"" are a pretty good pick if McMexican food isn't your thing",The best thing about my burrito was that it kept my h,rice,chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their patio makes for a nice place to get some food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not burritos,They were out of burrito lettuce,Probably the worst chipotle location I've ever been to,Had to ask three times for extra cheese,I was informed that the lettuce was for salads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  This is a food establishment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
staff was thoughtful enough to leave my food in oven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Upon getting to the counter I could see that they were being skimpy on some foods for the person in front of me (I think they were about out of a meat or two), But to the point I ordered chicken burrito bowl with a side of chips , I feel ok about paying that much for my dinner because my guy doesn't like chipotle so it is a great,)  In the bag is a very skimpy portion of chips for my guac (hey chipotle I paid you a pretty crazy,price for just a layer of chips on the bottom of bag),you have jacked up the prices ,and are skimping down on what I am paying you more for)  Then I open my bowl ,but skimpy as well and the chicken was really dry,and not the usually tasty chicken I remember,but I won't be racing back to this location anytime soon and if I do I am going to ask for a larger portion of chips for my gauc,but if I pay over 3 bucks for chips ,and gauc I should get a third of that bag of chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A couple months ago I went to this Chipotle and while eating my burrito bowl I unfortunately realize that I am chewing on a bay leaf that was not taken out of whatever they used it in to cook,as I was eating my burrito bowl from this chipotle again for the first,I take a fork full of the bowl only to pull out an long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are a select few that can wrap the burritos ,Employees actually give you the proper amount you go to chipotle for,They consistently short you on all the ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As a loyal customer I have to say that this place is really inconsistent with their food,the chips are stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 From stale chips to over cooked, I have held back from a comment for many months but I think the consistency proves the quality is severely lacking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didn't enjoy their food because nothing tasted like they usually do from other,They didn't have any of the original salsa,so used the hot salsa instead which made it disgusting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dirtyy but the food was okayish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only 2 starts bc the food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is ALWAYS great, Chicken tacos are the best as a great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was a hefty,they gave me chips (I love the hint of lime) with each side order of guacamole and salsa, portion for my size and tasted fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The steak tacos with the cilantro white, rice is by far my favorite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mostly out of desperation for a burrito fix,Rice is luke warm at best and not a good matched flavor to a burrito,What you end up with is a burrito that can be mostly cold,unless you were having lettuce or tomato and for god sakes that's not a burrito,here's how I can approximate something halfway decent  for a burrito:,some times i will grab the tobasco of choice and hand it to them and ask them to put it on the INSIDE of the burrito while they are making it,one day they gave me a free burrito because they could not guess what i had ordered after is was made (one person writes on the foil what it is so the cashier can ring it up,right after they opened I was there late and did not like my burrito,they sent me a free burrito coupo,that's a taco,"black beans
rice","
salsa of choice",The cheese is thrown on cold,with cold cheese,Ask them to put the cheese on first so the hot,"for example: melt the cheese "" we have no way to do that"" um","so so steam the tortilla and melt the cheese that way"" steaming degrades tortillas"" was the response",ingredients go on top ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prices are high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Slowest chipotle I've ever been to,charged for double meat ,when I didn't order double meat),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food line or the seating/condiment,the chips for the chips ,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
until news of food quality concerns became public,and frankly I love the food there ,I don't ever complain about my food so I took the replacement , After paying for my bowl,They offered to remake the bowl,I noticed a flattened fly on the top piece of my lettuce,sans lettuce ,they didn't even remove the lettuce bin where they just pulled it from,though there's clearly some quality issues present,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I was starving and since they weren't actually landing on the food," Why am I being charged extra for guac at a place that serves ""Mexican"" food",You know its all about those burrito bowls,There was a fly flying around in the area where they prep your bowl,95 for guacamole, I will probably never request guacamole again, I can only image how much a margarita would cost if they charge you $2 extra for guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The meat is poorly seasoned ,if you like romaine lettuce there's a good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only negative thing that I could give chipotle is that the customer service discrepancy between locations,There is literallly nothing better that chicken and rice for me,Most of the time I get the salad bowl with carnitas,green salsa,corn salsa,mild salsa ,Everything works well and tastes delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But that is more due to the location - this area could support another big-burrito chain - the newest is the Qdoba ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
   previous: OK if I ever get another burrito like I got Mon its DEFINITELY bumping up to 5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The server is always very friendly and nice and the food always comes out delicious,Love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service is always great and they definitely load my bowl with a ton of food,I definitely go with a burrito bowl with a tortilla laid out inside of it,The carnitas are so yummy delicious ,and I just tried the barbacoa which I found to be really delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really wish there was another chipotle in the Smyrna/ Vinings area,How do you run out of salad dressing AND chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was great,The rice was soft, the meat was tender and the chips are salty :) The place was clean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I love the burritos, I've gotten brown rice before in an attempt to be healthier, I love the chicken , The key for me is that I get the hot salsa , That way you get the hot salsa ,and then put sour cream and cheese in it,and the cool sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm being charge the same as every other chipotle but I'm getting less food,I got a burrito bowl ,Worst chipotle I've ever been to,and there wasn't enough rice to even cover the bottom of the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like they were at the bottom of the pan and someone scraped it up and threw it on my burrito,Burrito had two SMALL pieces of steak that were dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As far as the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- undercooked rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location has the freshest food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all the ingredients are so fresh and its a lot of food for the money,My goto item is always a burrito bowl,as a recently converted vegan I find its the easiest thing to put together a vegan bowl that's quite healthy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  Had to ask for more rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was also what looked like a contractor standing right in the food area talking to a worker about something that clearly didn't need discussed in the food area,They were out of the green salsa ,AND the hot salsa ,I get all of the salsa besides mild for bulk ,Completely disappointing as someone who can't have dairy (so no cheese or sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are very busy but they always have good food,Sometimes I go here for lunch and get a burrito,I usually get it wuth chicken ,but I think you can also get it with steak or whatever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The last time I ate here I got food poisoning ,There is always a long line which gives the impression theyre handing out free burritos,My boyfriend got chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My partner and I frequent the food trucks,Plus they have the chipotle Tabasco sauce,Their cilantro-lime rice is so yummy,so everything tastes even better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I called the restaurant to inform them of the hair in my food ,I am beyond disgusted with the food ,As I bit into my burrito  there was a long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was hot,It would make the food SO much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
been sticking with Willys for my burrito fix for now, I've eaten there twice recently and the chicken had hard,but the quality has gone down hill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I find the food to be cold,not even lukewarm- they sure need a more efficient way of keeping their hot ingredients hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food is great as you would expect at any chipotle, I didn't think chipotle would have a margarita that good,But this is your average good chipotle,And there was a protesting group that came inside yelling about meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In terms of food,I really liked this chipotle chain for its size,my only complain would be that their guacamole was a bit different,I think the chain manager really needs to do something about their guacamole though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered food online,a chicken fajita bowl that arrived at my door with no chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Each of the food pods had other,food in them,I opted for the guac and chips,I mean DISGUSTING and it was full of corn,The young lady was beating the spoon more than normal but I didn't think I was getting tasteless puddy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LOVE chipotle,white rice,My usual: chicken fajita bowl,no beans,mild salsa,hot salsa on the side,guacamole ,cheese,sour cream,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I purchased chipotle around 1:45pm by 3:00pm I was vomiting all over the floor at work with a hurting tummy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Ours had smears of food on it,The food was good, My problem was that I had soft tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Skimpiest burrito bowl I've ever seen, Even one of the line workers questioned the amount of meat in it to the person before him ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,I must not be the only person that is happy with the food here, and the chips are house made ,The meats are nicely seasoned ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The black beans ,and the guacamole were each soooo salty that I had to throw away my meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice,I walked in expecting a normal meal that consists of beans,and a cup of salsa- a meal that normally costs me $2,I paid $3 for a half cup of salsa,now it's debatable that I could have declined the salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quick Mex-ish food,Their meats tend to be a bit spicier than the competition (such,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trashy people serving trashy food,They charge hefty prices for drinks ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It doesn't get much better than a burrito bowl from Chipotle,quality ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only do they make amazing burritos,If you don't like chipotle then you're not human,I place my order and pay on the chipotle app (you can pay in person ass well),I absolutely love chipotle,I love the brown rice,but the bowls are equally great,chicken ,Top it off with some cheese and salsa,The ingredients always taste fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" I like to order the ""bowls"" which are actually a burrito without a wrap around it",and reasonably priced, They go a bit crazy with the cheese ,and sour cream so you might want to ask them go light, More taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Garbages were overflowing and food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hands down my favorite chipotle location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Long lines are nothing new for this chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and get me even more excited than I knew possible to devour my burrito bowl,or having one-on-ones with employees over burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I could have had a restaurant cook my food faster,I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a sofritas burrito ,So I got my burrito ready,to sit down and dive into Chipotle goodness when the way my burrito was wrapped was just horrible,It was more of a soft taco than a burrito,Luckily I took a fork just in case and ate out of it like a fiesta bowl,but then changed my mind to chicken after finding out it was pork,green salsa,and extra sour cream (which they seemed to be two small dollops) then guacamole,My guacamole ,and tear drops of sour cream went more into the foil wrap then to me,I give it three stars because it tasted pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My chicken burrito was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id eat half of this bad boy and then pass out for the next 7 hours due to foodcoma,The burrito they serve here is smaller than a 99 cent burrito at taco bell, With the burrito here,ok not really but damn the size difference is definitely noticeable here compared to the chipotles back in california,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe someday when I grow up I'll stop loving fast-food burrito bowls,I love the convenience (I literally pass by everyday on my way to work) and the price (yeap I still feel like a poor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I used to go to New Albany but their food tastes terrible,so I tried this location and the food here was AMAZING,They constantly stir their food,keeping food all hot,Their food is always clean,Also if ask for extra meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but They hooked my burrito up so much,Food was fresh but the meat wasn't too warm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is consistently 2/3-1/2, portion of other chipotles,I love chipotle,I got a chipotle gift card as a reward from credit to eat more of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fantastic food ,because it is a fabulous place to stop for fresh food while travelling,My kids love the kids tacos,I love the taco salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the food no complaints,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a rice and chicken burrito,I usually get the same thing every time I go to chipotle,95 and I know this again because I get the same exact thing every time at every chipotle location I go to,This time I was charged extra for asking for a little bit more rice,I was told because I asked for a little bit more rice I was charged for double,rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pretty good food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As I move along the line they also don't have crunchy tacos,The girls that have me al this info ofcourse all young looked at me like I was totally wrong for wanting what are usual ingredients in my ChipotLe taco,Love chipotle,First they didn't have cilantro in their rice,The meat ,But service and lack of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In terms of food quality ,this is the best chipotle in Columbus,And their chicken is best in Columbus in terms of look ,Their guacamole is consistently fresh,and taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food lacked flavor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location never skimps on the meat or cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I have eaten a lot of chipotle before ,4oz of chicken they say on a salad bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like just picking up my order and avoiding the stares and and side eye glances from the employees that look like they are tired or irritated from dipping stuff into a bowl or tortilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no pork okay they like local and all nstur as long but no salad dressing why bother serving salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good food, I have never seen a woman chopping or preparing food in the back,I will continue to go here because the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They ran out of rice ,I don't even have full menu options and in paying full price for an item,and wouldn't even substitute it for guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Considering the cost and the taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Having to wait in long lines for fatty steak,and poor quality ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food has been consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They always seem to run out of food too,Nothing wrong with the food except stop running out of chips,One of them doesn't know how an assembly line works because she did everything without passing my burrito bowl down to the next,give me meat and rice ,All I wanted was chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love eating at chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This has got to be the WORSE chipotle EVER, This wont hinder my chipotle experience at other,stingy on the rice , Even when I ordered double steak on the phone i got single,and lettuce, Then to skip out on the corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted off,The taco shells tasted plastic like,The chicken was really off as well,The chips were soggy,Please please please do a quality check , and tasted either not fried,everything just didn't taste as good,I was also starving coming back from a mtn trip and would've eaten anything but this I couldn't even finish because the taste was so completely off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Much cleaner than the Cleveland Circle one and because its busy all the time the food is fresher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,And every time and each person chances de amount of food that they put,and the price even better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 A bean and cheese burrito is $2 which I'm fine,"I had 1-scoop of hot sauce and it becomes $5 because it's a ""3-point"" burrito",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can understand the line moving slowly at lunch or dinner time but there can be four people in line and it takes just as long to get your food as it does during peak rush,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cilantro in the rice,Overpriced guac,Salty meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was impressed to see the same prices in MCO as a Chipotle back at home,Burrito bowl , Food quality is what I would expect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like it because u get to pick exactly what you want in your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1) Assemblage of the food products, The gentleman in front of me ordered a regular burrito, I think this burrito h,andler could benefit from some remedial burrito rolling lessons,and the salsas were as fresh, And I felt lucky when I saw that they had run out of guac and had to top off my salad with guacamole from a new, And THEN I had to pay $2 extra for guacamole,and the second person on the assembly line made a real mess of it while she tried to roll it up - bean juice and sour cream squirting out of the bottom as she squished ,very careful to only scoop a tiny blob of guac onto my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Better portions than the chipotle in Westborough or Marlborough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually go for the chicken burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if your a burrito lover like I am,but something about the spicy Chipolte burritoes ,BIG burrito to satisfy ur, Seems every time I come in here they are cooking up a fresh batch of grilled chicken, I'm still a big cheese dip fan which they dont have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After standing in like for 40 minutes we were ready to order our food ,When we ate our food at home,So my boyfriend and I LOVE chipotle,And sad to say it was definitely the worst chipotle we ever had,it was the smallest bowl I have ever had from chipotle,We'll see if I get a craving for chipotle so bad,Not to mention the rice was really dry,We both wanted bowls with black,The bowls usually last,And the chicken was very dry, beans,They were out of black beans ,They said that they were all out of black beans until their next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 this is my football food,Give me a carnitas burrito with rice,One burrito from here is about half,I just up my exercise regimen to fit in with my love of football and diet-crushing burritos,very rarely the people putting together the burrito slop stuff on there that you don't even want before you even tell them what you want so,Once they get going on a burrito making roll they are in their own,burrito zone where everyone's burrito should have sour,Stand up for your burrito,black beans,green salsa,and guacamole ,I love Chipotle and I am not the type of girl to get a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the atmosphere and Next time I will be getting the burrito bowl,Had the beef tacos,I didn't know tacos could be so juicy,Fresh ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While the food is not going to change your worldview on Mexican food,the ingredients in your food will be fresh,they offer an online nutrition calculator to help determine the calories and nutrients in your food as well,quality product,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is amazing everywhere I go to chipotle places have the same,I live in kendall - miami and it was a log time I haven't gone to eat in chipotle because of their terrible,exact taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not much else to say because everyone knows the food is fabulous,This is an okay chipotle,I ordered a veggie bowl ,also had to remind them about the corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just because it ends up containing more food than the burrito wrap itself can hold,I usually go with the burrito bowl,Their cliantro-lime rice is also delicious,there have been a few times where the rice can be a little,The prices are very fair,My favorite toppings to add to the bowl are the fajitas (the peppers ,The chicken tastes really good,A little mild with some hot salsa is always a good,corn salsa,and of course the hot + mild salsa,sour cream,lettuce, and is always hot and tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For our our son's grad party - we decided to use Chipotle on Morse Road for some of the food,What we wanted was one type of burrito,but he (the manager) felt should have several - so ended up with 65 burritos,  We also took a couple of boxes of their chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I arrive to pick up and pay and when I asked about my food they start it to do it at that moment ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You create your own burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is food all over the ground,and the server had an open wound on her wrist while preparing my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle never dissapoints for having wholesome amazing food served fast,with food being fresh,a hint of brown rice (like a small,I like to have a bowl filled with lettuce leaves,double meat:  chicken ,pinto beans,and steak,corn, and grilled right in front of you while the staff quickly move the patrons through their choice of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Had a two-for-one burrito coupon, Manager wouldn't honor it stating repeatedly my son's bean and cheese burrito was not a burrito,  After I looked down to verify my skin really was Mexican brown I gave up on using my free burrito coupon,  Next trip manager was going to charge me a veggie burrito for $7+ for beans, This cost $4 for a bean & cheese burrito ,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great choice for Mexican food near the Florida Mall,I have come to enjoy burritos,especially Chipotle's burritos,and I settled on a chicken burrito with rice ,Even though beans ,and cheese (my usual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All kinds of salsa,meat bomb,cheese shredded with only the finest of tools,Crispy lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I appreciate the concept - organic meats,fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the burrito I had here was not as good,I discovered Chipotle now serves brown rice as an option,nor was the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle I've ever had,clumpy rice,cold and undercooked meat,sour cream etc for around ,They also charge you for a side of lettuce,For that much I can go to super target right across the street and buy a whole iceberg lettuce for that much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we will hit the new location out at Cascade Station by the PDX airpot instead (which we have already and they meet/exceed our chipotle expectations),usually out of some staple be it rice or one of the meats, rice has been spicy on several,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the second time I have ordered online came at the correct pick up time and my food is cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No need to repeat that they're food is DELISH,this insanely long line took us no more than 10 minutes to have our yummy burrito bowls in hand,yummy burrito bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is ok,Worst chipotle I have ever been too,On multiple occasion s they are out of ingredients without informing anybody,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The brown rice just added another element for me,Can be a bit pricey for what is relatively a quick,They always seem to have fresh ingredients,and the taste shows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle we have ever been to,Burrito bowl was HALF full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thought we would try Chipolte once again after all of the scare that's been going on with the food, I think the food scare is the least of the problems, Stale chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my typical barbacoa bowl (which is a little more money at this location than others thanks to the f'n plaza,For some reason Chipotle refuses to trim the fat off its meat, Fatty meat to me is like nails on a chalk board or soggy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Barely finished my salad today it was so bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
passing along my burrito ,do I want some chips or drink,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good quality and quantity food,U can mix rice ,Nice veggie bowls ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Service is fast and food is always great,By far the most consistent chipotle I've been too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had the burrito bowl this time,not as gut bustingly filling as the burrito seems to be,though I'm always surprised by price,those prices seem steep,2 bowls (with guac) chips,good quality fillings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
organic food at very reasonable, prices ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a chipotle so if you've been there before you know to expect some great healthy Mexican-style food for a reasonable,and the food is still good,I've been a fan of chipotle for a long,Don't bother going to any other chipotle location if you can help it,price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Asked for a chicken burrito bowl today ,and the employee gave me a scoop of rice ,and 4 pieces of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am willing to wait in line for good food,Love that chipotle cares about our health ,and does not use GMO meet and ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
throw your food together ,worst chipotle ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the gentlemen who wrapped my burrito,and the burrito before me was a massacre,but to re-create the Boston massacre into a burrito is just bad,they ran out of chips two hours prior to closing, taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 By the time they managed to (poorly) wrap our burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is my go to place to fill my Mexican food cravings,They are super fast and the food always tastes amazing,& seriously how cute are the kid size chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I feel the food is as good, as most locations but they seem more stingy with the meat here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This speaks volumes about the quality and taste of the food at Chipotle,I do avoid the rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle still serves as a good inexpensive food fix ,"which would definitely make a dine-in visit a little more interesting than your typical ""Mexican"" fast-food spot",which will be either a one-size-feeds-all burrito,burrito bowl (the innards of a burrito,set of tacos (crispy or soft,Though I maintain that they are a little overpriced for a meatless salad topped almost solely with salsas,cilantro-lime rice,Your selection can be made with chicken,black or pinto beans,tomatillo-green chile salsa,roasted chili-corn salsa,fresh tomato salsa,And don't forget the chips and salsa before you pay at the register,they offer the aforementioned meats,guacamole,steak,shredded cheese ,sour cream,My veggie salad consisted of sliced romaine lettuce,) or a salad,and a honey-kissed vinaigrette for the salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks for awesome service and great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
)  The food is almost always spot on ,and the portions and prices are great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We've had undercooked and overcooked food, Internet orders still have to wait in line to get their food made like a regular, Manage your inventory better (how the eff do you run out of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really mostly like chipotle in general,Please change it back chipotle,Over the course of the last year the mild salsa has consistently gotten worse , I used to look forward to coming to get that particular salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The corn salsa was soggy, yellow corn instead of the non-,GMO white corn usually served , and listed on the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gabriel and Yesinya made honestly the best burrito I've ever had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the freshness of the food ,and the consistent quality of my meal ,I also don't think you can Yelp as fast food place based on taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and doesn't taste like anything like other Mexican food joint I've been to,the food seems really fresh,I also don't care for the chicken that they use - it tastes kinda, I don't like the salsa,The only thing I get from this place is the hint of lime tortilla chips - NO SALSA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice,with pinto beans,cheese,sour cream,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only refunded back the one affected even though three were ordered and food comes from same,Hair in burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same ol good burrito bowl that I get ,like the other chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like that you can watch them put your burrito together,I shy from the 5 star rating because they tend to overstuff the burrito ,I like that they have many salsa choices (to know me is to know my love of a good,salsa bar),I like that they have veggies they can add -- so I have more choices than just bean & cheese (which I love btw),but that's just my fat butt fighting with my taste buds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The workers are pretty friendly and remember me cause I'm in there so much lol They are quick and get you out of there really fast if you're getting your food or drink to go,I get a chicken or vegetarian burrito bowl(or a sweet,The sweet tea is usually sweet(it's not always sweet at other chipotle's or it's been brewed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my husband's burrito fell apart ,and my tacos were super,We love our chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is always fresh, Their guacamole is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,The price is fair, the quality of the ingredients is genuinely good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Chipotle location and many others are now limiting the amount of food they place in your food,rice ,I'm paying $7 for a small bowl beans,Ex: half a spoon of tomato or lettuce,50 cent for extra shredded lettuce the size of your palm,I can walk to Target and buy a whole bag of lettuce for $1,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always bland-not-enough-lime guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rendering it a tasteless mishmash,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I initially wanted the steak bowl ,Finally I sat down and enjoyed my bowl the guacamole is always the best part,but I was disappointed in how dry the steak looked so I settled for chicken which wasn't a bad,The sour cream seemed a bit watery so I passed on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a steak bowl ,and received chicken,my container of salsa was half empty, and my chips were smashed to crumbs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted off,The taco shells tasted plastic like,The chicken was really off as well,The chips were soggy,And now I'm deliciously,Please please please do a quality check , and tasted either not fried,everything just didn't taste as good,I was also starving coming back from a mtn trip and would've eaten anything but this I couldn't even finish because the taste was so completely off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so in between most orders is a phantom burrito being made for no one around,That cilantro rice ,They have been out of an item at least half the time I've visited (be it brown rice,and their fresh salsa,or kids-sized chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How does that happen at a chipotle,I am a huge fan of chipotle , Customer service was lame and they were out of small containers for a side of salsa or guac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice,Every single time I have been there I have had to walk through chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
disorganized and wrap the burritos so loosely along with adding things in that were not asked for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location shows a lot of respect for food allergies,I've only ever had a less-than-stellar experience here twice out of the near 100 times I've gone to this chipotle in the past,Its ingredients are always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2/24/16- being that this is a brand new location I was expecting it to be clean and the food to be more amazing,As I ordered my food - I received subpar,When I got home I opened my food up ,e-coli break outs and poor food inspection scores) I remained a loyal,customer because the food is good,I will no longer support an establishment that has one trained their employees to be stingy with serving sizes and does not have required food items available,I did not eat my meal because who likes the taste of burnt chicken ,I ordered a salad which usually comes with salad,"dressing- The employee says "" We ain't got no more salad dressing-",I was shocked and left the restaurant without salad dressing for my salad,and no salad dressing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chicken was completely burnt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My bowl felt so inadequate,Out of corn and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The servings are all American so ask for a to-go box so you could split that burrito (lest you continue to exp,"since ""they"" make my sushi but not my burritos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Good solid food,I can only comment on the chicken burrito because that is all I eat, I love the burritos ,The only negative I have is the burrito tortilla is the type that really gets stuck in your teeth,The price is very fair for a burrito, Like I said the burrito alone is really a bunch of great,Overall an excellent well rounded burrito, The chicken has some spice to it that adds to the flavor,although I would not call it (the chicken) spicy or hot,50 more for guacamole which seems like a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burrito salad guy,Prices:  Reasonable,First guy on the line - the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just found a penny in my food maybe this is how chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food is so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes it's Mexican-American infused food,except that one time I had to wait for the chicken,it's fresh and taste great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
service grumpy -  indifferent and rushed and my food was served cold,I usually love chipotle ,and have been to many locations across the country over the years but this was my worst chipotle experience ever,after eating here probably because the chicken was not served at the proper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two stars for the food because,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
husband and I got food poisoned,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This store has always had irritable employees but the food is not that tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Get a chicken burrito bowl with a mix of brown & white,rice,Black beans,Corn salsa & Cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice game here is on point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how can you serve food in such a dirty setting,i watched them make my food everything looked okay,the worst chipotle i've ever been to in my life,chicken in the sofritas,cheese mixed in the guacamole,i got home and had cheese in my guacamole,so many people are lactose intolerant and have dairy allergies why in the world is there cheese ,and sour cream in your vegetables ,tomatoes & corn,corn & tomatoes so disgusting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
C'mon guys the Jamaican place next door has bowls ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When he slid my bowl to the next person part of my food fell out,Scooped up the food that fell out along with all the other,food stuck to the dirty counter,First half the meat trays were empty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
last week I had melted  polythene in my burrito ,and this week the rice was uncooked,I know it's fast food but much appreciated if some one does a quality check on them before it's served to customers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fresh healthy food,I'm looking forward to them bringing in brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but this chipotle could do a lot better,Today the whole bowl is extra,They are often out of essential items like chicken or black, salty and the chicken is extra,beans,This location is on a busy corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is disgustingly cold,So no its not the food that is the problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our food is always hot,JP is awesome and cooks chicken like a boss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you don't dissect the last quarter of the chipotle burrito that's been sitting in your fridge for the past,three days in order to peel off that slimy top layer of lettuce before you microwave it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I'm guessing because their food is AMAZING,Prices are affordable and you get a lot off food for the price,Life is burritoful ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and literally felt like I had run through an obstacle course in the hopes that a burrito-bowl-type-object might emerge with me on the other,"""Can I please have a burrito bo-""","""brown or white rice",Beans is beans,and I love beans,"""meat",::points to various brown meats::,"""sour-cream-cheese""",can I get lettuce too,light dusting of lettuce ensues::,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never had a problem and always get a huge burrito for less than $8,They even remade my burrito one time ,I only ever get a burrito with no sides so not sure,but the burritos are delicious,I read here that a lot of folks are complaining about the stale chips, how the chips are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but you do get a lot of food ,I really like their burrito bowls,brown rice,black beans,cheese,most cheese is awesome,sour cream,and maybe the sour cream on the side so you can still heat up the leftovers later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I value my stomach and health over their monopolized priced guac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I can't fully enjoy my food at this location because it's perpetually FREEZING inside,The food's made well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As long as you remember to not let them stuff your wrap full of filler rice ,The steak and chicken are uniformly grilled to tender,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos that my husb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Better than fast food quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is lackluster,I love burritos,tacos,and salsa,chips,guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They also offer multiple types of salsa - which allows those with softer palates,guacamole) they are told there is an extra,Great fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So my wife went pick up 2 salad bowls , Did not get the salad dressing nor salsa for the chips because they were in a rush to push people through,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Run out of cheese,I had to go without an ingredient I requested,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love Mexican food ,) but every time I order from here the food tastes radically different,other times I am loaded up with enough food to feed a small,but the food itself tastes different,Love the food (most visits) ,but consistency is key if you want to keep his burritologist coming back for more,stale chips (get your stuff together,Stale chips come on,good portions and good quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Get the Barbacoa burrito,Best guac of any chain burrito place i've been,Really good cilantro lime rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle ever,No salad dressing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is exactly as I've come to expect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is still good,.food is still good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The absolute worst chipotle in America,just realized they forgot my cheese as I am writing this - can't say I'm surprised,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The atmosphere was a bit chaotic and it took a while to get to the counter to order my food,My burrito bowl was OK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 If only for their food, My disdain has nothing to do with the food, You would think a food-service business would be more conscientious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had I received this notification early enough I could have picked up food somewhere else,inconsistent portions (be careful who is prepping your bowl that day ,"I am standing at the unmanned register while witnessing one of the employees shout out the following to the ~10 or so people standing in line: ""we are out of chicken",corn salsa,guacamole,and guacamole,80 on guacamole,lettuce,I never encountered the problem of this location running out of several key ingredients until about two months ago,How can a store that consistently has a 20+ minute line wait seemingly so often be unprepared to complete a shift fully stocked on ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the burritos aren't big,And at nearly $2 for a swig of guacamole on your burrito, enough to justify the price,Maybe I just have a problem paying that much extra for guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-The signature chipotle chicken is hot,-You can get as many salsas as you want,-One shouldn't need to ask for extra lettuce ,The first salad I ordered had enough lettuce to qualify as garnish,when ordering a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food ,i came there 13 times and have driven past it to another food place seeing the long,excellent quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is good quick burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good food,brown rice,Salad bowl (no dressing),double chicken,black beans,light sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Average food,the meat was warm,My salad was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and server try to hurried things and not listening carefully for bowl ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am not one for sauces so when it comes to Mexican food I stick with Tacos,For the same price I can walk away with twice the tacos from Taco Bell,While the were fresh and tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The girl who was heating the burritos screamed her 'welcome, My meat on my tacos was super,My chips tasted a bit stale,they were out of corn,It was so delicious I could have eaten two containers of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they run out of food often,but never goes above and beyond (even when they run out of salsa ,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It always has a line to the door and the the food is usually not as good,I have been to multiple chipotle locations , as other locations:/ very sad this particular chipotle sucks:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Asked for a steak burrito bowl ,I got chicken instead ,and was told they were out of steak,"just kind of mumbled ""we don't have steak right now""",they were also out of cheese,How does a Mexican place run out of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food score is currently an 88,brown rice,Throw it all in one bowl to chill ,I ordered a veggie salad topped with black beans,The dressing was a salsa vinegarette mix which was very decent,Bought a an extra bag of ships since its cheaper with money and time then going to the grocery store to take home and eat with my homemade salsa,"grilled veggies with by request a"" little of sour cream"" and cheese",Altogether it tasted pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In fact our bowls were only half,The quantity of chicken provided was laughably inadequate,even with all the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you go in the morning it is normal chipotle quality food,I have been to this chipotle multiple,The past four times I have gone to this chipotle at night it has been a mess,If you want chipotle from this location,The guacamole was turning ,quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pick up my food , The food is good, and the steak is better than it used to be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would advise that the brown rice ,and black beans is the best combo (IMHO),"It says ""cheese OR sour",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Any Chipotle customer knows what that burrito or bowl is supposed to look like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hard tacos with just rice, The rice is soooo,chicken , good and the chicken is spicy ,have a hint of lime to them and they also have many salsas to pick from,Their chips (which you have to pay extra,and cheese,and there's something about the cheese that is just so much better than the yellow,cheese or white/yellow mix you get at most tex-mex, It is just so darn delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This used to be a pretty okay spot to eat at but now it seems that the customer service is getting worse and worse first of all when I place my order online it does not tell me what it shows you my name that I paid with my credit card or the name that I enter for the order so you need to be more clear on that and secondly for a person that's been coming there for almost 3 or 4 years you should know who I am by now being that you've been working there just that long and handed me my food every time I come in there ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and Price always reasonable,I really do like soy meat option,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Listening to people argue about Chipotle being ""good Mexican food"" is like listening to midgets argue about who's tallest", Chipotle is not Mexican food, Good food, It is a McDonald's-owned attempt to assemble a set of ingredients, The ingredients are reasonably fresh, and tasty and the final product is affordable and tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As someone who works in food service this was appalling the overall,This is one of the worst chipotle's I've ever been too,Started to make my bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food and service is just like any other chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I feel like the food here just takes crappy, I prefer the Chipotle on Broadway for the food , You have to ask for more salsa because they don't even give you a full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The meat portions was very small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For the price,I have a family of 4 and we usually get bowls,For the second time in a row we get home and the bowls are pretty much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the employees are sincere and friendly and the food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their counters weren't wiped after food fell on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Restaurant has been open all of 20 minutes and a total of three customers none of which are sitting in the booth by the side with exit door yet  the seat is scattered with rice droppings as well as is the small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the worst chipotle I have ever been to,It was unorganized and the worst experience I've ever had in a chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff is not always the nicest but the food is good,well unless you want chips and salsa,The chips are almost always stale,If you want chips that are sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the food ,The burrito has a lot of flavor and is plenty of food,and I am not a big fan of rice ,but the brown rice is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""  I thought that the quesadilla (with very little cheese and a few pieces of chicken) didn't come with chips", How about the restaurant being out of chips, The worst part is that when I asked for chips w my son's quesadilla,"the response was ""No chips",I asked for chips at the register where we were informed that they were OUT of chips,A Mexican restaurant was out of chips,"""  They were out of corn and cheese ","let's discuss the ""salad", What's worse-there was no salad dressing , I just wanted salad dressing,The water was even bad and tasted like plastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 After going to two banks ($400 limit) I returned to cold food , The manager is so mean I refused to take any food,the food is probably not far behind in its taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its pricey ,Chipotle pre cooks their meats ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the burrito bowl is about half,If you're in Braintree and craving a burrito/burrito bowl,I had to ask for more rice ,and beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I want to like this place because when the quality is perfect the food is unbelievable,I walked out the other day when the portion was half the size of the bowl ,But when the chicken is consistently burnt,and they decided to charge me for double meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The foods good,I typically don't write reviews but it's been bothering me that someone on their management decided on their personal time to tell one of my coworkers he doesn't like how I order burritos ,Granted I have a very busy job where I can't order a burrito 30 minutes in advance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I agree with a previous reviewer this location has terrible service and management but good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the manager honestly informed me that  ""this kind of thing happens from time to time because we don't use pesticides in our food""",As soon as I took the lid off of my burrito bowl,we love(d) it that much) when I discovered that they acquired brown rice,perched atop my lettuce,and not 10 seconds later my boyfriend discovered a bug in his lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is always good,I went in today to buy a burrito for a homeless man who was outside on the street,They made the biggest burrito I've ever seen ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is always packed with people,and my boyfriends from natick so when we're in the mood for chipotle we'll go there,but honestly my chipotle back in seekonk is SOO much better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like the salads but overall  my favorite combination is the Steak Burrito bowl with rice only,corn salsa,guacamole,lettuce, It took me a while to find a combination of the ingredients that I loved, It's really delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The workers were mean to each other (one girl was training another condescendingly) and the burrito was half the size it usually is (very skimpy, servings of rice,beans,and meat),I also thought the barbacoa meat tasted strangely bland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Half the time they rip my burrito,it gets me a bowl, I want a bowl every time,Try the corn salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are consistent with food quality ,Ultimately in the food business,sometimes they don't know how to wrap burritos,you don't need to be so skimpy on the meat and overly generous with the rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I don't understand why the management team wouldn't try to implement more lean practices to be more efficient and understand their demand so they can order enough food for their location ,we are out of dressing or cheese and last time it was steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food has been consistently good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and wonderful food,I will definitely be going back to this chipotle location, I always get the fajita salad bowl,I asked for extra cilantro and the nice guy poured practically the whole container on my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Their food is always fresh,I like this location to grab my steak burritos, This is a nice Mexican chain esp the burritos, I like the organic steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First off everyone should know they don't cook their meat at the restaurant,It's received frozen and then warmed up so if you think you're getting fresh ingredients think again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wanted cheese ,and there was NONE in the container on the line so I asked did they have more cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best quickest fresh food in vancouver with employees who actually know what good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 You pick how you want your food (burrito,salad,) and we opted for salads,$18 for two salads ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They handle the rush way better than winter park which skimps their customers during the lunch hour by giving about half the food,Best chipotle around,My only complaint with chipotle is the overpriced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-Too cheap for so much food,rice,We shared our favorite bowl ,Suggestion: 1/2 portion bowls pleas,-Healthier and more responsible meats ,We no longer eat here because of the soybean oil in EVERYTHING and getting a bit tired of the taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The meats are cooked well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both were delicious with black beans,we had the veggie salad,and the veggie salad with tofu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super clean inside and out and by far the friendliest staff of any chipotle I've been to, So much so I'd drive past closer chipotles to get to this one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 45 mins for a burrito,Worst chipotle ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Decently priced food for the quality ,Chicken burrito is a safe,with lots of tomato salsa,but it's where I first got the steak salad,I recommend the steak salad,I think I smothered my salad with a fourth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
me and my friend ate here the other day and we both got food poisoning,she ordered a chicken burrito,i had a vegetable bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I ordered my food ,didn't give us salad dressing for our salads,They didn't give us all our ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything taste great healthy fastfood,the cost for them for a burrito has got to be less than a ,i have been going since they opened in this area but they've become very cheap with the meat why,00 Quit be in so cheap wit da meat,This place used to be owned by mcdonalds they have 5 things on the menu they use organic and locally produced ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food is alright,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just go up to the counter and grab my food,but my idea of mild is sour cream on white,The salad vinaegrette is a recipe I'd kill for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overall good and the food was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I paid and she gave me my food,food was sub,I got back and the guacamole wasn't on the salad,I wanted to make sure the dressing for my salad was in there,the portion of the salad was sooo small,Usually I would have a heaping salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My buddy bit into his burrito , I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always great,you can taste the freshness of the food,worrying too much about efficiently getting the food taken care of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They never trim the fat from the steak,And I avoid the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is good,I get 2 - 3 meals out of their burritos or bowls every time,Prices are good,their chips are AMAZING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's good if you're looking for a solid meal and it's definitely one of my comfort foods,I personally get the chicken burrito bowl because of it being the cheapest,I ask for rice ,Then I get beans and chicken,meat ,sour cream,and lettuce,I get corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the employees spend more time horsing around with each other over the exposed food than actually attending to their customers ,The worst part was the employees horsing around and laughing over exposed food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only one or two people on the main food line which is strange,Portions are pretty average but if I'm paying 2 bucks for guacamole on my food I expect a decent,"Now I've seen the supervisors lecture the workers about ""you need to put less"" and one happened to be on my food",I like chipotle a lot ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Slowest chipotle I've ever been too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you're spending a few hours in the Natick Collection you'd probably need a reasonably priced meal that's worth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food is so fresh,burrito or your salad,You can really customize your taco's,They offer healthier options for those looking to cut the calories with brown rice or wheat soft,I also like the fajita option to escape the beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went in today and instead of using the usual spoon to scoop out chicken he used one of the salsa cups ,and called it 4 ounces of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love getting their bowls,when I'm craving a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is hot,The food doesn't Wow me ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like chipotle,But this location is ALWAYS out of guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoy the food typically from chipotle ,but from this location it's always cold the chips are ALWAYS stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was OK,we were finished eating before they even got to order there food,it wasn't hot and the chicken was old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,Today I had soft tacos with chicken to go,When I got back to the office I enjoyed my tacos (3 came in the meal) ,but I did not enjoy that they were sitting in a pool of salsa juices,It's not that I don't enjoy the taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An employee was teaching another employee how to wrap a burrito while another just watched with her back leaned up against the wall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was delicious,I always order a burrito bowl,so I order plain rice,The guy who prepared my bowl was very courteous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By far the dirtiest Chipotle I have ever been in and first time I have ever had bad food from a Chipotle,thy were covered in food ,We both got a burrito bowl ,By boyfriends was just as bad he threw his away and we both had half cooked over salted tortilla chips,and I had the steak which is my all time favorite,The steak was so chewy,even though I just moved around the corner from it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love this chipotle,People shouldn't complain it's busy though it's at the mall and one of the main chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not uncommon for them to not have white rice,How hard is it to spot that chicken is low,or a particular meat ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With all of the issues with the quality of their food you would think these restaurants would make an effort to change,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When the woman changed the lettuce container she set the container in the lettuce bin to fill it ,and the bottom of it was covered in cloudy water an old bits of lettuce yuck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For me that's the one thing I look forward to when creating a bowl or burrito,This particular location was skimpy on the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food seasoning in this location is tasteless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the food value,2/5 stars based on value of food for the price ,The chicken and rice were bl,We had ordered 3 chicken bowls,I love the consistent taste all over the country,and taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
assumed the food would be okay,Food was cold and none of the staff gave a shite about quality or if the food looked appealing,People preparing food probably wanted to be anywhere ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,Who doesn't like their chips,I like the salad with sofrita,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is st,Three stars is the best I can give this spot and that's only for the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
limes are not existent in the rice or for extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got the brown rice burrito bowl with steak ,Fresh ingredients,Fresh and healthy ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The amount of chicken and toppings on my burrito bowl was laughable,I go to chipotle at least once a week ,This particular chipotle has really been slacking lately,They were also out of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 stars due to the food being alright,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Side Note for identification : There was a sheriff behind us and I paid for his burrito ,but he ended up getting a bowl instead,This place is such a rip-off considering the server puts only half a spatula of chicken in ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was like it always is at Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was as to be expected decent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which makes it a great place to stop and grab food,but I come to Chipotle for burritos not an experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then you might want to try a specialized drilling machine that can go underneath the ground and drill up in the parking lot so that you can get your food in a decent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 best deal in town for healthy food,Bam 1500 calories and 2 massive roll it yourself burritos,It's chipotle,double rice double,Get a bowl, beans double, salsas ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the fresh or what appears to be fresh food,Overall this place is good quick eats for a TON of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is a great restaurant concept in that it is fast food service without the junk food regret, I came back to find my table clean and my half eaten burrito disposed of, Because it is basically multiple variations on rice ,and beans - the prices are decent, The ingredients here are top, quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my food ,I was basically eating sour cream and rice and it was disgusting who eats food like that,Today I came to enjoy my favorite bowls at chipotle because I wasn't having a good,I choose to eat at chipotle at least twice a week due,She explained that she would have to get her manager and she did and I explained how dissatisfied I was with my meal because I was basically eating sour cream and rice ,they placed too much salt in the rice or the time my guacamole was brown because they placed it in the heater waiting for me to pick it up,I throw the bowl straight in the trash in front of him,I tried mixing my guacamole and meat with it ,and get what I usually order but as I sat down to eat I didn't enjoy it because the child that made my order put too much sour cream,but it didn't satisfy my taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,Like it- it's the subway of burritos,Excelent salads and burritos, and fast a generally delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is that great quick Mexican food fix ,The food was ,"Had a chicken bowl only thing missing was the ""patron""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle has some of the worst customer service,I asked for extra lettuce and the employee just threw it onto my bowl as if I asked for 1st ,they were out of chicken,How do you run out of chicken at Chipotle,So myself and 4 other people decided to wait on chicken,The poor guy in the back was chopping up the chicken so fast,the chicken had just come off the grill,One of the people in front of me noticed the chicken was pink,she cancelled her order because the employees then had to throw all of the chicken away ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheaper food ,and solid burritos -- it's all good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they were out of three main ingredients (rice,beans,and a few types of the meats),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always have great fresh food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I'm a booty builder who eats everything piled on that bowl,Fresh chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stopped in for a burrito bowl to go for lunch,what beans,which salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Made the decision that it might be healthier than the eating Sysco food every day (work cafeteria),Had no idea this one was right around the corner from where I work,Love the Chipotle quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I choose to go to Chipotle because of their veggie friendly options and I shouldn't have to wonder whether or not my food will have steak in it,As I was enjoying my poorly prepared salad bowl at home,I chomped down on a pretty big piece of steak in my VEGETARIAN bowl,finding a piece of steak in your vegetarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tasty and healthy veggie food does not get any better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They hardly give you any meat ,Quality of ingredients is not consistent - tomato's used in pico look pink instead of red and lettuce is not always fresh,Save your money if your looking for quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,but I'm extremely frustrated as they won't allow online payments via the iPhone app (they used to) but they DO via the chipotle website,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The mild salsa and corn salsa are my favorite paired with the fajita veggies and brown rice,Always go for the bowl or a couple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't go as often as I used to (maybe a couple times a year now) but I love their veggies with the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They felt the food was pretty good,We decided on chipotle because they had never been,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,but you're waiting 30 minutes to get a salad bowl,The chicken is usually burnt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and always make me my food exactly how I ask them to,their veggie burritos are huge, & delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I will always pay cents more for food I know that is not coming from a factory farm where they inject animals with antibiotics ,People should take into consideration that Chipotle serves naturally raised poultry and meats ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my burrito touches the counter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chewy steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We all know the food at Chipotle is good, It's a good product that could really only be improved if they would roll longer thinner burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your average Chipotle food,Always fresh and good taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I all food poisoning,This place should not be allowed to serve food to people,When we called chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was good food ,but they ran out of brown rice,I had the steak bowl couldn't eat it al,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By far the most mediocre chipotle ever,It's like this chipotle is trying to portion out their scoops of chicken as if they are afraid,to run out of their own version of chipotle chicken,Maybe I'm spoiled by the one right by my work on Bethel road where they never run out of chicken,and don't skimp on the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do not get the chorizo burrito,It tastes like old dried out meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is usually fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most won't give salsa unless charging,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am giving Chipotle five stars because not only is this burrito joint,Avoid those sketch places that offer 89 cents tacos and burritos with mystery meat ,You can get a burrito bowl with all the fixin's for 6 bucks,but they also make sure that they are serving you quality ingredients,delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I always get the chicken burrito bowl ,and sometimes I add guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the food is delicious,Chipotle is by and far the BEST burrito chain,I always get a chicken burrito bowl with white,you'll get a clean table devoid of grains of rice , rice,and beans all over it,pinto beans,that salsa stuff,guacamole,and sour cream with a tortilla on the side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good burrittos but overpriced beleive,it or not i can get 5 double beef  cheesy at taco bell for less then there one and they are delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm giving this chipotle 5 stars because compared to other,chipotles I've been to this is the best one, Ive been to probably 10 different chipotles ,it could be a revamp of all chipotles ,Yay chipotle, Burrito bowl anyone, The chicken was not dry,cheese ,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that food is pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I already love it and love going in to get their burritos ,and being that chipotles are pretty much,I don't know if I could visit this location again or if chipotle has just gone downhill,and when I got chips they were so hard,and guacamole (one of the best guacamoles out there) , and stale tasting it was absolutely disgusting to keep eating them with guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and yes the guacamolee is extra, At least we are not all paying for a few's guacamole,but everything I have tried is delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the same girl who was being sloppy with my food (,"Her next smart response (WITH EXTREME ATTITUDE) was ""Oh so you want less food",The only reason we stayed was because he really wanted the food that we came in there for,I ordered a burrito bowl,This was no longer a burrito of any kind,It wasn't even a burrito anymore,the chipotle employee will a) ask if you would like it remade,(Let me just say that my boyfriend orders this every time we go to chipotle,I love chipotle as much as the next,The gentleman preparing the tortillas and serving the rice,they could probably go a little lighter on the rice ,She was sloppily throwing ingredients into my bowl (guac in the corner,"The associate then goes ""well do you want me to put it in a bowl",") then says ""do you want me to put this in a bowl"" smh",beans,and beans because there was a lot,soupy tomato salsa that she couldn't care to drain) she was trying to rush so fast (no line ,and meat was very polite,sour cream in the other, corner,The girl that was then serving the remaining ingredients was extremely rude,and his because she had to scoop off ingredients since she decided she wasn't going to listen to his order either) began to wrap his quesarito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle food is Chipotle food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,pick it up chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Honestly one of the worst chipotles if not THE WORST I have ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same burrito bowl,and most importantly they know how to make a proper bowl/burrito,I hate the chipotle in the mall,and he thought it tasted different from past chipotle meals he has eaten,fill bowl with rice,no ingredients in the bowl except rice , The bowl is very dry,and beans , Sometimes they will add a string or two more of barbaccoa meat if you ask nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they only wanted to put half a spoon of chicken on my bowl(8 cubes)- had to ask for more,The person beside me ordering similarly had a ton of meat on theirs,Sometimes they are stingy with portions of meats,The guacamole is like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My review has more to do with a snarky comment made by the staff than on the food,I deserve to have fresh instead of old food, Chipotle changed the way they manage to-go sides of guacamole,the guacamole was oxidised already,and I asked (very nicely) to have the fresh guacamole put in a to-go,"and the other guy made a snarky comment about how ""someone should tell her what happens when guacamole hits the air",I make guacamole ALL THE TIME ,this last interaction has left a bad taste in my mouth (figuratively) after having done so (literaly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's over and I think I ended up getting 3 free burritos out of it (after buying 50+ during the same,Other days I'm a steak guy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We had the barbacoa salad and burrito bowls,These chain Tex-mex places are all about service and the quality of the meat,The barbacoa meat was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its not great mexican food ,Watch the burritos,Soft tacos are good,rice bowls are good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ive been to many chipotle locations , They allow the meat to run out causing the customer line to stall ,and the steak didnt, taste like anything,overall a very bland taste here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mediocre food served by screaming counter,The menu is limited and my biggest problem continues to be warm food smothered in ice cold,the server flung the guacamole across the tacos like she was throwing paint, salsa,guacamole ,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I got my food,but didn't remake the bowl itself so the rest of the food was cold,and my friend had to pick the cold food off of his uncooked,This is the worst chipotle I've ever been to,and I ordered chipotle,the rice was completely uncooked,and the rice was still undercooked,For some reason they put the rice in a separate,I had another meal with mine and they included a new bowl of rice,  rice ,and put it on the semi cooked rice,It was crunchy and even had water in the bottom of the bowl, bowl Thai time,and all the toppings in their own bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The burritos are always fresh,This chipotle is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SO SO SO SO AWESOME (as always) on the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can't tell you how many times we have gotten home with our food ,or another food item for our bowl,His burrito was as ordered,We have gone to this chipotle for years,I love chipotle,and the guacamole that we paid for wasn't in our bag,or our salad dressing,but my salad lacked dressing ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,"Then I told him again that I wanted a ""veggie burrito"" and since one guy cutting food on the back listened the whole",If you work on the hospitality and food industry you can't make fun of customers ,I requested a veggie burrito to the first,he started to make fun of me and repeating that I wanted a veggie burrito in a sarcastic,The next guy that took my burrito was laughing so bad,Today I had the chipotle crew laugh , person that took my order and right after he asked me what kind of meat I wanted,I said no meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can completely bypass the line and enjoy the tasty burrito bowl nirvana that is Chipotle ,or whatever flavor nirvana you scarf down at chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While I enjoy the food,the consistency of portion size and other miscellaneous restaurant services (I've in the machine and cold drinks) I just got a burrito ,I've had burritos with normal,I've been here so many times before and continue to write reviews to the chipotle office to tell them about this location ,and asked for double steak,It pissed me off and honestly I almost told them to put more on there because it wasn't double steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the food is good,Huge burritos that fill me up forever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I want rice & chicken in my bowl-,Service is super slow and if it's a bowl your wanting,I constantly have to ask for a little more this or little more that in my bowl because they've suddenly become very tight,with the amount they'll put in your bowl, not 2 huge scoops of beans with some cheese on top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know I will because it's the only quick decent food place within a mile of my house,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my food was cold,This isn't quality service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The bowl I had was huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my food is sitting in the car getting cold,Plops it right on my bowl,I told the line girl I wanted sour cream on the side two times ,they forgot my salad dressing ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Prices are not bad for all the food you get,I always order the burrito bowl-,OMG chipotle,1/2 white rice,chicken,1/2 black beans,hot salsa,and chips plus more HOT salsa,a lil cheese,a lil sour cream,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,Hope next time I am in the area and want some Mexican food they can do a better job,I noticed that my burrito looked smaller than the ones I've ordered in past,I saw that my burrito out of the four of us was smaller than the rest,but later another one of my friends found a hair in his burrito,Their was a wait for the black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Side of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and my food has always been fresh,Stopped in for a burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never have all their food items,Ignores me trying to pick up food at the register ,Sometimes the people working the line aren't listening & put food on that I didn't ask for,I'd rather drive an extra 20 minutes to go to a different chipotle,9/10 times its too much lettuce & they've had the vinaigrette once out of all the times I've been there,Don't recommend buying a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a steak burrito bowl ,A few chips with a bowl isn't a huge,and I don't think I can chew enough to bite through this steak,Terrible quality ,If you are going to charge top dollar please have top quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,2 employees couldn't wrap my husbands burrito up correctly so someone else had to come over to do it,because every was a disarray of condiments and beans,They forgot our son's quesadilla and also forgot to give us salsa that we bought,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some of the line guys preparing the food clearly are annoyed with special,The burritos are excellent,"and ""hit the spot"" when in need of a burrito fix",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have celiac disease and generally chipotle,After way over cooking my corn tortillas (that I asked not to be heated),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chicken in the burrito tasted strange,Skip the chips they are very stale,We purchased the large chips ,and queso lumpy with weird taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the natural food makes things twice as good,I've worked in the food industry part-time or full-time,I got my usual burrito bowl,and my friend enjoyed their burrito bowl as well,the rice,and the corn salsa (which is delicious,but the staff did get snippy with them over requests for a side of salsa,or a double order of chips and salsa,The meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you do pay more for guac but if you get the veggie burrito it is included,:) I always get a couple of extra burritos for the freezer ,Every now and again something is a little off in the burrito - the rice is a little,I always get the veggie burrito with extra,Make sure that you drop your business card in the pot so you can win 10 free burritos,"We have won twice now and for days I walk around singing ""I won ten burritossss", rice ,and corn salsa on the side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food is standard but an hour wait to get a burrito is uncalled for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not fresh ingredients brown soggy lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I found a COCKROACH in the salad bin, I reported it to the management and they just took the salad bin away , Hope their quality control is not lacking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I usually get the veggie tofu bowl with 3 salsa beans and rice, Reasonable price , Although most people do eat the entire bowl,Go down the list and pick out the salsa,meat to make your selection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was pleasantly surprised to find a Chipotle in the food court,how can the food go wrong,the chicken was not seared on the outside like it normally is,I could tell by sight that they had world's lousiest tomatoes in the mild salsa,but not the delicious healthy,and pretty much tasteless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I cannot enjoy my food eating in one of these places,Campylobacter and norovirus are the most common pathogens for food-borne,I love these burritos,and I like that they let me have them on my burrito for free,I love the bowls,as opposed to the myriad other ingredients that went into their bowl,regardless of whether I'm eating meat that day,how on earth would anyone know it was specifically Chipotle guacamole that was the cause of their intestinal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They are careless in preparation of the food ,Tonight I ordered a carnitas bowl for dinner, They had dropped quite a few peppers and onions from the adjoining dish into the carnitas bowl so I also had to pick these out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I dreaded the thought of the food court ,I was hesitant but anything is better than the food court,I went for the chicken salad minus the rice ,The chicken was super,and beans they offer,and the cheesecake factory,I loaded it up with grilled veggies and sour cream and cheese,TIP: if you don't like spicy then skip the salad dressing cause it's FIRE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is Chipotle so the food is still pretty,My friends burritos are always an absolute,I ordered the tacos once,and they only gave me 2 tacos ,and charged the same price they should for 3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My only complaint I that there is not a chipotle in Easton/Stoughton area, Unparalleled taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or the lettuce is super,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got a full avocado in my burrito today,Usually only leave positive reviews but this was honestly the worst burrito I've ever had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inconsistency in food portions ,Update: There hasnt been any guacamole shortages or any other,Many times they have been out of guacamole,Can't someone go to the store and buy avocados with the money we pay extra for guacamole with,some days it tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have amazing food,but totally worth it for the amount of food that you get ( which is a lot) ,The staff are a little mean and sometimes rush to fast and don't put enough of what you want on your food,I'm in love with chipotle,The prices are a little,95 which I feel is a bit over priced,I usually get the salad and if you don't get meat you get free,I love how the combination of the different salas and meat taste it's a wonderful,and it taste amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The workers are rude the food is never good,Like have a spoon of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is old,They make the best burritos,The only down side is after chips ,The guacamole is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love their food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I used to buy food here since it was so convenient,Today I ordered burritos for pick up,They instead made the burrito with Lettuce ,I'm leaving my burrito craving for Anna's Taqueria,I was charged for Guacamole in both of them and there was no guacamole at all, and loved the steak at Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the chicken is wonderful and you can choose what you want in your taco/burrito/bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and there was food all over the floor,It was so gross we took our food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not the chipotle I am used t,at the first station the girl asked which beans I wanted I asked for half black and half pinto and got one huge scoop of pinto beans then at the next station I asked for 2  scoops of mild salsa got about a half scoop and asked for light sour cream and got my bowl drenched in sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Save your time and stress and drive to one of the other delicious locations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place has really gone down hill with the quality of food,and the honey vinaigrette sauce is so inconsistent just like the food is now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overall best chipotle I have ever had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Standard Chipotle quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What's the point of having mobile ordering if you have to wait 3 hrs for your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and Chilito's except more expensive and has worse food,Horrible attitudes and acted like we were interrupting their down-time when we were ordering food,The beef was weird-tasting and the chips were stale,The cheese dip was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am not thrilled about the ongoing accumulation of blue sanitizer and food product wedged between the safety glass base ,beverage cups and food,I appreciated the young gal last night allowing us to sample the rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I was craving their delicious steak burrito, The woman who initially prepped my burrito put maybe 3/4 the amount of steak they usually do,I was really pleased when the next person who was finishing the prep of my burrito noticed ,which was a relief because I must have this smoky sauce with every bite of my burrito, My steak burrito was as good,"their amazing ""fast food"" steak burrito",12 including tax) the same way I always do - with plain white rice (NO CILANTRO),pinto beans,red-chili salsa,and asked me if I had asked for less meat,he quickly added more steak,cheese,sour cream,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ingredients used for the food are always fresh,even though I love the food here,Chipotle steak bowl with guacamole ,Unless the recipe can be altered to improve the taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fantastic chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But I had plenty of time to do so while I was waiting on the 15 minute wait to get a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But I have had to wait just so many times for my food to even be made it's beyond frustrating,I don't understand why I honestly keep visiting this particular chipotle,I tend to use the chipotle app to order because I like to take it Togo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You'll wait in line for 15 minutes for a cold burrito,05 for guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also never have enough people working the line so it takes forever to get your food,Worst chipotle ever,All they do is put rice on your bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is amazing everywhere I go to chipotle places have the same,I live in kendall - miami and it was a log time I haven't gone to eat in chipotle because of their terrible,exact taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When you order your burrito or burrito bol at any Chipotle locations,the guacamole and chips are the BOMB,A crap load of meat,Generous servings of meat is hooked up on the regular,And pretty much any other ingredients you want more of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(So you can figure out who this was) but these two people were flinging the food on the tables left from guests all over the chair,even comparing to the queso option at Moes or Willys (I love chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I ordered the infamous ""bowl""",this bowl was a pretty,I finished that bowl in every bit of 5-8,I got chicken,white beans,corn and mild salsa,guacamole,cheese,lettuce,but why so much lettuce,I will stand by the window & let them know how much lettuce I like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I watch them preparing burritos that easily could easily feed a starving family of four,I had the burrito bowl which is anything you want except for tortilla shell ,I had mine with the medium salsa and corn salsa top with cream and cheese and lettuce and cilantro lime rice,They have chicken,pinto beans it was absolutely the perfect,I was not brave enough to try the sofrita but it looked better than any meat they actually had on the menu,hot and corn,and it was absolutely delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I'm not a fan of that huge burrito,I always get tacos at chipotle, I like the simple tacos ,  My only complaint is when the cooks put the meat on your tacos,they don't drain it well enough so it's watery and then your tacos get all soft,This chipotle is always busy,I recommend you try chipotle if you haven't yet,too much bread and too much rice to me,and you can taste the meat which is so delicious, The meat is all natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Like any other chipotle they are quick,They fill the bowl up ,and have fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito was free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is really good food at any time,I love chicken bowl with mixed brown and white rice,black beans ,I have this delicious meal with chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they make your food correctly ,but with what they have the food is always delicious,I am IN LOVE with their salads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Staff is always super friendly and they actually give you chicken in your burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Other than that the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but no labels in front of the foods they offer you, All available as a burrito,nor the few times I've gotten a broken burrito,tacos, It's overpriced,one chicken, I always find myself looking at the four salsas, Chips and salsa are a meal in themselves,but all the meats are marinated ,75 more just for guacamole, I've had the guacamole here,or salad,Decent quality ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is consistently good," I have particularly appreciated the service here - I wouldn't expect ""good service"" at a fast-food-like", I always go with steak ,load up on the corn, It's a plus that it's conveniently in a mall in case you want to get some shopping done and across from Au Bon Pain if you had room for a delicious treat for dessert,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Messy food prep,I used to really like Chipotle but if this store is any indication the chain may no longer be holding itself to appropriate standards of quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is awesome,  It's literally faster to go shopping at winco and buy all the supplies to make your own burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 several people handling food without gloves,and not to mention there was food scattered all over the place,I love chipotle ,I enjoy chipotle just as much,A woman kept touching her pants and then chopping chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LOVE this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is consistently decent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,With the rewards program you can get a lot of food free,low priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had to get a knife to cut it but there was only one in the dispenser and that was used as a garbage and actually had food crusted on the bottom,It's only getting 2 stars because they didn't completely ruin the food,Both of our burritos were incredibly over stuffed (,"and the bean ""juice"" was included in the burrito) so they fell apart ",It wasn't worth asking to have it re-wrapped so I just had them put it in a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they didn't have any chicken or rice ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of my favorite places to go since the first time always enjoy my time here if your looking for burrito bowls t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is delicious simplicity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just got behind the woman that decided she wanted all of her toppings individually placed in cups so nothing touched her food,My first major issue was I ordered a salad bowl with chicken ,He proceeded to place barbacoa on top and my bowl moved to the next,there was a girl that kept reaching over my bowl to take or add things to the line,she literally put her armpit over my bowl at least 3 times,She reached 4 times total over my bowl,When my bowl was passed to the cashier,When the guy went to put the chicken in there was barely half a spoon of chicken left in the container,But I do know what an empty container when you've run out of chicken looks like,Why are you running completely out of meat ,I was charged for double meat,For not even half a spoonful of meat,It's Chipotle and it tastes delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 that one burrito feeds me for two days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was so salty,I understand that the food quality ,and there are not really chefs preparing the food,so why not prepare the food with reasonable,This is the 3rd time we have ordered food from here,Sister ordered a burrito bowl,my husband and I ordered burritos,one chicken,Just meat,and ingredients are dictated by the corporation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They put a generous amount of meat in my burrito--a little,It was more like a meat-ito than a burrito,They put cilantro in their rice,I hate rice with cilantro,I ordered medium salsa,It was more like hot salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most Chipotle's are pretty consistent when it comes to the food,Chipotle really figured out how to do fast Mexican food right,Like most Chipotle's they will over sour cream your burrito bowl if you aren't watching,salsa ,The chips,and guacamole are awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got to enjoy a great burrito bowl (barbacoa) outside as the sun went down over suburban,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get the chicken burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
staff can't roll a burrito,and my burrito was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Downtown it can be hard to find good healthy food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I onlinr ordered my food at 130pm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will say that the food is pretty,I tend to go for the chicken or the vegetarian burrito,Hard for me to give a chain above 3 stars (as there are way better burritos out there) ,Both are filling and packed with ingredients and you get the best flavor by combining a few of the different salsa options they have available, (I recommend the corn with spicy),The service is always really quick (even with a line) and the quality seems pretty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I come in to order - They ran out of chicken,After 20 minutes I finally get to order and find out they are all out of pinto beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Its priced the same and the food is similar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have proven that the concept of placing things in a bowl with an online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so good luck when a customer decides to order two or three burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Definitely my main chipotle I frequent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While I enjoy the food,the consistency of portion size and other miscellaneous restaurant services (Ice in the machine and cold drinks) I just got a burrito ,I've had burritos with normal,I've been here so many times before and continue to write reviews to the chipotle office to tell them about this location ,and asked for double steak,It pissed me off and honestly I almost told them to put more on there because it wasn't double steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food, Usually get the chicken ,half the time the chips are oil drenched to the point that they are crunchy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they offered myself and another customer a free large bag of chips and a 2 litter soda for making us wait so long for our food ~ due,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's always a long line for lunch (I mean it is the lunch rush) but it's never a super duper long wait and I still have time to order my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And it goes without saying that the food was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will also be writing Chipotle because there's no point in catering to vegetarians/vegans if the food is not kept,My husband and I are vegan/vegetarian and multiple times we have purchased a burrito only to find chunks of chicken in it,There's nothing worse than waiting in a LONG line only to find out we can't eat the burrito,rice) while we are ordering,We also have seen pieces of chicken in the various,the employees will just pick out the pieces of meat -- ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is an average Chipotle with great food in an ok,price ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got my food in less than a minute,Awesome food,I usually go for the bowls with either chicken or steak,I'm hesitant on trying to sofritas due to the macronutrient content having more fat and less protein in comparison to chicken or steak,The Barbacoa is delicious as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chicken bowl is a food group more than just an offering at a restaurant,Its very disappointing when you know the food is not going to be as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But I watched the gentleman behind the counter check out 12 people (handling money and credit/debit cards) and return right back to the food without ever changing his gloves,I politely whispered to him (before handling my food) that while I appreciated his hustle,pushed my food across the counter at me,turned and went right back to the food with the same,While I absolutely love chipotle,Once at the register with my bowl he mumbled under his breath,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The persons fixing the steak bowls have had an attitude everytime I ask ,It seems this will be my last Chipotle visit as the steak has been super,when will the next round of steak will be ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle had ever been to contacted the general,Please never go there worst place ever worse chipotle on eart,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have attempted to grab food ,it's absolutely delicious on every level,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last time it was cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always come to this specific chipotle because they are generous,First off the rice was grossly undercooked,  and they gave me like 5 pieces of steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the burrito bowls,everything is always so fresh and the HOT salsa is fantastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-cheese, The only thing they all could agree on was that no one could find the cheese,we're not shredding more cheese,-salad dressing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delicious and reasonably priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The medium salsa was a weird,The meat wasn't tasty,The taste was off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was at the head of the line for 20 minutes while one worker continued to remake the same burrito for another customer that he kept messing up,I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is chipotle ,but it seems like in this restaurant the portions are smaller compared to other chipotle restaurants,Also if you order guacamole on the side you get more than if you order it on the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lovely fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their food is delicious,Their burritos are beyond irresistible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tasty food - yup,That last bit could explain why I always order online and get my food to go,I've long since given up trying to eat one of their giant burritos without it splitting ,I always have plenty of tasty leftovers from lunch to take home and make into a normal sized burrito for dinner,and spilling all over and now only go for the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food area needed to be wiped down,The cashier was friendly but the ladies working the food line weren't,The food was off as well, The chips were stale, and the guacamole was poorly done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I LOVE Chipotle so what would keep me from eating their delicious food that makes my mouth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have the freshest food,The best burritos,The best burrito bowls,I love the that you have the choice of white rice or brown,rice,red beans or black,beans,And great chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After getting my food all the tables were full,When I started eating i noticed they barely put any meat so I mostly got a white rice and black bean burrito,I been wanting chipotle for a long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I only ever order the burrito bowl,The burrito bowl is enough, You get a choice of rice,beans,meat and salsa , They have the best guacamole,cheese ,and can add sour cream,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had to ask for cheese multiple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fresh tasty burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The guy behind me had to ask for extra everything because they were giving him taco sized,if you choose chipotle, The meat & rice are dry, portions for his bowl, like they aren't making fresh and replacing it on a regular basis and the chips last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have had food here soo many,The food is awesome,i have other chipotles around,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the staff is great always give me extra rice ,Barbacoa bowl with guacamole is very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even with Chipotle reeling from the recent foodborne,They were literally scraping the bottom of the rice bucket to fill my burrito,My burrito was OK,One thing I wish they would add (like Moes) is a self serve salsa bar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my burrito was poorly wrapped ,and all the gauc was at the bottom of the burrito spilling out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When it comes to chipotle,this chipotle would be the friend who laughs at the size jokes made by the bigger Chipotle's,I asked for double barbacoa and got maybe half a serving as compared to the other chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fresh,The rice had chopped cilantro in it which added a nice, taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is very clean inside and as always product an awesome burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Thank you for the great food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location will be my go to for my burrito fix these days,Llyod center has really left me with a bad taste in my mouth as almost every time I have went there they have been missing things ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always a long line but they make the most filling bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food comes up super,I've only been a few times and keep trying the chicken in my burritos hoping that it wont be so salty,I might as well dump half of a salt shaker into my burrito,or just skip the meat all together ,I will keep going back though just so I can try the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They serve good portions and if there is any problem with your food they are quick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got the head of an onion in my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even burrito composition ,1) Proper ingredient balance,and ingredient distri,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
05 a spoon which is stupid but to top it of that everyone that works night seem like they don't know anything about making a burrito or just lazy,They also don't know how to wrap the burrito,in one my brother unwrap the foil the burrito feel apart,They skimp on everything and will stare at you if you ask for a second scoop of rice or beans,they also didn't give a spoon full of meat,They raise the guacamole to $2,to cook the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had to wait for rice which was ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food taste great,taco, Carnitas bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why at 2 pm in the afternoon you've already run out of vinaigrette dressing or chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the food , For a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I paid $8 for a veg burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted a lot fresher than any other,This was the best experience to chipotle that I've ever encountered,I had planned to order steak,Once the steak was done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The 2 girls working were in such a hurry last time that they didn't put lettuce in my burrito bowel :,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Since they don't know how to wrap a burrito,I would suggest one stick with a bowl unless of course you bring a change of clothes since the burrito never holds together, The meat is decent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lettuce or some of the meat options,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On to the food,bowl: rice,chicken or steak,corn salsa,hot salsa,cheese,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Huge burrito that is enough,I always get the chicken burrito next, time I should try the salad or bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
take your burrito up to the food court for a different,Not the best burrito you'll ever have ,Pick your meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AWESOME food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"please"" I say as the young lady proceeds to heap a sopping load of burnt veggies onto my burrito","Like an illiterate mind reader she used her powers to interpret just the way I wanted her to use the sour cream: ""Make sure you drop that sour cream down at the end of the burrito so I get it all in one bite",Wrap that baby up and don't forget to slide it down the counter through the expired guac residue and salsa juice on it's way to the register, One star for not f'ing up the chips,the chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a bowl with guac,Sour cream in the bowl ,mild salsa,and sour cream on the side,lettuce,and no lettuce,corn,guava corn or tomatoes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's good stuff but I must say I do also like Baja Fresh and I do spread around my spending on QS Mexican food,perhaps I have coined a new term for a burrito maker) are,the portions and flavors aligned in a nearly zen like fashion and my burrito was just damn good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is chipotle people,but thy are the archetype many new restaurants are following because of chipotle's success,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst of all me and my wife only visit Chipotle for their chips,this location serves tortilla chips likely,Also taste was nowhere near the same,they lacked any freshness and that iconic salt and lime taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food has tasted fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which was like the best part of my burrito bowl since I didn't get rice,The chicken was charred ,The black beans were super,They also skimped on the guacamole,cheese or sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My friend went to pick up food we ordered through the app,Afterwards we told him he should go and talk to the manager because the associate should have packed the dip separately from the other food,Upon arriving back at work he noticed that the cheese had spilled in the bag ,He spent most of his lunch trying to clean the cheese out of his seat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They do not know how to properly prepare the food,I called the restaurant back to let them know about their unacceptable service and the person on the phone had to have been the same idiot that threw the food in the bag,My burrito was not wrapped at all making it impossible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is one of my go-to restaurants for lunch/dinner because their food tastes great,the end result of the food ,this means that your food is always completely fresh,I always get a version of a steak burrito bowl ,"and when i'm being ""bad"" I'll get their delicious chips (beware", because they have to replenish their ingredients much more quickly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The portions are small and the food is not properly prepared consistently,The sour cream is ice, cold and tastes like refrigerator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is not the popular chain it once was there's barely any customers so I'm confused as to why the employees continue to give there customers little scoops of food for my burrito,I go to chipotle often but this particular one in Braintree was so skimp in regards to my meal it was like rations used in the old days I'm disgusted especially since there was so much food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff is usually friendly and the food is always consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got a bowl to go today,I was in there yesterday and got a bag of chips: barely any salt ,The meat lacks flavor,Back at my office I notice that the guacamole is just rough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everyone knows about the food,so any reviews should be based pretty much solely on the service (including how the workers prepare the food),because when I got to the salsa spot in line someone had to run to the back to get more,I was even more confused when I got to the end and they had to go to the back again for chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food was really good but boy do they skimp on the chips at this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today I got a burrito bowl to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the ""schmutz"" in the corners grosses me out",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"
burrito bol didn't fill me up",at other chipotles,it was good but i'll frequent another chipotle,fresh meat +,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sprite tasted like water,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like Chipotle and consider it to be perhaps the best fast-food type restaurant around,the food has always been very good,We have had to wait for rice,brown rice was unavailable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So much food I can have it the next,I always stick with a burrito bowl,The chips are great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love their crunchy tacos as they are so very light,"The problem is they will get soggy in an instant SO I get them on the side and effectively get a ""bowl"" filled with my white rice",corn salsa,lettuce and cheese plus guac and chips,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You get a stingy spoon of meat on your burrito( i'v actually seen them take back a few,then they sprinkle the cheese on like it's gold and last but not least they wet the spoon with sour cream hold it above and let it drip off the spoon on to your burrito (insulting),cubes of meat if they thought you got too much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is pretty good,Your burrito is on us today, I usually get the veggie burrito with chips , The burritos are tasty, The rolling up of the burrito sometimes leaves a little, I'm sure they'll get better at rolling the burritos ,and salsa, I wish the salsa container was a bit bigger as I usually get through it within the first,and I'll ask for 2 containers of salsa next, The chips are nice, 10 chips ,the chips are good, and made with fresh tasting ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My fiancé went over to that location to pick up food to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
healthy food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no complaints about the quality of food here,good food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food is ridiculous,Their Barbacoa burrito is to die for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food Is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quality food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will take you 15 minutes at least of standing in line to get your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight the only complaint is they undercooked the white rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When you come to a nationwide-chain-type-place that serves chips and burritos,I'm here to tell you they were out of chips and salsa,I had just gotten off a plane and had been thinking about these chips for a few,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We first tried Chipotle (Portland) when they first came out in the very beginning and we really liked the food, The food h, All they do is go over and put on plastic gloves and then go on to serve and handle the food, Our food was practically cold by the time we sat down at the table ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great place for a burrito,The steak/chicken can be very spicy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will continue to visit this Chipotle because the food is of good,For this reason we almost always do the online ordering and then go and pickup our burritos,probably 80% of the time we arrive at the specified time only to find that the burritos haven't been made yet,quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and then hands the bag of food to the two girls that walk in the door ,I don't think they even paid for the food,I had to then wait because the manager jumped the line to make two tacos for his friends,draws some hearts on the bowl covers,in the part of the line where they add quac/sour cream/ those things,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast line and prices are good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is usually the same old wanna be mexican food no matter which store you go to,Maybe because it's the only one in a 30 mile radius so they put extra care into their guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
consistently tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
clearly the Mc D's level of food thoughtfulness is present,I'm always looking for a good big veggie burrito,that's not sayin much cause so far I've had more fan faire veggie burritos in this town than I can list,) rice,The rice ,(I got the brown rice,Perfectly adequate fast food that can be healthy if you avoid dairy and meat,It comes with guacamole,and taste much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got a steak bowl here ,and most of the steak pieces were those fatty/chewy,get some better quality steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Slowest chipotle in cbus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they get so busy around lunch time but still serve great food with a smile :,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a burrito bowl with steak,The steak was so fatty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rancid meat from the outside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Constantly forget sides/chips/guacamol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is very consistent,but the food remains excellent,so we can always count on everyone in the family being able to eat here because the orders can be easily customized and the food is freshly prepared,The flavors are great and I love the customization of a burrito,or at least get guac on your burrito,My favorites are the chicken (tasty,ALWAYS get a side of guacamole and some chips,We also appreciate the use of organic meats,and if you avoid the cheese ,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Saw employee put food back in the hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a chicken burrito bowl ,I eventually stopped trying to even eat the chicken because I was spitting out connective,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food that is,food is great,out of the peppers and onions and soft shell tacos,I love chipotle,First time it was chips ,they pretty much seem to be out of chips 50% of the time after 6pm,Second visit they were out of chips ,With so few ingredients on the menu you would expect them to maintain a full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and tonight there was a 30 MINUTE WAIT for white rice,Other Chipotles have given free chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can pick a burrito,Cheese dip is also not worth because it's overpriced for how much,I usually order a bowl,bowl or salad,I usually just point to what I think looks like chicken,Then you pick toppings like salsa,Then you pick a meat from whatever selections are left,cheese,lettuce,not sure if the quality is actually better or they just say it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love my chipotle wherever I go,Staff is friendly and my steak was hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 A customer in line in front of me asked for more meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The people making my bowl couldn't hear anything I said I guess because they put multiple,things in my bowl I did not ask for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are excellent, One of my favorite places to go for a burrito, The only reason they don't get five stars is because they don't have many options to go in the burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For that reason I recommend chipotle ,Although I can't give any additional stars I would recommend that you try chipotle to form your own,They pride themselves on severing sustainable meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the rude cock-eyed lady doing my bowl snuck it in my bag ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't expect generous portions of food at this location as you can at many,"It's more important to go ""by the book"" then provide friendly and generous portions of food at this location",you better believe they're measuring their meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
say extra chicken,or guacamole - you may or may not be happy,Food quality is top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great burritos ,and the price is affordable,I like the fact you can also get a bowl ,I love the chips with their lemon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no tacos,No chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their steak is soooo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good food,and well priced for the amount of food,The food was so fresh,This chipotle is located off Cobb parkway next,I came for a quick dinner because I've been craving chipotle for a while since we don't have one in Chattanooga,I ordered a salad bowl with half chicken ,The bowl was piled high,I also ordered some chips ,My chips also didn't taste fresh,and steak with all of the goodies,The queso isn't your normal white cheese queso , to chick fil A and corner,I was also really disappointed because i didn't get any of the awesome vinaigrette for my salad, and still delicious without it ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had to give them 4 stars because sometimes my food isn't as hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
foods,but the last thing I want after waiting in that line is for the person scooping rice to get annoyed with my request for double,rice (I only get chicken ,and rice),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tastes exactly like every other,it took more than 10 minutes to get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love me some chipotle burritos,Beware: their burritos are HUGE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of food at this location has never disappointed,delicious burrito bowls,and use that on your next burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came here on a weekday afternoon- around 3:30 when there was almost no customers here  (but plenty of employees) and still ended up waiting a good 10 minutes (after my food was prepared)  for someone to work the cash register,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the rice was not cooked ,the rice was formed into big,I ordered chips ,and was equally disappointed by the bland taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everyone's food was just there in the counter getting col,Oh and one of the girls made my burrito into a cubed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My Chipotle obsession has definitely been taken down a notch ever since my first encounter with this magnificent new-born baby sized burrito chain,ingredients always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a burrito fajita bowl also absolutely perfect,I got a chicken quesadilla the first, I got TWO huge quesadilla filled with delicious fresh chicken grilled to perfection with melted, yummy cheese with sides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wasn't loving the way my first bowl was put together & he practi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should know what to expect (I LOVE Chipotle burritos),I felt like the burrito artists were a little,all the trimmings) which usually means the burrito doesn't close properly,stingy with the toppings as I pretty much get everything they offer (hey I like both beans and both rices ,and two meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best chicken burrito I've ever had,Fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they offer other things besides burritos ,and bowls (burritos without the tortilla ,I'm gonna continue my quesadilla purchases at Taco Bell since quesadillas here cost as much as a burrito (starts at $6,Chipotle has been less generous with the rice,They now offer brown rice ,You be the judge of whether or not that price is worth a dollop of nature's ,and in a bowl,I ordered a chicken quesadilla because I had seen someone order it before,It's literally nothing more than shredded cheese and chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After 15 mins i reached the front where I the food bar was visibly soiled,I had to shout aloud my ingredients because the girl couldn't hear or understand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am a pure vegetarian and after eating some food in the bowl,I don't want my food to be mix of veg,He offered me another bowl free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were out of white rice, You're open until 10:00 but already out of one of the ingredients that goes into every single,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think they do a good volume so the ingredients are not sitting out long, For a inexpensive dinner with quality ingredients i would def recommend this Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First let me say when they have all the toppings the food is great,Tonight I came to get a veggie burrito bowl to go,I order a burrito bowl with veggies n a side of guac ( guac is free, with veggie bowl,this is what my bowl is primarily made of ,and guac is 2 extra dollars if not included in bowl,so I am getting ripped off majorly if my veggie bowl has no veggies or guac,always am squinting as I walk up to door hoping it doesnt say out of guac or salsa,"The door said ""sorry we are out of chips"" (In my head I'm thinking coooool not ordering chips",I guess in place of meat),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is not real mexican food by far its the worst food ever it has no flavor second,chance i give it all they do is fill up the bowlds & burrito full of rice & 2 oz of meat if you really want real mexico food check out el,tenapa on north obt and olso taco express also north obt these are genuine mexico food i call them the wholes on the wall, real mom and pop joints close the doors chipotle your food is really bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is my regular chipotle location,I am here at least once a week they have had a lot of turnover in their staff and it has definitely affected the outcome of their bowls,not-drained beans,but it is convenient and and delicious so I'll keep coming back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Still good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it was so refreshing to have friendly people put my burritos together this afternoon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
me I'll be seated down the street enjoying my food with unlimited,It's the subway of burritos nothing special,but I definitely would of had a better burrito ,Skip the seat grab your burrito ,I thought hey why not try something new I've heard all these great things about chipotle,I will be crossing chipotles off my list, fresh salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went in and they were out of the steak I said I would wait ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got to see how the bulk food is delivered to this location,It was so jam packed with food that the driver had dirty,shoes on top of the food,I got to watch this all happen as I was sitting by the window eating my food,It's newer an the food is always fresh, It made me throw away the rest of my burrito ,The Barbacoa meat they put on this time was one large,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle offers consistently good fresh food at all its locations,Remember to try their burritos ,and tacos,Their spicy salsa can be real,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While the food was excellent, While the food was good,There were no chips,I've experienced consistent quality from TX to NY ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While it was nice to just walk in and have them hand me a bag with my food,Cold food,I ordered a veggie bowl ,Very skimpy on the black beans as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location obviously makes all of its profit by skimping on the amount of everything they put in your bowl,I paid for double meat ,I have less than what is normal for a single meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
adding a vegan burrito to the menu ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the food ,unorganized and low on food, For a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was food that was affordable, It's pretty uninspired food, People remarked on the size of these burritos, I remember the burritos being larger ,Chipotle offered a free burrito to anyone who tried the sofritas,like low-quality TVP (even though this is alleged to be tofu,tasted , It tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are several new people working and im not sure what kind of training they went through but i watched a guy stand in line watching his burrito get rewrapped over ,It was to the point where the girl who came out from the back to help her couldnt even tell if it was chicken or steak,the beans were completely smashed,95 for guac and chips FILL UP THE CUP WITH GUAC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I love the fact that they only use  organic food ,burritos, A couple of standouts are the Barbacoa tacos (or anything they put Barbacoa on - salad,) and the chips and salsa,The chips have a lime-infused,and non-BGH and antibiotic-ridden meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great high quality food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle ,No other chipotle tries to nickel ,I understand if you want more chicken to pay extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the food is great,No beans or brown rice or guacamole another time,and only had like chicken - half hour before close,they were out of salad one time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:30 pm lunch time and the service is slow they are out of steak and chicken ,"and when I ask ""how long will the steak take"" the girl behind the counter said",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You want a burrito that's a meal all by itself,I've tried them all  the chicken burrito is my favorite,Maybe I  should try without having the chips ,and guacamole on the way home,The guacamole is second,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the burritos are pretty good,They definitely have fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is tasty,the salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were sloping the food,I paid and got halfway up the road before I realized my burrito bowl had saturated the bottom of the container ,Then I get home and the rice is not cooked completely (never had this issue),and the juice from the corn ( that was not drained off) was all over my seats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got the Carnitas with black beans burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best chipotle I've been to by far,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I eat chipotle aoccasionaly ,They have speedy service and I highly enjoyed my chicken salad bowl once I supervised the making of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But I get a better burrito from the food cart at work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In addition to the consistently yummy food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
friendly and the food is ALWAYS fresh,1/2 the rice,Chicken Fajita bowl,add black beans,tomato salsa,medium green salsa ,and guacamole,it tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pretty fast service food is always great,The employees are super friendly and can seriously get your food fast even ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had the margarita with my burrito bowl,if you whine about paying extra for guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At least the food was the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chipotle's management needs to be blamed, I used to eat chipotle atleast 4-5times a month ,but because I dont have another chipotle in the vicinity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I saw tortillas of those ordering burritos ,The tomato salsa was mashed like a puree,I ordered a salad,the quality was horrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And then the chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I work in shopper's world and this is my main source of food for lunch/dinner,I always get a vegetarian fajita bowl to go with rice,cheese and guac =] I only had the chicken there which seem just a little,black beans,corn salsa,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been to sooo many chipotle's ,Dont care if i have to drive 5 minutes or 30 i know i can go here and my bowl will be overflowing with goodness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While I enjoy the food,I do like the friendliness of the staff and the food is pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
order the food online ,and leave to enjoy my scrumptious chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the chipotle dressing is sweet,Okay so the herbs that are chopped into the rice make it a bit more complex,They'd always request extra rice ,And the chicken is Bell & Evans,This is a very good organic chicken br,If I'm going to eat chicken here,cheese and warm black beans,cover one with lots of cheese and meat,Unfortunately the only lettuce in the salad is romaine,It's gotta be the corn,I order it in the salad,Chipotle salads are good,but the salad doesn't really need it,but they'd whine about why we were at *insert delicious restaurant* instead of The 'Potle,It's really delicious until you get about 80% done ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you would think by the way this place is PACKED  the food would be amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ever hear of chipotle closing for a week or two to food born illness,anyone whos worked any form of food or retail,you can make 2 full size burritos if you 'roll your own,Everyone eating at chipotle should give it 4 stars,irs a chipotle,extra rice,Pro Tip : Burrito bowl to go is king,both beans,extra of your favorite salsas (mines the pico ,Size of scoop o meat varies from person to person day to day,and the corn) with 2 scoops of each of those,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I started delivering for Postmates today and 2 of my deliveries tonight were chipotle back to back ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The most bland burrito I have ever had,This is what a burrito would taste like if they served them on a plane,as well as salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe we've received the food from the night before or something ,This used to be my wife's and I favorite chipotle to spend a little,We are both osu students and we avoid the chipotle on campus to come to this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We did have to wait a little for out food to be done, They even called afterwards to make sure that all of our food was correct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last week I had the most amazing burrito bowl ever,I called the store to complain about the guacamole ,but the steak was way over cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
placing an order of delicious Chipotle food for myself , I remain a fan of the food, Especially when you're skimping on my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is BY FAR the worst chipotle in the entire,Sticky gross rice,beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cold food,Stale chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
workers couldn't be bothered to wipe down the spilled over food,chips,Out of cheese,Steak tastes like rubber,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burritos made sloppy,ingredients looked like they were not fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food is always fresh,The price is reasonable for the amount of food that you get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just ordered a burrito through door dash ,especially when you spend 25$ for a burrito ,and a bowl to be delivered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Chipotle and their food,When I got to the register to pay one of the crew members grabbed my burrito stuffed it in the bag ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went in to pick my daughter up a chicken burrito ,and chips and salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't get too fussy about the waiting line since I know they all want food like me,Nice for on the runs though or as a stop by place for food before returning to shopping in the plaza,not as fresh as the chipotle locations that are neighboring grocery stores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito wasn't even rolled at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The barbacoa burrito is the best,the lady dumped the oily leftovers from the pan on my burrito ,And maybe everyone needs retraining as to how to wrap burritos better,I love chipotle,The amount of meat I got was less than can fit in my palm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and food was seasoned ,it is not a good or true chipotle experience, This place is a waste of money and an overall bad chipotle experience,*written by a true chipotle lover who would eat there 2 or 3 times a day if given a choice, They will actually give you a few pieces of meat ,They skimp on seasoning too and their meat is often dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Portions and food quality are wildly inconsistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time i go to this location something is always wrong with the food,food is too spicy (which i never ask to add),or they are out of food,Either the rice is undercooked,the rice was so salty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,She herself does not have any food ,are they in line ordering food,All in all the food was decent,We got our burritos (my daughter got a quesadilla,WAAAAY too much rice in the burritos,I ordered a chicken burrito,not a rice burrito with some chicken in it for flavor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
slow service and the food was craptastic,In a town with a thousand awesome taco places you would think they would step up their game,I hade the steak tacos ,and I can safely say I have never had such tough pieces of meat in a restaurant,The steak was so chewy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the quality of food is what you would expect from a Chipotle,the employee that put together my burritos the past,when you're done with with a Chipotle burrito you should be hating yourself,Both times I've gone there the burritos have been underwhelmingly small, two times apparently has no concept on how to portion out the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food itself is what you expect (#awesome) ,but enjoying the food will not,Do yourself a favor and get some guac and chips next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AND our three meals are basically inedible because the rice tastes ONLY of lime, Chipotle used to be (I mean years ago) so consistently delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also love the taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a big scoop of the item lands in your bowl (you wonder if they even knew the meaning of little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's also not sanitary for him to have all of that hair hovering over the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my food has sat at the registered for several,liquid from my bowls seeped through the bowls , At teast the first time I noticed and made them use another bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also when I got my burrito bowl to go,the chicken was  completely burnt and black and ruined the taste of my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you choose your meal type and just go down the line telling them what to put with your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not burritos,They were out of burrito lettuce,Probably the worst chipotle location I've ever been to,the worst chipotle I've ever visited,They ran out of chicken,Even though they were busy cutting up freshly cooked chicken,Being out of chicken for a few,AND they couldn't just cut up enough chicken to start the line back up with the couple who were waiting with half made dinners for chicken,They all stood and watched the cutting guy cut up the chicken,Had to ask three times for extra cheese,I was informed that the lettuce was for salads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We love the simplicity of the menu - get Burrito bowls exclusively - food is always super, fresh - only 2 complaints - online orders are never ready and they are starting to skimp on the amount of meat they include - we frequently have to ask them to add more - else it's lookin more like a vegetarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for two bowls ,I ask for two bowls ,The lettuce she gave me a couple of str,corn,LETTUCE which is the cheapest thing of all the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He brought me my food quickly ,I had ordered my meal through the chipotle app ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The burrito was cold,the cheese unmelted and the burrito poorly wrapped, The service was the slowest I ever had at a burrito place,the chicken was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't mind waiting a bit for my food,But I would like consistency in the amount of food I'm paying for,For these prices,I like to order a bowl ,especially for the meat,especially the meat,I had to order double meat,the utensil used to dish up the meat may have been different,I give Chipotle props for labeling their GMO ingredients on their website,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is my #chicken and rice bowl,Besides that fact that #Chipotle gave me over cooked mushed rice she decided not to give me chicken either,I told them I wanted everything on side they put it all in bowl,#Chipotle after me asking her to make another she proceeded to take chicken from the old bowl with sides in it ,and put in back in the line with the cooked chicken to serve to other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food for an airport ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They seem worn out from scooping a spoon of rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For whatever reason this chipotle always seems to be poorly managed compared to others- the line moves very slow,the chicken was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd like to say this review has nothing to do with the food,The food was good,After the girl made my tacos,My tacos were made ,I'd go back to chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 You can't beat the speed of placing your order and receiving your food," I love their Burrito Bowls--containing everything that would be on the ""inside"" of a burrito without the tortilla", I love their guacamole and corn salsa, My biggest complaint is that they charge extra for chips and salsa,and their salsa isn't even that great, Their meats are hormone-free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always order the same thing: chicken fajita burrito,"Tthe cilantro-lime rice had neither cilantro nor lime - when I asked if there was cilantro I got a rude ""no"" without apology and it wasn't until I ate the burrito that I realized there was no lime either",In the end I bought a burrito that had no taste ,This contains 3 main ingredients: rice,chicken,It's a miracle they had chicken,It is almost guaranteed that they will be out of at least one ingredient (of 3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every once and a while I stop in and get a burrito bowl with lettuce (,and basically make a taco salad),and if you want guacamole,Did I mention that the guacamole costs extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Took twenty five minutes to get through the line and pay for our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm giving 5 stars for the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fresh,I decided to try chipotles because i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Especially the rice & beans,Now usually Chipotle is skimpy on the meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Love me some chicken burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food at this Chipotle is pretty typical,to the food you'd get at any of them,and the quality is consistently okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food ,I used to devour huge burritos ,so in recent times I've chosen the burrito bowls,when compared to other burrito places,Rice and black beans always make an appearance ,While it slightly peeves me that chips are not included,Chipotle's chips come out on top,And that pricy guacamole is pretty,Quite fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Although their food is fantastic,My burrito bowl today was missing cheese, sour cream and mild salsa,Of all the meats,The guacamole is great,And it had lettuce,Last time they put lettuce on it too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is pretty,the lines are typically significantly shorter than any other chipotle nearby (gr,I recommend for all chipotle lovers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But then my friend recommened getting a rice bowl,I got the chicken rice bowl with black,The prices are reasonable, beans,and salsa,I also got the chips and salsa,I also got the chips ,cheese,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they were rushing my husband and I with our order and almost all of the food was gone,They didn't serve us as much as other chipotles in the area ,The chips were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just make sure you get a chipotle salad,My most unhealthy days include white rice,I get a salad with chicken,This location gets 4stars just because there is something noticeable different the way the perimeter mall location seasons their chicken that makes it tastier,black beans,corn salsa,and cheese,When I'm eating clean I just lose the cheese ,sour cream,and sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pulled pork burrito is my fav & the chips are awesom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You should never be using a wet dirty rag and wiping down the counter next to food that is being prepared,The dirty water from the rag could splatter onto the food,I would not recommend this chipotle at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The place just gets crowded and dinners and people waiting for food collide,The food is like any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Settled on corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I guess when you experience great food ," The ""rice and beans"" guy was scraping the bottom of the rice pan when I walked up and asked for a burrito bowl",I MEAN burrito bowl, Instead of getting a new pan of rice,he managed to scrape up about 1 and 1/4 spoons of rice ,"""rice ","black beans"" to which he reached into the vat of frijoles goodness and got one meager scoop of beans laden with ""juice"" and plopped it on top of the rice",by this time a seasoned employee had replaced the rice with a fresh,batch and taken over rice station,"I kept hoping ""rice ","and beans"" guy would put the bowl down and let someone else take over my bowl's assembly so that I might get a little more rice ", He lifted the steamer machine thingy and started to put the paper bowl in,and squish it in the bottom of my bowl,"and his friend (who apparently was also new) at ""toppings"" station took over my predicament bowl", I asked for chicken,"and beans"" guy said ""Beans","and beans"" guy was giving me the tour of the ""meat station"""," ""Rice and beans"" guy stopped at protein",about an ounce of salsa (SCHERIOUSLY,and a mountain of cheese,then a big ol' helping of sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Crazy busy during the week but the line moves pretty quickly even when they run out of beans and rice,One pet peeve was on my recent visit and they were out of black beans ,and they kept pushing me to put my salsas on before adding the beans ,and they didn't understand why I didn't want to slap hot beans on top of my cold,salsa ,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our food was decent,I had a steak burrito bowl with guacamole on the side (the guacamole is an additional,The rest of my party had a carnitas burrito ,and one brave sole had the crispy tacos,My friend that had the crispy tacos,order sour cream with her tacos ,this made her taco shells soggy ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then my friend traveling next to me had double the food in his bowl ,They also were short on other items so they made my bowl the emptiest I've seen at any other,Also short on onions so they was non in the corn salsa,They were out of chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Chipotle food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let me start by saying I do like chipotle,The only thing ready to go was the chips because they are pre,not even the sides of guacamole we paid *extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My sister ordered her food,The food itself is okay,When she opened up the container for her rice bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I hate when the employees are stingy with the food,We got two burrito bowls,and guacamole with chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have to put my own food in the bag,now once I pay they shoo me along and ring up the next customer while I'm still trying to grab my food,When I first started coming to this location my burritos were FAT,my burritos are smaller then my h,I always get plain white rice because I don't like lime ,I always have to ask for like 3 scoops of rice because there is never any,and they put maybe 3 grains on it and then slump on the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the servers were a bit heavy handed on the ingredients- I love ,the guac tastes like a million bucks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First for me - out of guacamole,Can't ride on fresh ingredients soley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the boys making the food are friendly as well and do their best to get all my toppings gracefully into the three crispy taco dish I always order,I am giving this place five stars because its probably the best fast food for the price in Vancouver,I'll never try any of the other meat filling because I don't believe there is anything out there that tastes better than the steak,the steak is incredible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe the sour cream and guacamole aren't so good, for watching calories but the taste is oh so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food is delicious,By far the best tacos,This was the first time I ordered chipotle using DoorDash,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food nut,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My order was missing salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't know if the food is real,But sometimes i like to eat a burrito,and chipotle is really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not amazing like the food trucks ,and I can choose what goes on the tacos (,and on everything but I like the tacos),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every table had food scraps on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I spent years working in the food service industry - that's bad,and - without fail - one of the key ingredients of my meal is scraped from the bottom of the pan,It is amazing how much Chipotle quality can vary by location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Solid food,I also ask for sour cream on the side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the quality of their food ,After getting our food I searched unhappily for a table ,We had to find a place to set our food just to take the chairs off the table,I LOVE chipotle,I always know I can go to chipotle ,I also went on to ask her if they served the sofritas because I was very interested in trying that after watching a documentary on chipotle ,This honestly was the worst experience I have ever had at a chipotle,We went up to order food and I had asked the girl the difference between the bowl ,and the salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The workers are so greedy about the food,This chipotle sucks,mainly the rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lol well I just sat in line for 10-15 minutes only to be told that they were done making food ""for awhile""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The server misheard him when he asked for a burrito ,"She then turns around and tells the cashier in Spanish ""ugh he now wants a burrito"" as if it was the gentleman's fault",and gave him a bowl,asks in Spanish for a tortilla then dumps his bowl into the tortilla by the register,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle I've been too,And I LOVE chipotle usually,I love chipotle usually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I wish it were accompanied by a smaller sized price,I did finish my whole salad though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my burrito bowl is HORRIBLY skimped on, I mean sometimes I'll get heaping tong-fuls of meat , Then they wanna give me a half a dollop of sour cream and a half-hearted sprinkle of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered 2 single steak soft tacos with chips ,The taco prices may be a bit pricey,23/each) for a street taco usually ranges from $1,the tacos were fulfilling ,Price: 4/,and fresh tomato salsa along with beverage,The chips on the other,I had probably 4 chips of the bag ,00 depending on what meat you get,and had to toss it for they were too salty for my taste buds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited for close to 45 minutes before I got my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Years later and the burito bowl is a favorite of mine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Someone should train these people on how to make a burrito,A friend picked up my burrito for me,Eating sour cream or lettuce by themselves on a flour tortilla is not an appetizing way to eat a burrito,then the rice,all I hit was steak,When I ate through the steak(hot,then the sour cream(cold),then the lettuce(cold),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've had to return to the store multiple times to switch out stale chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While their food is pretty good,Another thing that has happened on multiple occasions is that we order guacamole as an add-on,they don't put the guacamole on,We only discover the absence of the guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
foods mixed,This chipotle is the reason I now underst,it just has honestly made me loose my appetite for chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food wasn't nearly warm,It's a shame management doesn't keep up with the cleanliness of the restaurant when it's clear people enjoy the food,We eat at various chipotle locations about once a week,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you order online they won't fill your bowl properly ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Burrito bowl was amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pretty disappointed to go to this location tonight and find they were out of chicken,black beans,and chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unless you order carnitas and steak on your tacos/burrito, The chips are like s,This Chipotle tends to skimp out on ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Positive:  The food always tastes great, He is helping build a better future for the food industry , I never have any complaints on their fabulous burritos, The rice,veggies and meats are great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do a great job at preparing the food,Very generous on the food portions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm from socal and i LOVE mexican food,This place is the closest it comes to mexican food near Olin,I love chipotle as well so I can't say no to this bowl of yumminess,it's your typical chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fantastic,but after the third time of receiving the wrong stuff on my burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can go in order your food pay ,This chipotle is always really busy,White rice black,My favorite mean is the chicken bowl, beans fajitas chicken cheese, mild salsa medium salsa corn ,I told the person working the cashier and they happily exchanged it for guacamole,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2) Steak for burrito appeared ""pink""",not so much for burrito steak,3) My friend ordered chicken taco,The chicken they had served up was full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 If you are looking for a quick filler food then this is your place,Their burritos are okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We love the food ,The food is still great,It is corn tacos with black,So me and my wife go to chipotle almost once a week, beans and brown rice chicken cheese, and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After paying for my food,"I exited the establishment and paused just long enough to see a less than stellar ""74"" food inspection score",Due to the food score peaking my interest/concern,I walked up to the counter to place my order only to discover they didn't have any cheese or lettuce prepared,I opened the container only to find brown lettuce and clumpy cheese littering my salad,I stood around for approximately 5 minutes and was finally able to order the salad I had originally intended to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a super busy location but they make up for it in service and taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff was great and actually put a decent amount on my burrito,I love extra cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as it's one of the few places she can eat with her food allergies, Both the food person ,especially meat ,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I give it two stars because I love chipotle,Flavorless meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is my go-to spot when i'm too hungry to think about what I should eat and all I want is a bunch of food that tastes great,the food is excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or the lack of food options,The food was bland,Really boring and tasteless from the tortilla to the rice ,and beans,The salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The price seems high compared to *other* fast Mexican food,I love the barbacoa soft tacos - with a not-too-spicy,salsa verde - ,and the guacamole & chips are divine,but the volume & taste are so worth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  I bit into a rock in my salad bowl, When I showed a manager the rock she was not surprised at all and told me they were aware that the batch of lettuce they had received had rocks in it ,tell did nothing to stop or evaluate the lettuce they were continuing to sell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The workers are rude the food is never good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mainly the gentleman who prepared fresh rice for us and came to serve the rest of the food,We felt so bad that we asked for the lids and a bag to bring the food with us ,When we were paying this nice guy put the bowls in a red basket with the paper where the burritos are served,Came to the front and scold very badly the nice guy because he made the mistake to put the bowls on a red,Despite of this the lady removed the baskets from the bowls in a very rude,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The guac is a bit pricey at $2 extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered 3 soft tacos,When I bit into it the very first thing I noticed was that the taco shell was tough,"nothing like the ""real"" tacos at Taco Veloz",I think I'm gonna drive that few extra miles to get to Taco Veloz next time I'm in the mood for tacos,each w/ a difft meat (chicken,and beef) and topped it off w/ their hot salsa,I went to the counter to ask for more salsa ,and grass-fed meat,and the meat was dry,they could really take a lesson from Taco Veloz on how to braise their meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The portions are generous and the food is oh so good, The staff is very knowledgable about the ingredients used especially there are people out there with food allergies, Their rice is flavored with Cilantro , I particularly like their carnitas which is their shredded pork with black beans,and it blends very well with the rest of the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
extra rice ,extra rice tofu or chicken ,and cheese yet when I ask for extra rice,Yet this day I was surprised and I will never forget how happy Aaron made me feel for being a fluffy that loved extra rice,I hope their staff learns to just do their job like Aaron an when people ask for extra rice or items they put it in the bowl with a smile,I hope their staff learns to just do their job like Aaron an when people ask for or items they put it in the bowl with a smile,tofu or chicken ,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh,they always fill up my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,I'm standing in line now and see the cashier just standing there waiting on the food line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time the food is always fresh,but you can get a burrito a burrito bowl or a taco,You can also get quesadillas or tacos,I have never been disappointed at a chipotle,I think my son's girlfriend would love to go to chipotle heaven, salad with chicken,guacamole and salsa,They also sell chips, hot and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Their line employees are putting out so much food so quickly that they don't care how unpleasant, If I had the opportunity to ask for them before my food was passed,There are way too many delicious food options in Portl,which required the (apparently) difficult task of sliding my burrito back to the previous,which she proceeded to ladle into my burrito,and the burrito was so spicy, Now onto the salsa,I asked for a very small amount of spicy salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only people who work there rude  but also their food is not consistent,So back to the food,If you guys think that this place have good people working and they have good food,then you might want to check out  Buckhead or Forum Location and see what you think about that food ,and never had problems with chipotle,one day they put too much rice ,another day they gave me almost not rice ,and less rest of everything (talking about their bowl),They do not ever put cheese in kids meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always order the salad bowl but in this particular location I'm only paying for lettuces and rice,The other portions specially meat are absurd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just because I order my steak fajita burrito online ,and can't watch you make it does not give you the excuse to put NO STEAK in my burrito,I'll just find another location for my burrito fix,The rice is undercooked,The steak ranges from chewy ,and flavorful to WAY overcooked and tasteless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
salty food,When they just opened was the best place to get burritos,and very small burritos,old chips,you have to dins the meat with a magnify glass,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As a Burrito lover and burrit up survivor  I can say that of the burrito places in the area ,If you don't want a burrito you can get everything as a salad or just in a bowl,Their guacamole is pretty good as are the nacho chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its good to just go grab food with friends,its chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food at this location in terminal A was terrible,The meat was unseasoned, and tasted like it had been sitting out for awhile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food is typical of a chipotle however service was very slow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been to places in Alston and Brighton that serve the same food the same,it means that food behind the bar is moving instead of sitting there under the hot,If you go during off times you still get good food,unlike some of the other Chipotle's I've gone to this one I can get a Corona with my burrito,guacamole cost extra,Avocados cost almost $2 per for quality ones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got food poisoning at chipotle,Used to love chipotle , twice from the chicken ,Tainted meat ,and lettuce is real,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and their selection of burrito stuffings was lacking,Southwestern styled burrito (don't get me started about Moe's--the worst of the 3),they serve steamed rice with their burrito (although I doubt it's healthier for you,make sure to pay extra to get the guacamole in your burrito,But that's stretching it because these burritos,they probably use a ton of salt in their steamed rice),Some people hate the rice,I love the rice because I'm Asian,They also give a choice between fajita style or beans style,They gave no free chips,Now I don't mind the non-free chips,The meats,And they have corn as a stuffing, taste slightly better,That also gives it an interesting taste ,at least they taste good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not the holy grail of food everyone talks it up to be ,All in all solid food though ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is quick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I get consistently tasty food here,And the food is always fresh,I get two meals out of a burrito or bowl,The staff also lets me add all the salsas I want to my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
salsa,Ive always said if I can combine the freshness of chortle with Moves concept that would be great (free chips,This location looks as if it uses can corn vs fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle ,I ordered online one time and did not check my bowl before I left ,and there was no meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very less meat ,and even less guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The guy servinig food had dreds ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is amazing, Often the chicken , On the rare occasion that the chicken ,and steak are dry,and steak aren't dry,The quality is very inconsistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They kept running out of food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have ate at chipotles in the last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got a burrito bowl,The rice was hard,Forgot to give me the chips,When I got the chips,the chips were soggy,The steak was too undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the amount of food they give me in my burrito bowl,Good thing it's chipotle and the food is good,I always finish my burrito bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Update: customer service seems to have stabilized but the food (veggie) dived down from below,I've gotten pieces of meat in my veggie food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I could get the food the next,who lets the food go out looking like that,I know this is a fast-food,but I've worked in fast-food before,I see that my sofritas-vegetarian-with guacamole order (which is *correct* on the bag) is actually some kind of mystery meat with sour,cheese,and two little strands of lettuce on top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good ""fast food"" option versus the food court upstairs",pleasingly aesthetic ambiance to it than the food court as well,The price is definitely comparable with food court fare (about 7 bucks for a 3 taco,but a good alternative to the food court,pork or vegetarian) and slap it into a burrito,burrito bowl or fajita,burrito,tacos (soft,chicken,black beans,and you can load it up with a couple of types of salsa,I ordered the chips ,The chips were terribly over-salted,and homemade guacamole as well (about 3 bucks for a rather small,cheese,sour cream,salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle I have ever had,I love chipotle ,It was a salad and it had maybe two bites of meat and its was drenched in some liquid and they also forgot to give me chips that I ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,and are always extremely careful with making my bowl gluten free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They made my husband and I two quick burritos ,It's probably the best chipotle I've been to ,It's always delicious,Chipotle is one of those places that always seems to stay consistent taste wise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have to go to Moe's now for a convenient burrito that I won't like as much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even the rice was good,I think the rice ,there was a decent amount of oil at the bottom of my bowl ,and chicken had more oil than usual,all of the ingredients were fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always find their food to be way too salty,Just think what it would be if you had the burrito,With one bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is hands down the worst chipotle I have ever been to ,the chicken was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The place was clean and efficient and the food was tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same food as every other,Nothing beats a burrito to keep you going during night class,I wish I had a burrito right,Pro tip: you can get free guacamole in your veggie burrito,Same prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ppl preparing the food ,Weather your getting the bowl or a burrito or a salad you'll send your tastebuds through the roof,The guac is amazing on burritos you much,The chips ,and guacamole are awesome but I think there can me a little too much salt on the chips,With all natural ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food wasn't fresh,Worst chipotle store ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just love their burrito bowls,go out and try a burrito right now,fairly speedy service from the friendly staff and the prices are reasonable,Their ingredients are fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fresh ingredients & the guacamole is pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food ,and will continue to frequent this location because it's close to home and the food is tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can't remember the last time our food tasted good,-rice is usually cold,- chicken is often burnt,- they frequently undertook the beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hands down the best food around,so don't be afraid to ask for loads of extra rice or beans,mcdonalds no longer owns any portion of this chain (they are 100% independent) and you can ask for extras of anything with the exception of gauc and meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was mediocre,I had tacos and a burrito,My burrito was filled with more rice than anything,It tasted like just a rice burrito,the meat wasn't seasoned,you couldn't even detect the little bit of meat in there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
two of us ordered identical Barbacoa burritos, In another burrito,all the sour cream was at one end of burrito, In the Carnitas bowl,they forgot the black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hate to say it but if your over at the courthouse or just seeing a lawyer or just u just love in the s high street craven for a taco bowl or burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
many times forgotten dressing for salad bowl even it's on the order printed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can submit your order online and have the food waiting for you,Exactly what I'd call food for thought,Some people just want  a burrito,But people like me want the burrito +,I usually stick with the vegetarian burrito bowl which is pretty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Subway of burritos,My tacos literally fell apart ,The street trucks do better tacos for less price,and it was more of a salad with soggy corn tortillas,they seem to carry quality ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and really don't care for the food at all,limited burrito toppings,the burrito makers totally don't listen at all during the lunch rush - if you just want a little,""" I forget and ruin my burrito bowl every time",else you'll have a bowl full,I'm always forgetting the corn salsa is not medium,The chips are not included in your meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food tasted very fresh, Can't beat it for a quick burrito, and I especially like their barbacoa meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still it doesn't take away from the fact that it makes great food,rice,I frequent this location frequently for their Barbacoa Burrito with black beans,mild & hot salsa,My only beef with this place is that they charge extra for guacamole,cheese,sour cream ,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Any booth that was not occupied was covered in food,My husband and I enjoyed the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We order online frequently and our food isn't ready,there are people in line who get their food before us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle ever whole staff is incompetent and can't make a simple burrito place should go out of business,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I always order half chicken & half pork (was charged for double) asked for extra sour cream (with a ""look"" as if I was taking food or money from her personally","we've returned cautiously for these past 2 months with hopes of ""The GOOD ole chipotle way"" ",rice has gone down from approx,) Second rice bowl, Rice bowls are the usual,so NO lettuce,she could give us a side of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food portions were also generous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,but we'll have to see if the quality keeps up once they're up full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're either out of chips,I usually have great service and fresh ingredients at 9/10 Chipotles I visit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,they raised their guac prices, There is something off with their tomato salsa recipe (weird aftertaste) and it kinda ruined my veggie bowl,but I have to get my meat somewhere else  now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""clean"" food",but I hate the food,burritos,It's dippable and can be added to tacos,They don't have salsa either,pico de gallo and hot sauce are not salsa,A Mexican place that doesn't have nachos or salsa ,I just can't get over the fact that they charge for chips that,and charges for chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We moved and began watching others sit on the left side of the restaurant and unpack their food until she came around ,My recommendation - don't go to chipotle after 9:00 the employees want to go home ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Are they telling the workers at this Chipotle to give small portions of food,I was given very small portions of even the rice ,and beans,"Although I ordered ""extra meat"" ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,it was delicious and the food was pretty fresh,The steak burrito was good, and the guacamole and chips were terrific,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,OK price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have been to plenty of Chipotle and as always the food was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really like it when i get to see the workers make the food in front of me,You can have it in a roll or in a bowl,You can pick what ingredients you want in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The burrito was OK,I wondered if it changed daily based on market price,with the exception of the boring and dry white rice (they claim they're testing brown ,but with Anna's Taqueria and Boca Grande nearby in Brookline offering a better product (and BG more variety) at a lower price, I was also disappointed that refried beans weren't an option," When I saw ""meat"" listed","I was also put off by the stainless steel containers with minimal amounts of 1/4"" square meat", I couldn't help but thinking all that surface area and small interior was going to mean dry and dull meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They suck at making food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or to the fact that they constantly run out of ingredients ,Among the obvious lack of quality control for the guac they also suffer from incredibly long wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everyone keeps talking about how great their burritos are,These burritos,the meat is never good and rice ,and beans are either uncooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a burrito on the chipotle app ,made it quickly and the burrito turned out perfectly tightly wrapped ,I got up and asked for a bowl to transfer it into ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The hubby was craving a burrito ,easy service and I know to expect that the burrito would be good,dealing with my burrito to be drenched in sauce ,and cheese on top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the tasty food is always a huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I appreciate the lack of a television because it allows you to focus on the food ,I'm a burrito fan (seeing as I'm from Souther Cali where the wrapped,I visited this location to definitely decide which burrito joint is better -- Qdoba's or Chipotle,Both sodas taste great and I don't think people really mind the drink alliances (except for a burrito head),there doesn't seem to be as much to add to your burrito as Qdoba's,and rice,The lettuce tasted old while the rice didn't have any hint of cilantro,the spice of chicken ,Every component and ingredient (most notably the beans ,"The ""dryness"" suits the beans ",and meat well ,lettuce,In regards to ingredient selection,bland taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But this wasnt as bad as their food,The food was absolutely bl,2 veggie rice bowls,The rice wasn't cooked through & i got some bites of undercooked,rice,They were out of black beans so we put brown then they were out of cheese so we waited,and & had no taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the burrito bowl is always tasty,rice,It's half the price at Willy's,and I love that they at least try to use humanely raised meat,80 for a small scoop of guacamole,cheese,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle gives chipotle a bad,Waited 8 min for fresh chicken,The chicken they were serving looked,The lettuce was purple, and the salad dressing was made incorrectly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very healthy food if you go light,Highly recommend their food,See the movie FOOD INC if you care about food integrity, on the sour cream and cheese and stick to the burrito Bol,You can also get beans ,The chips add 500 calories so stay away from them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my steak burrito had maybe 2 tablespoons of meat in it, Should've ordered a bowl instead of burrito if I knew this would've happened, This is the 3rd skimpy burrito I've had from Chipotle,but now it's mainly rice and filler in the burritos,It's a shame because I used to LOVE their burritos,mostly brown rice,The chips were very stale (and a lot less than I used to get in the bag) and barely any salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Give way too less food,They give very less so you will need to pay another bowl to make you full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting their food (obviously not ordering chicken) ,once I finally make it to the end of the line with my food,I have to wait on chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have to admit that Chipotle does not serve truly authentic Mexican food,I don't think a better fast-food Mexican-style,their burritos are FAT,You won't find burritos like this at Taco Bell or as fresh,I've noticed over the years that Chipotle used to stuff their burritos with primarily rice,you'll see what I mean the next time you order a burrito,For those of us that don't like bloated burritos,You will have four burrito choices to select: chicken,I've been a lifelong chicken burrito lover,Chipotle offers one free burrito to every customer who dresses up like a burrito (or a derivative,Chipotle can put them into a bowl instead of a tortilla,the other white meat,but it appears as of late that they've diminished this practice and replaced it with the other incredible ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
healthy mexican food,but I do love their food, I like the fact that they have delicious tofu and brown rice, I wish they had cheese dip,They have simple ingredients ,and they have some healthy ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was bad,I tried the new chorizo meat,The worst was the guacamole,It was cold and tasteless,It tasted like soap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I went up to place my order the chick dropped a spoon and flinged food everywhere,I was debating on going to chipotle ,and saw that this has 2 star and thought that was crazy since chipotle could never go wrong,won't be coming back to this chipotle locatio,I'm not even kidding when I say she gave me one scoop of rice ,It seemed like they definitely were giving small proportions to everyone because they were going slow and didn't want to have to keep refilling the rice,beans meat etc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you want good service and food go to the Chipotle on OBT by South Chase,The person there dishing out the rice must've been new,I asked for white rice she gave me one spoonful then ,Then when she asked meats I said chicken ,Next the black beans they haf there looked awful,as if they had been using the beans from the week before,and then she gives me another half spoon of meat like literally not even enough for my daughter's ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh gosh the worst chipotle ever,tomorrow sorry we are out of chips ,and guacamole,Sorry today we have no corn or sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very disorganized and dirty the food was cold as usual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff doesn't listen to your order - ask for extra and receive barely anything (cheese/sour cream)- ten bucks for a burrito filled with rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When we get up to pay for our food we tell the cashier we would like to pay for the police officers meal as well,She made him pay for his food we had already paid for,My boyfriend and I went to this chipotle on October 22,She stated the price ,We saw he got a double chicken bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is usually very good,I'm a fan - like I said I love the food,but I find whenever I order online I get a bit less quality (more fillers like rice ,and beans ,and less meat),I've tried this many times and more often than not I find the online orders are lower quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get the Barbacoa bowl,For $2 you can double your meat in the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can get a lot of food ,I just love me a Chipotle chicken burrito bowl,The cilantro rice is tasty,the chicken is good,and you get a choice of beans,They have a variety of salsa,I also love the chips, quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for brown rice,I asked for chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
never any hang ups from the food prep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got my vegetarian burrito,The usually moist and delicious rice also looked a bit dried out ,I noticed that the blackbeans had developed a dry,Then I looked at the pinto beans,The beans tasted a tad tangy,(except the guacamole,college quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh,and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can only conclude that they think they can get away with this because the customer is not watching them make the food,we were given two burritos,one burrito was normal,and the other had only 5 small pieces of steak in the entire burrito, As such one burrito was twice the size of the other, Never had this experience at any chipotle , full of steak fat,just chewy fat not steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The short hispanic woman with the bleach blonde hair doesn't know how to wrap a burrito ,She had to redo my burrito because she was folding burrito to close together causing the filling to ooze out (twice) smh,The last time she began to wrap the burrito she asked if I wanted it double,And keep in mind I didn't order an oversized burrito,she's finishing up re-wrapping the burrito ,So I called the store when I got back to speak to the manager because I thought about it and that situation left a bad taste in my mouth (much like this soggy sloppy burrito) ,Typical chipotle,I literally had a tablespoon of rice lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was fresh,chairs and food spill sticky,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Enough calories in the bowl, A big complaint my coworkers had was no free chips,I LOVE the steak Bowl,The steak has a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Been here several times and really enjoy the food,.food is good,if not a little pricey,salad bowls with the tasty, meats on top are a welcome,barbacoa and carnitas are delicious ,but I don't mind as long as the quality is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality is usually good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also loved that I could get a burrito in a bowl -- tortillas are a waste of calories to me :) ,If they can keep the quality at this level all the time -- I'm hooked,It tasted just like a pork roast that I would have done myself,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's why I'm sticking to making food at home,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Seems like they read the tickets and say ""I'm going to throw something entirely different in your bowl ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  He returned with various containers and placed them on the prep table behind the food line, I could not see the food as he added the lettuce ,he placed the top on my food container,I paid for the food ,and took my food home,I informed the manager about my food,  And sometimes the cilantro gets mixed in with the other foods, So I stated that I was calling to make sure it was not some strange item in my food,I should not have eaten it but I did not think that it could have possibly been a nonfood item,I brought the food back to the store , They said that they would return my money and remake my food,So I called for the manager to see my food ,  He had them to check the lettuce on the food line ,and told me they would remake my food,  They add it to the food , I took my food ,  I don't know if it was still in their food or utensils,  My stomach was churning the whole time as I thought about what was in my food,I told him that I needed to know what that substance was that was in my food in case,One lied about how they process their food,it would have been nice to get a phone call stating that he was still investigating or that he was not able to locate the nasty substance that was in my food,I usually order the burrito,brown rice,and brown rice to my container,I ordered a chicken bowl at Chipotle,I requested chicken,I watched him add chicken,black beans,cheese,and cheese,sour cream,and sour cream,I noticed there was a dark black muddy looking substance on my sour cream ,and lettuce, I believe he returned with new lettuce,And then he moved to the new containers to add lettuce,I noticed there was a dark black muddy looking substance on my  and lettuce,  So when I lightly tasted it, It tasted like dirt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They offer seemingly fresh ingredients and their burrito bowls especially are hard,and the dice roll that is whether or not you will get the same portioning for your burrito,taco,One person's rice dollop is another persons half rice dollop, to beat when you want something filling yet not loaded with heavily processed cheese,salad,Does that mean that the meal is high quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Then the steak on my burrito bowl is way too chewy,the ingredients are still fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The same prices as outside the airport which is a miracle in the land of expensive gross food,and they gave really generous scoops of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the burritos are getting smaller everyday,I ordered two burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even asked for a bit more and they gave me like two extra pieces of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The guy that was making my burrito was so polite,Just went in to this chipotle today & it was one of my best experiences I've had at one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time we come here we get great service and our food the way we ask,and his burrito turns out so big,We really like that there's a chipotle in this location,My husband always asks for double rice,double chicken ,Cashier was super nice and gave us our chips for free-,and lots of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The absolute worse chipotle EVER,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The burritos are big, Because I always get the burrito,the tacos are crunchy," I haven't had the fajita or taco salad or ""bol"" yet", and overflowing with stuff (you get a salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This honestly was the worst chipotle experience I've ever had,After a few bites I could tell how much water was in the bottom of the bowl from the watery rice ,"As I was checking out I could tell the cashier was mad about something because when a customer mentioned she forgot his chips she very loudly said ""Jesus Christ"" stormed into the back",and re-emerged with a bag of chips,Our chips had zero lime,I got a carnitas salad for both my sister ,I also got a side of queso and requested the salad dressing,The salad dressing wasn't in the bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Out of chicken,chorizo and steak due,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and my food was ice cold,one slow person making food,I had to stand there for nearly 10 minutes watching a person ladle something on my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was cooked thoroughly,If you have not been to this chipotle in the past,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had the chicken burrito, Everything else about the burrito was pretty good,why not either use all white chicken meat, I appreciate that they use all natural meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the place is clean but if you eat there you will smell like food for hours,One day you get a decent amount of beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And so far my food has been on par with any other,I love their damn burritos so much, chipotle location,usually they are just the vessel to get that guacamole or salsa in my mouth,they've made up for it with free drinks or chips ,And those salty lime chips,I don't even like corn chips that much,and guacamole,When you're working with fresh ingredients you have to worry about things like spoilage if you overstock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The prices are fair for the food they serve,The burritos are massive,The chicken isn't that great,The steak cubes are somewhat tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Carnitas burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have to ask for at least two scoops of almost everything because they refuse to give you a normal amount of food,Give me some damn food,If it wasn't for the consistent food taste ,the new Chipotle that opened in Perimeter mall is a nice alternative if you don't mind parking/mall food court/etc,I don't know if they underwent a management change or what but the service really makes us unhappy and dread coming back when we want a delicious burrito,when we don't feel like dealing with the hassle of this chipotle,Oh my god you have to beg them to put some damn rice in your bowl,My husband asked twice for more rice ,and quality we'd just go to Willy's every time (although I cringe using that as a comparison bc they are completely different,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He was the only one who could have gone a little faster but I didn't mind since my food was quick,I enjoy chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is fresh, The guacamole is amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both times the food was way over-salty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sustainable food at a great,but the food is consistent, Love the Would and metal sculptures taht look Mayan but the character is holding a burrito, price, I get a barbacoa salad with the vinagrette,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I like this location because I never have to wait for a long time and the food is always fresh,Great service and good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of my food fell out of the tortilla, Didn't like the overloading taste of the cilantro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and our food was stuffed in a bag,We also ordered a large bag of chips ,but we were given roughly 20 stale chips that we did not finish, the sprite tasted like soap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The salad with chicken was good,Much to my surprise this was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The prices,keep going up and the portions get smaller except for the rice,but don't make me pay $10 for my bowl bc I have to ask for a reasonable, scoop of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*disclaimer: not about the food* ,I heard one of the cooks (with a long blonde hair in a ponytail) chastising the gentleman preparing the bowls on the front, line for giving full scoops of meat for our entrees,"I can only imagine that this man was proposing that he was to ""skimp"" on the amount of meat that we were paying for ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They over charge me on price (20$ per burrito ) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered one chicken fajit burrito that was suppose,Then the burrito was passed on to the next,Two guys were trying to wrap a large burrito ,the quesadilla and my burrito done at the same,Then the guy was having a hard time wrapping my normal burrito (would have been a lot easier if it was naked like it was suppose,I asked for a small drink and they were out of small lids so he gave me a large for the same price,She asked me what beans I wanted ,No beans,I finally got to the cashier and he kept trying to give me the child's chips from the kid meal,Then the other person had a salad and the guy was trying to top it with the sour cream ,and guac but the sour cream spilled over ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a craving for Mexican food ,beans,salsa,The guacamole was fresh,steaks,cheese,sour cream,and lettuce,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This review is not based on the quality of the food at this establishment,nor the quality of customer service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 What I like about this location more so than any other one is that they load you up with food, The food always tastes fresh, I love Mexican food ,they get my bowl always nice, I've had issues with a few places that give you barely any chicken or fajita,and Chipotle for me tastes better than any sit-down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worst chipotle I have ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their burrito bowls are amazing,their salsa is HOT,you can always ask for a side of salsa,The meat is already spicy as it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and cold burritos,The portion sizes are the smallest at ANY chipotle I've ever been into,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only is the food good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is my favorite chipotle in town,If I'm in the mood/starving for chipotle then this is definitely the location I go to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:00 in the afternoon & no rice,Had to wait 10 minutes just for white rice,Moving down the line the only meat options were tofu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only for the fresh and tasty food ,I get the steak bowl with white rice,black beans,and lots of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After gingerly placing a few bits of carnitas into my bowl,She then took out a small and dirty plastic cup smaller than the to-go guacamole cup and took the meat out of my bowl ,"I can only assume this dirty cup was used repeatedly to try to ""prove"" the now minimal amount of meat was a real serving and that the now dirty meat was going to go back in my bowl",The meat did not fill the dirty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fresh ingredients with an eye towards health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 But the food is always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When asked what I wanted in my burrito I said picante ,Wow I usually give chipotle /4-5,and she put on sour cream,I said I said picante not sour cream ( they do not even sound similar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didn't even finish ordering my food they had a line of bowls just sitting there I walked out,This is by far the worst chipotle I ever been to, I think this turned me off to chipotle completely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On another visit they had messed up my nephews food order ,I'm only giving stars because it's chipotle,Like I said its chipotle for gosh,Since the first time I had chipotle a few,White rice is chewy as the brown,Which is almost the price of his whole,and were gonna give him a free side of chicken ,steak is grossly undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As I payed for my food as my burrito was getting wrapped I thought I would knock out the payment so the line would move faster,The girl that wrapped my burrito implied to to the cashier,Right  after the girl at the beginning of the line caught a attitude because she didn't catch what I wanted the first time what I wanted in my burrito ,I would advise making a trip down the street to the next closest chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Options between burrito,burrito bowl,tacos,the satisfaction of stuffing your face with cheesy meaty rice all wrapped in a tortilla,brown rice,salad bowl,or fajita bowl,Pricing differs based on the meat you choose (chicken,pinto beans,tasty green salsa,salsas: pico,steak,cheese,sour cream,lettuce,corn ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
About 6 months ago i got frozen corn ,i got frozen corn agai,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They need more chipotle all over town here,Food is mucho delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The proportions of food are always different,the staff was having side conversations about their personal lives and wasn't listening when you would tell them what you wanted on your food,but not at the expense of making customers waiting even longer and not paying attention to the food that you are making,I normally will get a vegetarian burrito bowl ,and end up with little to no beans ,and a surplus of lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
took food from new, He always gets a burrito,and I always get a burrito bowl,In the beginning the burrito bowls were so large, Primarily the change is in portion size -- what used to be an overflowing bowl is now a half-filled one for the same price,I've started putting on my order (I order online for pickup) that I want extra rice,"they've started ignoring the ""extra rice",and for a month or two it seemed to work to bring it back to the yummy bowl I'd been enjoying, The bowl was half-empty,plus a salad bowl for my daughter, Under special instructions I asked for the salad bowl to be gluten,beans & salsa,beans,"and salsa please"" note on my order",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the food ,There are many other restaurants that serve the same food,I asked for a bowl today and wanted brown rice,""" She said ""We only have white rice",they bring brown rice out,You just told me you didn't have any brown rice,and she had them make me one with brown rice,but the woman making the bowl said they didn't have any,""" They make my bowl",I told the lady who was closing up the bowl,Either they give you 3 pieces of meat,or sigh if you ask for one shred more lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The line is typical for chipotle but food seems more fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I got my traditonal order of a chicken burrito bowl ,I am always a fan of chipotle :),) and they had just cooked up a batch of fresh chicken,and was not disappointed with the extra extra corn the lady gladly put on at my request,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It was quite busy so we stood in the long line to order our food, The people that prepared our food were very friendly,and our food was prepared as we we requested, My burrito was huge, Prices are very reasonable,big portions and fair prices, Food tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our rice had a crazy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is,chipotle is amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"every single time i come to this location they have ""run out of soft flour tacos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was tasty,I had a chicken burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very gross to watch and decided to go with chicken instead,He was wearing gloves which was very pointless considering they were being put in his mouth with the steak and then proceeding to touch the meat,The man cutting steak (around 2:45 on Aug,2016) was occasionally shoving steak in his mouth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nothing is worse than under seasoned food,Makes for a sad burrito,This particular location never seems to put any salt in the guacamole or the rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I hope next time I visit I can find a balance for the salsas,It's also ridiculous that you are charged for overdone chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Establishments should be more careful with cross contamination and things like this for people with serious food allergies,Okay so I would normally never do a review on chipotle ,I am haven't ate meat in 5 years and I always get the veggie bowl at chipotle with a tortilla on the side,I will not go back to this chipotle location ever again ,I was eating the bowl ,and bit into something that had a familiar taste/texture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff member that rolled my sons burrito,I told her that I had been to many chipotle's and never have I seen a burrito wrapped like that,All I wanted was my sons burrito rewrapped,sure enough my son took one bight and the burrito fell apart,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The wait in line is about 30 minutes with one person making all the food ,I understand how it can be frustrating to be a worker at this location when you have a ton of unhappy customers just waiting for their food,There was half of an extremely unripe avocado with skin still on in my guacamole,the service and quality of this Chipotle has significantly decreased,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ended up walking out once I got a look at the food,This is the worst chipotle I've ever been to,Haven't been to chipotle in about a year because of a huge, dip in quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered her a kids build-your-own burrito which they made,they informed me there is no kids build-your-own-burrito,Annnnd it's an establishment known for burritos,when a patron orders a kid's burrito,only tacos,But nowhere on the sign does it say tacos,"I asked them to find the word ""tacos"" ","please add the word ""tacos"" to the description of the kids ""build your own",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they made my burrito,My $11 burrito could be mine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's been many multiple time the rice is uncook,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only thing that looked fresh was the lettuce they just brought out,They brought out the new stuff & just dumped all of the old crust stuff on top & started mixing them in right after I asked him for fresh ingredients,Very disappointing overcooked or not fresh ingredients with poor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typical chipotle food quality which is always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my food at 7 on the app, Worst chipotle experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went to college in the birth place of this type of burrito (Boulder,CO) and have a deep seeded love for mission style burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Where was the love I so desperately need in my food,I decided to make mine into a burrito bowl ,just being fast food or being so over priced it just ruins the experience,A bed of lettuce topped with stuff that looked like it had been prechewed just for me,Just more fast food but in this case it's with humanely raised animals and local organic ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
white rice, They did offer to give my bowl to me for free,and even pinto beans),and chips that often are either soggy/soft,dish out very small portions of meat (clearly smaller than other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I had to wait to place my order because their registers weren't open and half their food was not done cooking,I work in retail and spent many years in various food service jobs,I would have just comped the food ,all I had wanted was a chicken burrito,They finally took my order and didn't have the fajita veggies or the chicken that I had wanted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are several food stops around this area ,and after walking aimless I decided to fall back into old habits and get chipotle,There was zero chicken left,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every square inch of the floor had food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't have the luxury of waiting hours for one damn burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The good: the food was fresh,and tasted just fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got less than half a scoop of rice ,but then she filled my bowl up with carnitas (not that I minded),and beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad food ,and when I received my order I was missing the queso blanco I paid for and the tortilla chips I ordered were completely stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh,good service and great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food ia good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unwilling to be friendly or adjust a veggie burrito purchased missing all veggies because of being out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dry rice like sand,and meat that tastes like shoe leather,yes but the quality is AWFUL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is very good,I enjoy eating here because the food is not reheated from some factory somewhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they could have filled the bowl,Iceburg lettuce is not that expensive,I ordered a salad online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is by far the worst chipotle experience I ever had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had never been to a chipotle before,I had a bowl with steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I requested the salad and received the shredded lettuce instead because they were out of the lettuce that usually comes with the dish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've had an awful bout of food poisoning ,I ate here last night 1/6/2018 and had the chicken burrito bowl,Please be careful with undercooked chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle,Last time I came I had to wait 15 minutes for them to make chicken,Today there is a sign on their door saying they're out of both corn salsa ,Another time they didn't have guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ended up eating like five bites of my food ,most pitiful ass burrito bowl ,overly small burrito-bowl,that was literally DROWNING in sour cream,and even when I tried to provide valuable direction (for example: I asked for a lot of lettuce),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is pure crack in Chipotle food, What other food I ask you can you eat for lunch ,the food IS, If you look on the website the do take pride in supplying the best food they can, The spicy barbacoa meat is my fav, I even got free guacamole once,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered 3 bowls my order I had extra,My wife then check her bowl which she had the Barbacoa meat , chicken ,and her meat wasn't cut up or nothing,The meat should have been pull,meat ,but it was one big piece of meat,and extra cheese which I paid extra for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I legitimately think the food here is tasty,I CRAVE the food here which means one of two things:,1)the food is good,2)Soluble-meth-food-infusion,The food here is always FRESH,"I've always wondered why Mexican food even has a reputation for being ""hot",I'll trade up more ACTUAL food for chips anyday,the burritos are always filling,can you honestly look at yourself in the mirror and tell me that you'd be dinging the shit out of Chipotle if it were a mom and pop burrito cart in the SE area, What about if a friend of yours invited you over for burritos ,it started as the baby of a chef who wanted to sell San Francisco-style burritos in Denver, You eat two Big Mac's a day and I'll eat one Chipotle burrito,there are also a lot of NUTRIENTS in these burritos as well, So a 2lb burrito baby isn't enough,Also: the burritos here are way better than the bl,"""white rice""",I almost never get chicken anything ,when there are tortillas involved but the chicken here is so delightfully crisp around the edges , (chicken at most Mexicanish,"and the hot salsa is actually HOT (this is more than I can say for 99% of ""Mexican",you HAVE to have chips n' salsa too,If you want chips so bad take one home and use your own chips and favorite salsa,not to munch on chips,maybe you should hold off on the guac or get it instead of meat, If everyone had your attitude we would've never discovered the miracle of the cheeseburger (WHAT,) or all the Americanized mayonnaise/cream cheese-infused sushi rolls some people seem to go crazy,XXX calories of trans fats and high fructose corn syrup either, Are you the same people that are physically incapable of watching a movie without chomping on popcorn, places tastes like it was cooked in sea water),and they tasted like this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wish all my burritos bowls were that Jan packed with food,which was super awkward but probably influenced her decision to give me so much food lol,The young lady who put my bowl together was super,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was told they could remake the food or call corporate,when I arrived to pick up my food at 830pm-, it was cold and they were out of guacamole that was to be with my order from an hr ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I had to run back up and buy another one for the famished Tax Deduction who stayed at the table to nurse his chips ,On the plus side my carnitas was really flavorful and the chips had a nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the busiest chipotles ,Bad go up the street if you dont want to spend an hour at chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I paid for chicken quesadilla ,I know you made America vegetarian by charging for meat ,but not giving meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food are messy,Somehow the food are pretty salty here,I always ordered the bowl of chicken ,black beans ,salsa,guacamole ,lettuce,corns ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I find it very confusing to order a chipotle bowl while st,with chicken being dry,however I wished they gave a free bag of chips and salsa like other,I really liked their guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I do like the food,there was a live bug in my sister in laws salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
especially in the quality of the food served ,It's hard to watch someone serving food throwing the bowls,food splattered all around the food dividers,The food hasn't been stirred ,actually creating your custom bowl or burrito that has a really nasty,To the point that your bowl has hard beans or rice that is too hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the rice was flavorless ,and the pico actually just tasted like fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After our food was done,This chipotle is so slow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grabbed food for my siblings ,I asked her to load up on salad in my bowl since I didn't get rice,I repeat myself she throws stuff in the bowl ,"She begins yelling things like ""carnitas"" and ""steak"" at me",I kid you not she put maybe 3 pieces of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you don't know how to wrap a burrito--to the point where you have to double wrap every burrito--you shouldn't be working at chipotle,I remember back on the day you could be in a line of 20 people and be out of chipotle in 5 mins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my burrito nearly drowned in hot,the burrito was wrapped poorly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quantity of meat (chicken) also reduced significantly,Now the quality got drastically reduced along with behavior of the peoples/servers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seems under staffed and the crew is always in a sour mood making me feel bad for ordering food,This chipotle used to be the best in Columbus,I was so happy I finally found a chipotle in town that was fast ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which means the food is always fresh,I've never had bad food or bad,Other than that it's what you'd expect from a regular chipotle,Try the chips they are salted with a hint of lime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got one of the best salads I have had in a long,We were hungry and our tastebuds were ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the feckless skinny pretentious asshat made my food ,Didn't even cover the whole bowl with rice or beans,and skipped like half the ingredients I wanted and it turned my lunch it to a dry tasteless pathetic bowl,again I cloud see parts of the bowl,compared too the over flowing bowl I usually get,the amount of chicken I got was almost non,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a keto bowl from this location ,This was a very disappointing sloppy bowl,If I was in the store I wouldn't have paid for the bowl ,) barely any chicken although I paid for double,barbacoa and chicken,barely any lettuce (which they used spinach ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've had a problem almost every time I've gotten food here,I was asking for something on the side and by the time the ingredient left my mouth she was putting it on my food,Last time the girl making my bowl in front of me just didn't listen ,Today they didn't even put steak in a steak salad for an online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not one to complain having worked in the food industry for all of my college career ,Three times they've been out of guac and another time they were out of sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I guess the manager doesn't care about repeat business because at this location the service/food is  pretty bad,The server didn't ask about salsa or anything all 3 of my meals were cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went to pick it up not only was the order wrong but the person who gave me my food was rude,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I eat at chipotle at least 2-3,I've had bowls that look practically empty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I mean it tasted good and all but I spent almost $10 for a burrito that wasn't as big,literally shortened the scoops as they were making my burrito for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trying to make it look like they're giving you a lot of food,A lot of fat on the steak that was jammed in a paper bowl,One employee was collecting customers money then going to eat pick at chips that were being sold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't think I've ever had a better chicken burrito,I'm not a burrito aficionado or anything,I usually don't like burritos because they're generally sloppy,I got the chicken burrito,I like that they basically give you the ingredients and you can choose to make a burrito,fajita or taco with it,with the medium salsa and the rice,no beans,Also got some chips and salsa ,salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They really need to double the number of people on the food assembly line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We were overcharged for our food,and the young guy behind the counter (working on 10/12/19) did a horrible job putting together our food,he barely gave us any meat in our food,For my tacos,One of my tacos (which was supposed to have meat in it) didn't,He was more worried about his friends hanging out in the corner of the restaurant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some thing is very wrong with the way the food is prepped here,the burritos have been tasty,My husband and I had 2 burrito bowls last,This is the very last time I will ever eat at chipotle,Perhaps it was just the remnants of that noro virus scandal that plagued chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've cooked and worked in food-service for 14+ years,the burrito-line was wrecked ,The guacamole was a heavily oxidized ,the guy pressing the tortillas was rude and gave me a skimpy/child-sized portion that was 50% lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got there at 7:10 and didn't get my food until 7:50,They continued to make orders for the people in line and didn't start making my food until I asked about it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pro Tip : get a burrito bowl to go,It's a chipotle,it tastes like chipotle,As always I love chipotle,We love you chipotle,they raised their prices,or price raises,get your extra rice (free,) both beans (free,) and extra salsa of your pref,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food doesn't seem as fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this chipotle is absolutely disgusting,rice had no taste at all,the black beans were dry, the taste all together was dismal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Won't be getting food from this location anymore sad,Lettuce is old and beans undercooked,My steak is full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice, They are always slow and regularly out of common ingredients such as steak,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and they had literally the bare minimum food ,I didn't even eat my food,This was by far the worst chipotle,and no guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
completely making two burritos,filled my bowl w rice,beans & meat then set aside for carry-out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but if you get a bowl large,I don't like that you have to pay for a chip bag with veggie bowl,Becomes expensive close to twenty dollars just for bowl with queso, bag of chips should come with it,chips ,I love Moe's because of their better options and free chips,but I love Chipotle lime chips,More of a REAL VEGAN options not cooked near meat,spinach and vegan cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The manager did offer for me to bring back MY food with the receipt so they can replace my order,The chicken was dry and burnt and with that combination it changed the whole Taste of thebowl,The sweet young lady who took my order did a wonderful job at executing my order the taste just wasn't there today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No one can dispute the deliciousness of a Chipotle burrito,"The second began to put mild salsa on my burrito bowl after I asked for ""just tomatoes""",""" She then proceeded to tell me that all of the side items that I requested for my co-workers quesadilla would cause my order to ""be charged as a burrito""",I inquired to the final girl at the register what qualified a quesadilla to be rung as a burrito,""" before she had to make a whole new bowl",I realized sassy employee two forgot to put lettuce on my bowl ,but this location is enough to leave a bad taste in your mouth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came here today for the free chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so it was all cold meat by the time we got to checkout,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and by far the best veggie salad I've ever had from chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I go to this chipotle I have to wait about 20 minutes in line ,they always seem to be out or low on one of the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cold food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why is the employee making food wearing AirPods,Food was tasteless ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$30 dollars for glorified taco bell and an additional 10 minute wait for my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Ordered 2 burrito bowls,I should have what to expect when the server put barely a spoon full of white rice ,and black beans in the two bowls,plus guacamole I was charged $22 for both bowls, After a scattering of chicken in one ,and steak in the other, They definitely are getting skimpy with the ingredients, and a skimpy amount of all the other ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was st,even  the lettuce,andard taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was not a fan of the food because the beans were slimy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Theirconline system doesnt account forcwait times and you will becwaiting 30+ minutes past the due time for your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Didn't seem like there was enough green salsa,Asked for guacamole upcharge,got lettuce instead,Chips had no lime salt that I could taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mexican (white-xican) food in general,gluttonous burritos,I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I still waited an hour for my food,What was truly irritating was watching people walk in and order and get their food,while I was still waiting on food that I had ordered 30 minutes before them,my food was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is my least favorite chipotle,Got a side of chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They put my burrito,Love chipotle,So I love the chipotle hot,Well I put in the instructions for them to put the chipotle sauce on the side,""" but I had faith in my fav chipotle location",chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and cook your own burrito,This chipotle use to be the best in the area,buy ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The sofritas burrito bowl is great,I ordered a side of guac with my bowl,I thought maybe it was directly in my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
consistently has been the worst chipotle i've ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after 2 chances  I'll be sticking with the other 3 burrito options within a 3 block radius,The burritos are large,The flavors are good but I want meat in my burrito if I'm paying 8 bucks for it,The sheer audacity of their greed should be offensive to burrito lovers everywhere,even Market of choice has better burritos,upstairs at their burrito bar,My friend is obsessed with chipotle, but basically all rice ,rice ,and one bite of chicken or beef,and beans,Who in their right minds would pay almost 8 dollars for beans,Portland Taqueria is also much much better and they give you free chips and salsa (the way mexican,Skimpy doesn't begin to describe how cheap they are with their meat portions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And I tell them double of everything since they want to act like the food portions is coming out of there paycheck,I live down the street from this chipotle,rice,My problem with my bowls is every time they try to pour me half a scoop of beans,I get a Veggie Bowl (comes with free guac) or a Sofritas Bowl and usually a bag of chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You work in the food service industry ,You still wash your hands and put some gloves on when you handle the food how you are in there,I kindly asked the guy for a salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I placed an online order for a chicken burrito bowl with everything on it-,Next time I will wait in their 20 deep lunch line to get the perfect chicken burrito bowl,but I still love ya chipotle,What did I get in my chicken bowl might you ask,except beans, I hate beans,Black beans everywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff unprofessional with one actually pouring food out of a cup into his mouth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No fresh food left with 2 hours before closing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came on a weekday during the lunch rush and ordered a burrito bowl with carnitas,One of the employees started to try and fill my bowl with the barely-there,I was told they were giving me the bowl for free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lettuce wasn't added and cheese was added ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location always produces quality meals and never seem to be out of ingredients or anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the same bowl I always get at any location,the bowl was barely half,they left the cheese off all together,There was maybe a tablespoon of sour cream,8 strips of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burrito was wrapped horribly,My friend put in a QR code to get some free chips ,and guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not to mention the food looks like it's been tossed in a blender ,and put into a bowl or a tortilla,When they run out ingredients they just add more of the basic toppings (ex: lettuce) to make it seem as if everything you asked for is in there,and they ALWAYS run out of ingredients,Completely disregarding if you paid extra for a certain ingredient,I much rather come in and have the employee tell me about the missing ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our food was not up to regular-,My rice was crunchy from being undercooked,My chips were hard,We were welcomed with a sign on the door that read they were out of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Since food has not even been started I am told that i have to call corporate,App orders are made in a make shift area that is not organized and all items are transported from the main food area open,Corporate needs to get a hold of this location to improve on turn over on food delivery  - people do not want to wait 30+ minutes for their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Otherwise the salad I had was pretty standard for a chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would've probably never noticed it until the food was placed on the plate which caused the str,Not sure if this happens often as I've never noticed hair in my food before ,but I suggest taking the contents out of their container and unto a plate and pick through the food to make sure,I've visited this chipotle several,I usually purchase the bowl which does not disappoint,this time I purchased the bowl with the plan to include it in my meal prep for the next,This involved actually taking the contents out of its original bowl ,To my surprise I noticed several hair stands in my bowl as I was eating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Even though I arrived 5 minutes later than ready date the food was not ready, They only began when I arrived and that's when the cashier told the food preparer to start, The bowl was tasty, I had to wait 10 minutes for the bowl , but the chips were stale,and chips because the girl up front had some kind if issue with the chips, She couldn't find small bags for the chips,finally she decided to put 2 orders of chips in the big,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Like wtf is this the guacamole is brown they didn't even fill the bowl they sprinkle cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I was still waiting for like 15 mins before I ordered my food,worst chipotle I have ever been to,The meat and the rice were not cooked all the way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Meat under cooked no wonder chipotle always gets people sick, and my brown rice was crunchy can't even cook the rice properly common, Complained to the Cashier all he did was offered me a free bag of chips no asshole I don't want a bag of crunchy chips with my crunchy undercooked rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food ,Most of the time when I get brown rice at chipotle,the rice is hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the burrito is never wrapped all the way with food spilling out,I consistently get a botched burrito or bowl from this location,and today the guacamole had such an over seasoning of salt I couldn't get through the burrito,The chips have been continuously soggy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've worked in food service before,The gentleman who made my burrito was awesome,The rice ,and meat were everywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this was the smallest bowl I have ever received from any location,Looks like a half spoon for each ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both dudes had finished getting their burritos made ,I was in the mood for some chips for Chipotle,Since I was just getting chips,"She came out and completely ignored me even though I had been standing there since she first went into the back with $5 in my hand to get a ""quick"" bag of chips", Totally rude so I ended up leaving without any chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle flat,I get chipotle everyday ,and it's sad to see them just skimp you on meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bowl was soooooo under portioned,(see the attached photo) You can tell whoever made the bowl had no cares in the world,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the photo posted is of what is supposed to be a ""taco""",cool thanks for the overstuffed salad that i literally have to eat with a fork,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""National burrito day"" there was promotional","none of the 2 employees taking my order had any idea of the ""National burrito day"" or the free",When I started ordering my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had done an online order so I had already paid for a chicken bowl,For some reason their grill stopped working so they were unable to serve chicken,As a thank you for my understanding she gave me free guacamole and chips,I'm not super picky so I chose one of the available meats,or steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my food still wasn't ready,I still got my food ,Most of the tables had not been wiped off and here food remains all over the place,The floor had napkins and food all over it ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a bit skimpy on good stuff like chicken & beans using rice as filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Been here three times since working in the area and when ordering my burrito bowl it's been overflowing with yumminess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm kind of disappointed to even eat my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every other chipotle I've been to has forgotten,I ordered a chicken salad,The chicken was seasoned well ,They even remembered the vinaigrette that is supposed to come with a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm always a fan of Chipotle's food, I'm usually a burrito bowl fan,but this trip I got the tacos,I skipped the side order of chips (since I ended up with 3 flour tortillas by picking tacos), I got the brown cilantro rice,I'm a fan of the chicken,corn salsa,guacamole,steak ,steak,I didn't mind it so much since the steak is so spicy,cheese,sour cream ,and lettuce,but I don't mind because it is quite delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unfortunately this is the only chipotle near me with any parking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How do you run out of guacamole on National Avocado Day,One time they ran out of cheese,Almost every item on the menu has cheese on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was in a hurry so had to take my food to go,but I ended up with just as much food in my hair,Easily the MESSIEST burrito I've ever had,Didn't realize I should get a knife and fork to eat a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
over-priced salad at Panera where they have crappy,the server really loaded up my bowl,Since the only options for me we're lettuce ,so I stopped in just to get a salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got the veggie burrito filled with rice,beans,corn salsa,hot salsa,Added chips and salsa,cheese,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Theres nothing like being hungry and getting bad food,Ordered a veggie salad and got a hand full of old lettuce,Ordered a barbacoa salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All time worst chipotle experience,my chicken was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let's just saw my husband didn't finish his food ,My husband and I are obsessed with chipotle ,and when we got lost we saw a chipotle ,He said he felt like puking and my chicken quesadilla wasn't nothing special,We had our order to go and it was sloppy the guacamole was all over the container,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the foods okay,don't get me wrong chipotle slaps ,rice is often under cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location is so inconsistent and the quality of the food is not good,I am someone who has chipotle probably 2-3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today they had no chicken or fajita,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ordered a burrito bowl with guac,Until I got to chipotle,I was excited to get the guac hunter coupon for free chips ,Then I was told they were out of chips ,I wasted my free chips ,and guac coupon on half a side cup of guac and no chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On top of that it takes forever to get my food because no one is ever on the make line even though I see employees in the back everywhere ,and when they finally get to the make line an employee on break eating their chipotle is yelling at them to get them more food before finishing serving me,Every burrito I have ever gotten is so poorly wrapped that it falls apart before I ever start eating,"The employees give me attitude when I'm ordering and have even said as I was ordering ""ugh I don't want to do this shit"" and then proceeded to barely wrap my burrito without it falling about in the tinfoil",I love chipotle ,I'm truly disappointed with this chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
staff is great and food is very consistent,Best chipotle,I drive extra time just to go to this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is usually staffed by pleasant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's STILL the smallest burrito Chipotle has ever served me,extra meat,I ask for extra cheese,extra sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we decided to get some tasty food from Chipotle,The food was very tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was food everywhere,I get my magical tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the burrito didn't taste great,agreed that this chipotle is the worst I've ever been to,chips sucked ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Crazy to think my favorite place to eat is becoming a place I want to avoid regardless of taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So in the time i was there two separate employees got food before i did,Lately this chipotle has really gone down hill,Very unhappy with where this chipotle has been heade,It wasn't made and then the cashier proceeds to go grab my ticket order and not make it in order to make her co workers bowl who just got off instead of mine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I generally enjoy Chipotle's food,And on three occasions that I remember I had an ingredient simply left out on an online,The quality is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I order from this location the food tastes bad,there was a hair in my food it was blonde,Worst chipotle I've ever ate,I love chipotle I eat it all the time the cilantro lime rice is my favorite,and the rice was disgusting ,there was a random 1/3 of a onion in my bowl I'm not even kidding it was huge,Corn tasted frozen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great selection of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the little things   all of their food tasted better,This is seriously is the best chipotle in the Columbus area,Extra rice,Drained the beans ,and salsas for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$8 for a fist size burrito,I did an online order and didn't see that our burritos were just three inch,I can get a better burrito for $6,Not coming back to chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was awesome so fresh,We had the bowl with chicken,guacamole was so very yummy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I love their quality meats and their white rice,I really wish they would get with the free chips and salsa movement,The salads are really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't go to this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would never have thought of writing a yelp review for chipotle bc it's literally been the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best chipotle burrito I've had,This is the best chipotle ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she took it out on the way she made our burritos -- they both totally fell apart ,and dripped everywhere because she barely strained the beans and didnt roll our burritos together right,Obviously wouldnt even do a veggie burrito until we asked,I get really paranoid each time because I watch them drag burritos over those dirty,) into dairy and meat,They will stop everything to wait for more steak,Oh and also I have to specifically ask them to clean the area because of dairy (I'm super lactose intolerant to where a little piece of cheese or bit of sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle I've ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
barley any lettuce or rice :,I ordered a veggie bowl ,and there was no guacamole in my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Chorizo is always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I understand the revamping of stores and marketing towards quality of ingredients following the food poisoning episode,Just got home and opened the bag of chips - ,but seeing the portion size of this bag of chips is what will keep me away for sure,No chips were eaten prior to these shots,and 18 chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rude workers- I had to bag my own food once-,I used to love coming to this chipotle, terrible quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited 35 minutes for a burrito bowl,Go to the chipotle off Howell Mill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Order a bowl with lettuce as my base, Most of the lettuce was difficult,to eat because it was made up of most of the hard stems of the lettuce, There was not enough lettuce leaves to enjoy the lunch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The staff are rude and by the time you get food (,the food is cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As much as I love other chipotles I've been to,I've also gotten raw meat and super crunchy undercooked rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I do finally get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Skimped me on rice,beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Chipotle is the absolute worst one ive ever been too their standards of service are very low they have a bunch of young immature unexprienced people working there since i work at the mall i try to ho eat there when i can but every time i go there theres always an issue they are always very slow always out of everything and have to wait really long for them to cook the food u,want it and if they do have it like chicken or steak its always dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is convenient food,but it's pretty yummy as American food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because Chipotle has a pretty good standard of food this review was mainly on service,I'm so glad we didn't get a burrito since the guy wrapping the one for the person in front of us did NOT know what he was doing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They give you good servings for their nakie burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First time at chipotle ,Sorry I haven't been to a chipotle before,It also took a lot of convincing to get my boyfriend to try chipotle with me,I handed money for extra guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The sad truth is that you have various Uber door dash or other food service places that also near their orders in this restaurant can't live up to getting orders out one time while also h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have received half a bowl more than once,Luckily I stay at the location and catch it and get another bowl,I don't want to only enjoy the middle of my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I get the brown rice (better for you) , You can get a chicken bowl for 7, I think they charge too much for guacamole so I rarely get that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food just doesn't taste right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Friendly staff clean restaurant fast moving line buuuut 30 min wait on white rice on a Tuesday evening,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The SLOWEST chipotle I swear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of food has gone down DRAMATICALLY,Under cooked rice ,Overall the bowl had NO flavor,and tomato salsa that is basically chopped tomatoes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because my food is always free,I should love this chipotle,At home you eat around the hard burnt chicken until you toss what's left,Bad quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A friend of mine came over and had gotten a burrito bowl with saffrito as her protein, it was just rice , we reach the make your order station and she shows her bowl ,As she is doing that I am putting together my bowl ,This place is around the corner from my place ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kudos to Chipotle for not raising prices for us airport captives,McD next door charging over $5 for a 10pc and I can get a steak bowl ,and some delicious guacamole for a few,Line was long but they were fully staffed and had all the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff is nice and the food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The last 3 times I was there I had to tell them to start my order because I was sitting there for so long and it was clear my food wasn't around,#2 Location has never (and I am not exaggerating) had everything needed to make a burrito,I came in at 3 PM one day and unless you wanted a plain chicken burrito with just rice,Not just the worst chipotle,The last time I was there was the first time they have ever gotten everything right on the first try and that was because we stopped ordering extra items like chips ,Like guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have worked in the food industry for years ,I frequent this chipotle as it is right,What I thought was a piece of rice turned out to be the dead,I was already half way through my bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is usually good,  We always take the food home,We order a double chicken burrito which is plenty of food for the both of us, but lately the chicken seems to be more spicy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,except we had to wait at least 30 mins to get our online order because they had ran out of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Slowest chipotle I have ever been to in my life,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even when you ask for double meat it's still what they'd give you at another chipotle as a regular,What's with these guys and meat- it's like they don't care about the people and they only care about the stock price ,These guys have a serious issue with meat,If you ask for meat they give you the smallest portion humanly possible, serving of meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The freshness of the food is the best,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always order the same thing and it just didn't taste right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the worst food place I have ever had the misfortune to visit,I've waited 45 beyond my quote for food to be delivered,The kid wrapping my burrito literally took so long,and corn salsa burrito,I'm talking 20 whole minutes watching my burrito sit there ,They were out of chips ,chips,The sour cream was straight liquid ,They were out of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he glances at it and asks me if I want white rice or brown,rice,I proceed to tell him there's no rice on the whole,I ordered the Whole 30 bowl,I proceed to tell him there's no  on the whole 30 bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
line workers really acting like the food is coming out of their paycheck or somethin,Without a doubt the slowest chipotle in Columbus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make the burrito,The chips had chunks of salt on them ,the side of chips included approx,~15 chips,and tasted liked they were soaked in lime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's good place to take to go food,The steak here is good and tender they also use dark meat for chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worst chipotle in the entire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is always great,Love coming to this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The counters where the food was being prepared had not been wiped down in hours,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fantastic food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was good,Thank God chipotle taste good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prices high, for the very small portions of actual meat they give you these days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They may have great food in the restaurant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not happy with the food quality as of late,Hoping other food options come to this area soon,Last week I ordered the Carne Asada burrito with only about 1/4 cup of protein ,guacamole was old and they forgot the side of chips,and the side of guacamole was old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There were ants in the chips we received,He offered to pay for our chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is by far one of my favorite places to get food,If rice bowls ,As I am paying the one who messed up my order comes over and throws my bowl in a bag ,and salsa isn't your calling then do some soul searching ,huffing and puffing throwing the ingredient I said I didn't ask for back into the bin she took it out of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The employees are too busy talking to each other to smile it acknowledge you beyond asking what you want on your food,the food area is a sloppy,how clean is your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
took 30-40 minutes to get a burrito to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We were hungry and this food was very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My family and I enjoy chipotle,Today 2 of 3 bowls were messed up with one having missing ingredient as well as ice cold chicken and ice cold rice,Also missed the queso and 1 bag of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a catering order written on a chipotle form,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delicious food,They give good service and have quality food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I only get the burrito and I don't know what it is but the food isn't that great,The burrito was a little,If you portion it out the burrito will be very good,so I thought I would get an awesome burrito ,This time they didn't put enough chicken,I couldn't even taste the beans,so like I was getting bites of just cheese ,and sour cream,The ratios of toppings mess up the taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When i was having my food made i asked for steak ,There were also a few other things i asked for on my order and the worker replied well we don't want to bring any more food on the line so this is all we have right now for the night,and chicken ,and the girl working said oh we have chicken,I asked about the steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Like wtf is this the guacamole is brown they didn't even fill the bowl they sprinkle cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked a question and she threw my food across the counter ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expected the food to not be ready,After walking back to my office I open my bowl which is maybe half,full and the steak is cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 One was unwrapping fresh food,my hot food will be heated again at home,I'll suffer the loss of the guacamole (that part stings a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While waiting for steak to be ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first time I ordered a chicken burrito online ,but they were out of chicken ,AND steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The guy dishing up the meat let his mask fall below his nose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited in line 46 mins before I got my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get home and there's just a random burrito in the bag so they messed up somebody else's order,Easily the worst chipotle location I've EVER been to,I had to wait over 10 minutes just to get acknowledged and he puts guac and chips in my bag ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The two stars is for the food only because it was decent,All 5 tables in the middle were dirty with food on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If they are going to have a dleievery service than they need to train these people on how to properly pick up food,So I had the burrito bowl that had come,and a co worker had found a curly black hair in her burrito bowl,I will never order from chipotle again,The chicken was raw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then when I continued to order a burrito bowl (tortilla on the side) anyway,no rice,No beans,no guacamole,despite their lack of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food ,no white rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Order a simple bowl from u,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My surprise was that my food disappear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the most poorly run chipotle I've ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I then asked him to empty the brown lettuce from my bowls ,and just give me beans instead,that's when I realized the brown stuff  was the lettuce,  I kindly explained  to the boy that the lettuce is old, The  gentleman didn't seem to care that someone could get Salmonella poisoning from eating moldy lettuce,I ordered 2 salads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was a dead bug in my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,This is a decent chipotle in the area that's easily accessible,The parking can be a bit hit or miss on a Friday or Saturday night due to the crowds from the other restaurants and service places but they do have dedicated chipotle parking which helps if you can get it, but sometimes the chips are stale,I've had stale chips a few,It's convenience is really what it has going for it so I'd recommend it but check the chips before you leave,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 6 teenagers on a food line,One star for the good (albeit very very salty) chicken burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My go to chipotle location,but the flavor of their rice is better than any location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place is crazy busy and for it to be this busy why oh why are there dirty tables that aren't being cleaned at all and even when we want to skip the line it takes 40 mins for two veggie bowls ,and chips ,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the chicken is too salty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was enough for my two soggy soft tacos that had been sitting with fajita, Also out of chips, My kid's large cheese quesadilla then wasn't even melted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Out of chips,Avocado stems in guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Line up and decide what you want on your burrito,burrito bowl,or taco, What I like about this store in particular is the corner location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Didn't pack salsas on the side ,I've ordered delivery multiple times with added meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always load up on the grilled vegetables with my taco salad,Half chicken half steak,Get their chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why are you closed during prime lunch hours when every other food option is open,they also failed to give me a somewhat comfortable food court dining experience,""" while she was stuffing her face with a burrito",Not only did this Chipotle fail to sell me a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always out of salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bowl I brought home turned out to be meat,I went back taking the meat bowl to prove that I ain't just fibbing,I drive home to find that again it was not the exact online order I had selected - did not have guacamole that I paid for ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just like every other chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was terrible,I had the worst service At chipotle Mexican Grill I am disgusted of that place I cannot even walk one foot in that place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always eat chipotle ,The rice was mushy,I got the sofrita bowl via Postmates & it was the worst I ever had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of the food was as universally excellent,as any other chipotle,chipotle,Really flavorful and delicious but I'm a carnivore and prefer meat in my chipotle,However my bowl was a little,I don't want to see open space on the bottom of my bowl ,Really flavorful and delicious but I'm a carnivore and prefer meat in my ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I will use a different store next time I i want a rice bow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually order a burrito bowl with chorizo,The line isn't ever super long like most chipotles,Stop by chipotle,The rice is either brown,chicken,They charge extra for guacamole or extra meat,you can get steak,cheese,and corn to throw on in there ,I mention this because sometimes they don't add a lot of ingredients ,You have plenty of options to choose from at their bar of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The absolute worst chipotle I've ever been to,Got home to find they didn't put on the guacamole I ordered,The two women there told him that they told me they were out and gave me a coupon for free guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I bought the food ,There was food all over the counters,the guacamole was brown ,and the sour cream had cheese in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they said they ""don't take food back",completely botched wrapping the burrito,I had already paid but I was so upset that I just left the unraveling burrito on the counter ,I'm a frequent patron of different chipotle branches,Same with the guy who made the steak,and one guy clearly looked like I ruined his day when he had to fetch more sour cream from the back,I understand they were out of lettuce because of the E,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it took almost an entire minute alone to bag my food,the food is consistent,you WILL spend 25 minutes in this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered $350 worth of food last,rice ,weekend and the quantity of the bowls were surprisingly skimpy,guacamole and chips were all too salty,We ordered a special one with just the meat,and lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I understand running out of steak or chicken ,how can you just not have sour cream,but sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE worst Chipotle experience and possibly one of the worst food experiences I've had,There's already 2 people ahead of me still waiting on their food,It was not until 6:20pm that I finally have the food in hand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worker was rolling my burrito ,Unwrapped my burrito at home ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can get my food faster in any of the sit down restaurants by it,I've been in the mood for a good beef or pork burrito ,They are not consistent on serving sizes but usually give little meat but too much rice or other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered my food 20 minutes before ,and still had to wait an extra 40 minutes for my food to have missing things ,and something was added that made my food extra,Keep in mind I love spicy food ,I was starving all day to have them make my order wrong and have me wait a whole hour when people that came in after 5 minutes of ordering food go it right away,spicy( I didn't even ask for any salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like that the food is consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tasty food helps your forget the parking battle,I had the lunch bowl with white rice,black beans ,"Note that ""light sour cream"" means a slightly smaller scoop of sour","I definitely will say ""very little sour cream"" next",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a salad you see pictured with chicken,Got that and a vat of sour cream and an entire package of cheese on top,salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fast ,Although they were out of basic stuff like lettuce and some meats,and tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food here is outst, I've been eating chipotle for almost as long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Added a bunch of things not on the receipt and somehow forgot to add the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is ok,My food gets soggy,Also the food leaves a weird, aftertaste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I will use a different store next time I i want a rice bowl    ,The girl doing the bowls was surly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Too bad because the food was tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I understand there are online orders and such but I work in food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would never in my life eat at the dining room of this chipotle because I've yet to see it cleaned,We have no other options for chipotle in the area so we are forced to keep going back,Someone please help this chipotle turn things aroun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food counters were spilling over with food,They ran out of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They ran out of veggies but it only took them 3 mins to get me fresh veggies and they ended up giving me a whole bowl size of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seriously never going there or ordering food from this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chipotle in general is sooooo inconsistent when it comes to the amount of food given,just charge by weight like whole foods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What I experienced instead was a 40 minute wait for cold food that was less than we ordered,I watched 4 people come in off the street and get served hot food--if I wasn't afraid,The chicken and rice on my bowl were both cold,He ordered double chicken,"which they must've read as ""half order"" of chicken",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I stopped by to grab a delish burrito , I ordered a burrito with pinto,chicken, beans,fresh tomato salsa,corn salsa, The chips were also fresh,and lettuce with a side of queso blanco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and eat my burrito bowl,I couldn't even use it on my bowl,my bowl was HALF empty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Apparently you have to stand over them to make sure your food is correct,The WORST chipotle I've ever been to,Double steak is not heard of there ever apparently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Been living on High St for a year now and have visited this chipotle on a weekly,Whether it's the quality of employee they are bringing in or the training administered by management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Be wary of the guacamole,Found a sticker in my guacamole that I was feeding my son,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delicious bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not sure why this chipotle has 3 stars because ,And I know you can ask for a bit more of everything(excluding the meat of course) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your food will ALWAYS be wrong,Highly recommend not ordering online at this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
work surfaces are covered in the last 20 customers food,It was so bad one time they kept serving the food containers covered in filth ,and customers kept having to ask to wipe off the top and bottom of container with dried food ingredients from the work surface on it,you don't want the dried food scraps that have been on this counter for the last,Regardless just go down the road on route 9 and eat at a much cleaner and better managed chipotle and don't get food poisoning,The quality of food is also becoming an issue,I'm sure they have rules about how long food can sit out before being stored or tossed ,I love chipotle,They are walking the line as chicken has been coming out a bit stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other than not receiving the food i ordered through the app never really have had a bad,they won't have steak or chicken available,they close at 11 but only make enough steak and chicken to last,Birds out on the patio love chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If I wanted a refund I would have to call 1(800)chipotle,When I went to pick it up I was told there were no chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bowl I received was delicious,but I was disappointed to find out that the LARGE chips & guacamole that I purchased didn't come with any freaking,I decided to give just eating the chips alone a shot,and found that the chips were absolutely stale,"It seems that the special chips bag labeled ""Large"" is restocked once a month", guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is currently a pandemic and they're all preparing food with their masks down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i should've took a video and picture but instead i threw my food out,nasty nasty nasty -- never go to this Chipotle on a Sunday around 330 because she may let the bug/roach get to where the food is,"there was a roach like bug literally crawling on a piece of lettuce in front of the cashier i pointed at it like ""ma",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They throw your food together ,The worst chipotle in America,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Arrived at appointed time to pick up food,No food for me or the other,If you want anything resembling edible Mexican food,Problem was when we got home there was only one (more like a half of a taco) taco in the containers,The guacamole and chips were good,So dinner tonight was some chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is my soul food,what else do they not clean where food is being cooked,I ordered my food,be it retail or food service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a burrito bowl (the woman was in such,not putting any heart into the burritos they make,and what is up with so little meat now,I mean honestly I had to ask for more meat (,forgot the guacamole (which I noticed) after I sat down,she ended the ingredients with a mound of lettuce on top,they miss ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was kinda disappointed by my food today,the portioning of the food was sad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they'll put ingredients on your burrito that cost extra,They add so little chicken that I just ate an entire burrito ,and didn't taste chicken at all,they pile all the cheese ,and sour cream in one spot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm usually understanding during the week when it's busy during lunchtime (although other locations still do just fine with online orders during busiest times) but there's no reason why I'm sitting here waiting 18 minutes after my food was supposed to be ready,the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today they left off the sour cream and added corn salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hungry for some food at 9:15 PM ,The first guy making my order looked rather sour and made no effort actually making me a decent bowl of food,got me a regular size of food ,and filling food with lots of flavor ,Got me a sofritas bowl with brown rice,Had to ask him twice for additional beans and rice because the amounts he started with were like,and healthy since I couldn't get sesame chicken combo with an egg roll (bummer),salsa,and plenty of salsa ,and some lettuce,and plenty of  and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would like to thank the chipotle team for the excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bought chipotle to go today and was thoroughly disappointed by the amount of food, I ordered the keto bowl and the pictures show how little food I was given,25 and received little to no food, I have to say between a huge decrease in quality (something they pride themselves on) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this time it was brown rice,Last time it was corn salsa,They all taste the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This used to be a good chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the chicken here is bomb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WHILE making my food,I couldn't eat my food I was so grossed out ,and we were pissed my bf didn't eat his food either,So a door dash or someone from like an order service showed up and I can hear her saying oh wow guess what burrito they ordered,(chicken) and they all decided to not make more chicken but to put asada in the burrito ,The girl who was making my tacos was so rude,I decided to get asada and a vegan meat taco she was so rude,Also they must have turned the meat counter off because my steak tacos had a film that meat gets ,Hey guys so my bf and I went to chipotle about 15 min before closing we really wanted some chipotle ,You're not doing chipotle a favor being there, I asked for chicken ,they only had the vegan meat option ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fresh ingredients and the first time my husband's burrito didn't break while they were making it,This is the best chipotle location I've ever had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A tofu sofritas bowl with guacamole was only $9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"two employees stood there talking to the the ""burrito assembly"" guy about their weekend","The ""tortilla preparer"" literally STOPPED working after preparing 5 items and left them to the burrito assembly guy",The burrito assembly guy then squished both the burritos I ordered in such,I then asked for a bowl for my burrito because it was certainly going to fall apart ,a way that ingredients came spilling out every directions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once again I am extremely disappointed with the quality and amount of food served at this chipotle,Portions were very small once again and the food tasted like it had been sitting there for hours,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He is a wonderful and joyous employee and i was overly satisfied with my chipotle visit all thanks to Omar,If you're going to visit chipotle ,I visited this location today and was greatly pleased with my bowl maker Omar,He gave the perfect portion of all the fresh ingredients that Chipotle has to offer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
   Everyone sat and had to brush off the remaining food detritus,The food was edible,everything has changed to lesser tastier ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I could've probably went through the regular line and got my food faster than the ""convenient",I ordered a veggie bowl ,and received chicken ,and if you don't eat meat you know how upsetting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which I hope are also given young children an opportunity to learn how to effortlessly make food,So I just had a wild pit stop at this uniquely cubic and modern chipotles,I went the sofritos burito which I have had a few times before in other chipotles,sterile other than textual self promotion for work opportunities and benefits programs to keep you eager for a steady supply of chipotles from any of the many,Hope to maybe pair another chipotles,Same with the rice it was like they knew less water makes for a sturdier carbohydratic,Effortlessly these young children prepared the beans so elegantly they didnt even need to be tender,I also snagged an ice cold corona and some chips ,I took the chips on the road ,and guacamole to go,yet brittle enough to barely scoop  guacamole so effortlessly unattened,I am thoroughly impressed with the attention in detail to the preparation of each ingredient with a nice,and was pleasantly surprised in how stale they taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today I ordered double rice and double so Fritos and it was the equivalent to the price of chicken burrito with guacamole,Usually when they have in store they can make a three-pointer for half the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My boyfriend and I stopped here one night for a quick pick up for dinner and ended up sitting in the parking lot waiting for our food for 40+ minutes,they make you order online and wait out front for your food,There was only one person taking names/grabbing the food (poor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Just ordered the third burrito bowl that i ended up giving to my dog,If you love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice was hard,I couldn't get guacamole because it was brown didn't look pleasing to the eye,Food quality is terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered chicken ,and steak (full portion) and I barely even got chicken on the order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here at this location was like all the others,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1)  Delicious food,- For the quality and portion of the food,the price is a steal,Very consistent and you can taste the freshness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but lately the food hasn't been good,The quality of the food is terrible,and I had huge hunks of avocado in my bowl like the guac wasn't mixed,& 8/3/2020 and all those times the salsa is soggy,the chips are stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice was hard,She needs demoted and whoever half cooked the rice needs a new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food at this location is subpar at best,The food is passable,If you ever wanted to pay for your food ,Go to anything else and you will be immensely happier with the service and food, as edible but what makes this location the worst chipotle in existence is the atrocious,I would recommend for anyone wanting decent chipotle to avoid this location as though they were the last,The rice can be crunchy as a rock sometimes ,and the lettuce tastes as though it's been cycled day after day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got the chicken burrito with brown,There was a bone like substance in her guac and a worm thing in my burrito, rice,beans,cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the bowls were amazingly proportioned,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 or they are poorly trained in preparing food,with more salsa then rice or beans, I came for two bowls ,and one bowl was slopped over with salsa, The guy next to me got a bowl that was literally 40% bigger than mine, I  opted for guacamole which is $2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delicious bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you do not care about waiting forever or what the food quality is then this is the place for you,I get that it's post covid and all but chipotle is a HUGE company that makes A LOT of money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a burrito both times (the bowls are good,) and both times the burritos were good,large burritos are kind of my thing,I had to wait for more brown rice to finish cooking once ,Making meals pieced together ingredient by ingredient is time consuming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am disappointed about the quality of service ,and cleanliness of this place but they do maintain the consistency in the taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I picked up my food,By the time I got home to eat my food,Was in the mood for tacos,the tacos were complete,so I'm not sure what made the tacos so wet other, than poorly strained beans,I got the sour cream and guacamole on the side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as there was leftover food on them,There were birds everywhere eating the leftover food,And the food was lukewarm, and the rice had no cilantro ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There were no other customers on the order line so I was quickly able to order my food ,My food was placed at the cashier for check out,the person helping the cashier put my food in the bag of the customer ahead of me so I had no food,It appears that the customer ahead of me got additional food for free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We both ordered burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The woman who started my burrito was being very rude to the customers ahead of me,I ordered steak she looked at me and then proceeded to put chicken in my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is extremely fresh,I typically order via the app and my food is ready,the food is great,I love me some Chipotle and I know I don't have any business eating rice, I have gastro issues and rice makes my tummy, The only complaint that I have is that the workers are pretty messy when serving the rice, For the most part the guac is always available and the beans are cooked just right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is the same, as every other chipotle,but then you may not get every ingredient you want,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I haven't had chipotle in almost a year because the meat at this chipotle was all gristle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was but my burrito was insanely small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food wise,The reason why I'm giving it a 4 star because the food was a little,My go to order is always the burrito bowl,so I have ordered the chicken and steak burrito bowl with tortilla ,and sour cream on the side,it taste all the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I haven't had Chipotle in months and today's experience  reinvigorated my desire for a delicious rice bowl,- that was one of the best bowls I've ever had, My lunch buddy raves about the chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I work in food service too ,The food tastes good,"There were 3 people ahead of me and I waited about 10 minutes to even say ""burrito please""",I don't think they quiz people on burrito wrapping because the guy who tried to wrap my burrito did it so completely wrong,but I could've just gotten a burrito bowl if I wanted to eat it with a fork,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They need to take a fucking burrito wrapping class,My burrito fell apart,If you want chipotle that bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm eating a salad with a spoon today because they have no forks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gives chipotle a bad,I'm not sure why I order double meat and extra cheese and my bowl looks like I got half of each,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't come here if you want food poisoning ,Food here at this chipotle is so unsanitary,had an immediate stomach ache from eating a veggie bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tastes the same,I do not need any attitude to come with my food,it's not like I can't get the same type of food ,and taste for cheaper at moe's or Willy's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cause the food is so good,except sometimes for the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only reason it gets one star is because I like the food,the food stations are always low,If I wanted a vegetarian bowl,The chips are ALWAYS stale,What's up with giving a friggin tablespoon of meat,They are very inconsistent with the different amounts of meat they give,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food tasted awful,didn't wash her hands and bagged my food , and the chips tasted like they were cooked three weeks ago,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it seems like the burritos are getting smaller ,My son ordered yesterday and his burrito was about half the size they used to be,what's up with the mini-burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I noticed a couple of people were frustrated because they had to wait for white rice ,08 for a chicken bowl,and/or steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I definitely got at least two bowls worth of food for the price of one,The employee swapped out the lukewarm brown rice with a piping hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No fresh ingredients available and the brown rice is hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had to wait over an hour for food that was ordered ahead of time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will not be back to this chipotle again,The chips are always stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle ever,Go to the perimeter mall chipotle instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is okay,  We always take the food home,We order a double chicken burrito which is plenty of food for the both of us, but lately the chicken seems to be more spicy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes I WILL have a sour cream and cheese burrito,I understand I get a giant burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice mission-style burrito-action,and this is a pretty square burrito,I just love chipotle,My first chipotle-experience was in a Denver suburb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is consistently the worst chipotle experience,I placed an order through the chipotle app,The chipotle app triaged the order to door dash to help with delivery,they are continually running out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Employees walking through the food prep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After a rendezvous with a barbacoa bowl with guacamole,65 and never ever ever ever get the guacamole from Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great staff and good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 All the food was sitting there, I suppose that's how long it takes to remind the staff they serve food, I then brought a tiny burrito back to the office,I ordered a burrito, They were out of soft tacos, I had to request rice three different,"times because he kept forgetting that I said ""brown rice"," The guy in front of me had to explain what ""guacamole"" was three times before the person behind the counter would grant it to him",steak,He even asked the manager if they had lettuce,you can forget what lettuce is,and salad dressing that day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wrong salsa was put on ,and 2 giant spoonfuls of sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a bowl to go and none of the food really tasted fresh,The rice was hard,chicken tasted old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On top of that I'd say you have about a 50% chance of actually getting your food,Waited 45 minutes and had to cancel the order and left with no food,Slowest chipotle I've ever experienced,I feel stupid for giving this chipotle the many,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Decent price for huge amount of food,Their guacamole was incredible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who do you have ordering your food,Good job chipotle,How the hell do you run out of every ingredient necessary to make any kids meal or anything but a bowl at 7 o'clock on a Monday,Isn't sour cream one of your staples,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
worst part my food wasn't warm,Worst chipotle I've been too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chipotle vinaigrette,sour cream,Last Friday I went to this location & they were out of corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will obviously give it three stars because the food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The line was 30 minutes long because they only had two idiots working the food prep while six others stood around in the back, After getting to place our order they ran out of rice,I said we didn't need rice so could they start our order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location is always running out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I ordered a keto bowl inside the restaurant to take out,The server behind the counter doesn't know what a keto bowl is,Now granted I know the keto bowl is online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by my burrito was cold today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got the chicken burrito bowl ,and although the price is around the same,I asked for extra salsa but the bowl was still extremely dry,it does not taste the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went here for lunch around 12:45 I saw the black guy making food gave me less of a potion ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the food,Only complaint is crunchy rice once,Still tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cash register lady is handling their money and the girl making my food leaves my burrito,When I brought it to his attention about A worker who is eating in the back and walking through the front to refill his sprite and walking back with food all over his face is a health code violation,This guy is walking around the kitchen with food eating,I ordered a burrito , midway to make to go orders and ask the cash register lady to finish wrapping my burrito up,She uses the same gloves to wrap my burrito,I didn't say anything I just took the burrito ordered in Nantucket ,I also only took two bites of my burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband and I ordered two bowls through door dash at around 8pm on a Sunday,Door dash was able to give us credit back for one of the bowls ,salsas,I could do without the salsas ,pick de Gallo) including the guacamole,I could do without the  but when we paid extra for guacamole,Half of our toppings were missing (sour cream,Even the lettuce we added,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Normally at other locations my bowl feels pretty well weighted for the price,This location gave very little meat and barely any rice/beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is my absolute favorite chipotle I have ever been to,I have been to many chipotles,I recommend this chipotle to everyone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sometimes a salad dressing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tastes good,They talked fast and there were too many people there at the counter to fill the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I requested extra rice ,My bowl was light, You cannot go inside to see your bowl being prepared due,and extra black beans I received neither,First I requested a side guacamole was not in the bag,Then someone brought the side of guacamole out to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's a better one down the road in Buckhead that will offer better customer service and quality food,I clearly said I wanted a bowl to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have more sour cream than meat or lettuce,I DoorDashed a salad wanting to try the new,I opened my salad to find a giant,rock hard chunk of avocado and when I take it out there's no salad,I haven't put in dressing in it because I didn't want a soup salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only to find out that the food was super,I politely went up to the boy working and asked if they have a microwave due to my food being extremely cold,I threw my food down on the counter ,especially to people who are spending their money on food that is usually great,I asked the girl if she can add more rice atleast since she served each bowl with HALF A SPOON OF RICE,14 2019 and decided to purchase my regular order of two chicken bowls,i was annoyed by that point yet still paid $17 for two bowls that weren't even full,I was not going to pay $17 for two bowls that weren't filled,I was informed that they were out of beans,chips & guacamole,steak,had half of the ingredients that i normally get ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've worked in the food industry myself,the food,Now I'll get to the actual food,The food bins had mixed,They threw my food into the bad,and the tin was covered in food from the messy,The worst chipotle I've ever been to ,beans in the veggies) ,salsa, ingredients (veggies in the meat bins,Spilled guacamole,After I started eating I realized all the lettuce is old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From salad or rice bowls to burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She was throwing our food around ,it's a shame bc the food is actually amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really poor customer service and always out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered 2 bowls form chipotle this is what we got,We got just the meat,it was cold and tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This used to be a good chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In way of the food - you have nothing to be worried about here,but as long as I get that burrito,Chipotle is consistent and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So in the time i was there two separate employees got food before i did,Lately this chipotle has really gone down hill,Very unhappy with where this chipotle has been heade,It wasn't made and then the cashier proceeds to go grab my ticket order and not make it in order to make her co workers bowl who just got off instead of mine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Underwhelmed with this location but thought I'd give it another try after last time when they lost my online order & had run out of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Besides the food looking less then appetizing,they ran out of steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also the food was not the best,Went in Sunday match 3rd and got a burrito,The white guy with the red eye (if you've seen him before you know) was so upset that I started to top my burrito off with the lettuce ,Just put the toppings on the burrito why are you so mad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  My chicken bowl was just ok,the salty taste was overwhelming the traditional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most of the time food is ok,rice so hard I had to scrape off my burrito,stale chips,no quality control at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is possibly the worst chipotle in the country,It's baffling that corporate chipotle headquarters (which is based on Columbus) doesn't do something about this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They do not put enough effort into making my food,I just went today and the person making my burrito squished out half of the guac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The last burrito bowls we have ordered (weekly, for the last month) have had consistently undercooked rice,Nothing like crunchy rice,with some issues of quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as disgusting as Pollo Tropical is in Georgia (versus Florida) their food is still five times better than this slop,which type of rice ,"""I have double chicken",just take the free chicken,The ultimate gripe here is that the pico de gallo is frequently on the ripe/rotten side and the chicken quality is trash,and beans,"The vast majority of the stupidity lies in the person ""in the middle"" that handles the salsa",cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
plus the rice wasn't fully cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is almost never any food ready,With spilled food dripping all over ,and into other food containers,Probably one of the worst chipotle there is the one in Woubrn in pulling a close,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had the sale bowl,The wife went for the chicken version,salsa,adding guac and cheese,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today they omitted the fajita peppers all together and added a ton of chicken,black beans ,and guacamole,Last week they added a ton of cheese,I am vegan and specifically put no cheese,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location continues to struggle with quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We don't know why the people preparing the food was not paying attention,all the food was serve very sloppy,and slapping the food ,Craving chipotle for a while,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered two burrito bowls ,and one burrito tonight, The rice was hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They mix and match my order with other people's or forget half my food in the bag,they shrug their shoulders and tell my I have to re-purchase the food to get it made correctly because they have no other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Received a bowl that I will call along came a spider,yes there was a live spider in my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Door dash said it was up to chipotle to fix,The website took 3 days to respond and offered to refund and snail mail us a free bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted like typical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is very fresh,Best chipotle around,And this is by far one of the cleanest chipotles I've been to,If you like chipotle this is a great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I used to like chipotle a lot ,half the time the rice is not cooked ,but the quality has depleted,The fajita veggies  always have a weird taste to them like cleaning supplies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a togo bowl of brown rice,and the rice was not cooked AT ALL,and I could not eat the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Was out in the Grove City area for a meeting and wanted a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anticipating my food will be cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was a food-court in the middle of the terminal,We had noticed that this Chipotle Mexican Grill was offering the queso blanco dip with chips,The chips were salty ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Carnitas bowl with added roasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please see the 40% empty burrito bowl that was delivered to me via postmates,Worst of all I had paid for extra chicken too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm a regular at this chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the absolute worst chipotle location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted as I remembered/as it has always tasted,"I've been to this location prior for a ""BOGO"" burrito bowl deal",I also had tortilla wraps on the side if I wanted to make a burrito out of some of it (which I did),The associate was being stingy with the chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This location has had the most consistently  good service and great food of most ""fast food""  places I've frequented",I must admit though to be ing stuck on the braised carnitas bowl with the peen-toe beans on the bed of rice,The diet has changed the rice order to a lettuce bed,but sure to use the Chipolte Tabasco sauce always on the condiment counter- Now that is a great lunch bowl,consuming beans for lunch on a work day (in particular) can truly be a disaster ,I'll pass on the spicy  corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
especially because we were able to get our food before they closed ,We often go to the chipotle at the mall ,They had started cleaning up before close and said they couldn't get us lettuce which was very disappointing as I wanted a SALAD bowl,They also always serve smaller portions of meat than the location at the mall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hopefully the manager of this location sees this and adjusts that particular policy because forcing people to stand out in the rain to get their food is ridiculous,I understand chipotle is popular,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not much hot salsa (ordered extra)  My burrito looked thrown together, My suggestion if you want a taco is goto, Not much chicken, The guacamole was really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just went to pick up my food,what's the purpose of wearing a mask if they're not covering their mouths and noses when preparing the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,Clear path of travel the burrito had better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We got a Barbacoa bowl ,and a double chicken,The double chicken was just shy of a single,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Later that night I ended up with food poisoning,I rarely get food poisoning ,This was really disappointing as something had to be really off with the meat for me to be have food poisoning,and have been going to chipotle several,Not sure if I will have chipotle again after this,I ordered a steak bowl at this location,While ordering I noticed the steak meat seemed kinda off ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered delivery and got a salad because I love their dressing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just warn you guys when coming to this store for food,Now the food is way more expensive,I found a crystal stone in my chicken bowl, with real hard STONE in my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 get a burrito no beans what's in my burrito EXTRA BEANS,I get tacos they l put faji,So generally i LOVE chipotle ,but this specific chipotle has done NOTHING , My chips were so oily and soggy not only did it bleed through the chip bag it bled through my chipotle ba,one time my rice was so mushy, my bowl was wet,i got chicken ,and they give me barley any chicken,tas in it and not the salads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There also was someone else picking up food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was trying to support local restaurant during the shutdown and ordered a steak bowl,It was so blended and tasted like beans,What a disgrace to use overnight ingredients during this crisis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Manager was very understanding and accommodating when we called almost at closing (emergency need for takeout) staff making food was prompt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was only girl making food,to make one of the workers food before my already 30 minute late,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this chipotle has topped the worst chipotle i have ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't mean to pile on but this chipotle does really suck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle in the Orl,I'm also writing this review about 5 months later because I went to a different chipotle that was way superior,If I was at the mall and craving chipotle,Do not go to this sad excuse of a chipotle,they always resort to charging you extra even if you ask for extra rice or salsas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The place is already packed out the door ALL OF THE TIME so let's allow line jumpers to order their food online,The online orders are never prepared on time and when the person comes to pick up their ginormous food order,they're out of forks and people are waiting for their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I like the fact that I can see how they are preparing the food, I love their food , They all went back touching /serving food,So if Chipotle is pitching good healthy food for you then why aren't they serving it in a SANITARY manner,I told her and she made me a new salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a lot of food gets spilled on the counter along the way ,The food here is simply not good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I want to hop back there and make my own damned bowl, Another one had a sign on there door one day saying they were out of lettuce and chips, Yesterday the guacamole was GREY, Another time they were out of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delicious food at a great,I always get the burrito bowl,The tacos are small,price,My favorite meat is with the pork,but delicious,It's fresh and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no salsa,no sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So my visit and my food were really great,I went by myself and ordered a bowl with double, chicken,That's why I always get the double chicken,I definitely always get their chips,I like to take it home and put 1/2 of it over a bed of lettuce ,It has a bit of a sweet taste to it but it really enhances the taste of all of the ingredients,They have a kind of salty lime taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place USED to be meticulously clean with a line of customers waiting to order their food,presentation of food containers was unsanitary,(containers had dried food smeared on the sides & edges),With all that being said I will add that burrito was good,& my friend's salad was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have asked for my food twice ,my food still didn't get made,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was only one person in line and it still took about 15 mins for me to get my food, Don't give me even close to the amount of chicken they are supposed to put in the taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 There was not much meat ,The quality at this location has really declined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a steak burrito bowl to go,and discovered that the steak was at room temperature ,Then I found a disgusting little bug on a piece of romaine lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With so many other option in the neighborhood I do t know why anyone would get food here,They burn the meats ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never had such large pieces of green peppers in my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food on tables& floor ,food didn't look at temp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Moral of the review is that chipotle is a hit or miss and hopefully you don't come across someone who hates their job making burritos all day,Seems a little silly to write a negative review for chipotle just because there's usually part time high,delicious bowl,a quesadilla and chicken bowl,She was throwing around my bowl spilling tons of lettuce all over the place,Then she threw my boyfriends quesadilla into the press very angrily and shut the lid down on it completely smashing it flat where all the cheese spilled out of the tortilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great service and outstanding food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the first time was when I asked for double steak and the employee just start picking the chicken out of the bowl in front of me like are you serious,Then today I go back and ask for double steak one of the employees kept yelling she didn't have back up so she just put the regular,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after getting my food,I open my burrito to find what I can only describe as what appeared to be a one h,anded deaf child's attempt at rolling a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pleasantries or fresh food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The 2 carnitas burritos were enjoyed,But my bowl was just awful,I built my own bowl,It was pretty much wilted lettuce in a pool of salsa,The chips were wicked salty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the same two women who work the counter at the time make little effort to make the food in any way that makes sense,I am extremely disappointed by the customer service that I received by the staff at this chipotle,I hope the chipotle management will fix this issue ,When rice or a topping is low,they will instead give a half scoop of rice or salsa so that you clearly do not get a proper,Even when the chefs in the back are clearly getting more rice or meat ready,and it frankly frustrates me that I still pay full price for what I order despite only getting half of what I should have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've entered a chipotle once before,We tried a rice bowl,The cilantro lime white rice was good,I wish you could take the rice ,You have to buy chips separately,and corn from Chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a steak burrito ,The staff making the burrito was completely rude,""" and when I said burrito the guy has to open a new",That's how I feel about this chipotle,and toward the last few bites the meat chewed weird so I opened it up ,and poured it out only to see the meat completely under cooked,I'm honestly scared to get on my 6 hour flight and being sick after the other reviews and my own bad experience with undercooked meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Today I opted for a burrito,I was thrilled to get my burrito nearly 5 min after I ordered," I def ordered ""light beans"" ""light rice"" so I wouldn't have to deal with a gargantuan burrito ",Lol while I certainly appreciate this monster burrito (bang for your buck) ,Lifesaver- my burrito was yummmmyyyy,Quick to stop in for a bite of rice,beans , I usually get salads so I can get my plethora of lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cheese wasn't even melted in my quesadilla ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a bowl,Come back to finish the bowl with my daughter a little,I'm not sure how it would ever be difficult to not put meat in a meatless bowl ,I start to eat and find a piece of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They always make a mess of my bowl ,Your bowl should not collapse from from moisture,and do not understand 'double' as in double black [beans],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Being reasonable I start walking out to put in my order until he starts telling me if I pay with cash he'll go make me my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the SLOWEST GROUP ever - I don't think I've ever waited 45 minutes for a soggy burrito bowl before,The cheese is always frozen,and the four pieces of lettuce I get in my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She touched sour cream (on someone's food) with *,"
guacamole* SPOON & then ",e.cheese,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Busiest chain burrito place I've eaten at, The burritos here are huge, Pretty simple menu with all the standard choices of meats ,and ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's tragic food ,while I requested extra rice ,25 covers lunch and dinner - decent price point for healthy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I appreciate all of you so much for not judging me asking for 3 sides of sour cream and my bowl is always perfec,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had asked my friend if they were sick as well from the food ,I always go to the chipotle on millenia ,my stomach was hurting really bad and I know it was from this chipotle cuz it was the last,I don't recommend this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(I understand saving food costs,"Once I was able to order I was asked ""White rice or brown",rice,except the brown rice was empty,so there was never brown rice to offer,The employee on the line hadn't even started making the white rice,"""Chicken bowl"" and stated the price ","""Chicken bowl"" ",In the end the bowl was lukewarm,The chicken,salsas,I let him know I was hoping to purchase a drink and chips,Then he got the drinks and chips, and over 1/2 of the chips were inedible,and guacamole were stingily doled out,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered food at 7 something came ,8:40 no food,The food should have been here a8:20 so I did not get food,They blame chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered my food for pickup at 7:30 ,and 30 minutes later still no food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really enjoy Chipotle for the price an quantity of food,I went to Noodles & Co next door and had amazing service good food for the same,So it would have been 40min for me to get a burrito bowl,price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited 45 minutes for my burrito outside the store only to be told my order had been deleted,:( I still got charged for the burrito because I paid through the app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my food via the app so I could swing by ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We always eat at this chipotle,A couple women had him make a bowl,and then on the second bowl they said they want it the exact,""" He couldn't just look at the last bowl for five seconds ",Our bowls were skimpy,The medium salsa she doused my bowl with was all liquid,making my whole bowl runny ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Lately the prices have gone up ,and the service and quality have dropped significantly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Great food ,This chipotle is the best, One time the steak was not ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 If you're in a pinch and just need some food,saw who was putting the burritos together, One out of five burritos seems to be put together OK, Some burrito builders skimp so much on the fillings that you'd think it was coming out of their paycheck, The other 4 out of 5 are just slopped together with the juices for the beans ,and meats running out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,The staff is friendly and will patiently explain if you are not sure of the process of ordering or what the food is,I always get the bowl as I find it less messy to eat compared to a burrito,My favorite is the barbacoa where the meat is so soft,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle ,They give chipotle a bad,They never have all the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is so fresh,I go to chipotle in Woburn at LEAST once a week,It's priced well,the chicken ,and tastes amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food, The employees making our burrito bowl look like they were miserable,  When I got back to my desk at work the guacamole was already brown on my burrito bowl, I had 70% rice while the black," They slipped the bowl together like it was a ""Prison line"" (as seen in tv)", It was the worst bowl I ever tasted,chicken chewy , beans ,and the chips were very stale, The lettuce was wilted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location I always get the nicest people at and I have fallen in love with their burrito bowls - holy cow they pack it crazy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It does speak to the quality of food i,burritos are MASSIVE, Bring your hunger if you want a burrito, The bowls however seem less overwhelming, I stick with the chicken , The choices of salsas,My friends and i sometimes get a bag of ships and some salsa , The chips are usually fresh, I like tortilla chips more than potato, I like the selections here for meats, The guacamole is a great,the steak is sometimes tough,similar to the salad offerings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As far as food goes, If you go around lunch time the food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not a table top that didn't have food smeared on it,Even the front door was smeared with food ,But FAR more serious was the condition of the kitchen food preparation areas,old food scraps covering the surfaces everywhere,Every surface area was covered with old food,The food line where you order your item,We watched as blindly oblivious staff dragged paper food bowls through this filth like a pig's dinner,It was like one giant food toilet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love chipotle ,I have worked in fast food and quick service and astonished at how inconsistent you guys are compared to other chipotles,This made for a unpleasant visit because each one of the new workers were super new and measuring each scoop of rice ,beans ,or meat they gave me to the tea,) Then they gave me a half scoop of guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quality and taste of food to be consistent,Not a fan of chains but I prefer Chipotle burritos over other,My favorite is the chicken burrito ,It definitely fills me up and I think it's a reasonable price (under $10 with guacamole),Always get the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which I've never seen at any chipotle ever,Huge scoop of chicken,I love that it's nestled in the corner of a shooping center,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get it great food on the go ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70 tofu burrito,sticky pop on the counters and other tidbits of taco debris all over the tables ,95 for 2 tablespoons of guacamole on the already overpriced $6,the chips are one of my favorite, Food tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I will always choose Chipotle over any other fast ""food"" joint",I dig the rice bowl--cilantro-lime,brown rice,pulled pork or chicken,black beans, and corn salsa,like non-GMO meats ,and antibiotic free meats,cheese,sour cream,I support this place because they use quality ingredients,I eat here because it tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I guess I should have known that it was a mistake to order anything other than a burrito here at Chipotle,I've heard talk of lines out the door and around the block for Chipotle burritos,But I was a dummy and ordered a taco salad,there was no taco shell,I guess I have my own idea of what a taco salad should be,I'm thinking Border Cafe taco salad,"It was a ""salad bowl",they loaded a very oniony salsa on top without even asking,and though I like fresh salsa,fresh tortilla chips,The short story is that there was no way to avoid all of those spicy purple onions and their taste overpowered the taste of the rubbery spicy beef,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is a lot of food for a kid,And of course the food was tasty,It comes with a 8 inch cheese quesadilla with a choice of rice ,and beans with a serving of fruit or kids chips ,I choose apple juice and added the meat for only 0,This is a review for the kids meal cheese quesadilla ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know what a good burrito tastes like,There's a dearth of good burritos in Portl,fresh GMO-free burrito in Portl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All the ingredients are ridiculously delish - my fav is the rice- that you dont even need all the cheese,I have an abnormal obsession with their fajita bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my usual burrito bowl w/ half sofritas,but they really loaded my bowl up,half chicken,They were out of non-GMO chicken that day,I've found I usually have to ask for more of the item like beans & etc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came to get burritos tonight,Then I get home and the burritos are horrible,But I was starving so we just ordered (how is chipotle out of salsa ,I will not be eating at chipotle again,the chicken taste like it's been there for hours and the rice is hard,I should have walked out the door when they said they were out of sour cream and mild salsa,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The workers are skimpy scums when I say I want rice that means I want a lot of rice not one grain of it BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,I came to potle hoping to fulfill my happiness but instead I got like one piece of chicken in my chicken bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Definitely worth a stop by if you enjoy chipotle,Only small grip is that the chips were mildly stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've have been eating at the original Chipotle just down the street from DU (Denver University) since the mid 90's and have always loved their food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but rice was a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I thought it was one of the best burritos I'd ever eaten,and while the burrito was just as bit ,By the time you add guacamole ($1,and delicious as I remembered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I took my food to-go, For a carnitas burrito , The line always moves quick at chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was really good,The location looked clean and the food looked fresh,It was pretty noisy inside though and I had a repeat myself a couple times for my food selections as they couldn't hear me (granted I do have a softer voice),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Of course they'll ask you what do you want in your burrito,If you what a ready burrito go find a place on your own,and get already ready burrito - they sell them at the gas stations,The Chipotle burritos are big,while eating your delicious and giant burrito :) ,because I've never eaten such a great burritos,and thank you all for the delicious burritos you make for us,and taste great for the bargain price of $7,It is true that the guacamole is extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,Like today i ordered a bowl and they forgot my rice,he ordered white rice ,and ended up getting brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good food,but still good food for its price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went there a month ago & the food was gross,However after a friend was craving chipotle we went to this location even after I warned against it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Four stars for food , Love the Fritos vegetarian bowl so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
especially when it comes to added toppings in your burrito or salad,I will say that there has been a time that my burrito seemed a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At that point I decided to give up and left without food,I get it that chipotle is always busy,There was no brown rice or fajitas so they put my order aside to help other, they were out of both white and brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like the option of having both rice and brown rice for the burrito ,but it feels one gets less quantity when order the brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Broke the wrap in burrito ,Waited at least 15 minutes for chicken to cook,That's like going to KFC and you have a 20 minute wait for chicken plus waiting in line ,Over salted chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All the workers stop and it's like 7 people are working on putting sour cream on this one pre ordered taco,I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the quality of the food is always right on,but after seeing the food inc,Just knowing that the meats and produce are of such superior quality makes the food experience all the more enjoyable,rich flavors from the rice,beans,How many fast food places will do a segment about where they get their meats ,and meat together with the crisp ,and refreshing sauces and veggies to make a delicious combination of flavors explode in your mouth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food was ready, I drove back to work and laid out the food,or if that's too much hassle -- a compensation for the missing food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they really need to learn how to roll a burrito,Other burrito places do it much bette,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice staff and good quality fast food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stale chips and cold food,And why was my food cold,Do they not have heating under the hot food trays,I've been to better chipotles,If I'm paying extra for chips I don't want to bite into a chip that seems like its been left open,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even though it took over 20 minutes to get our disappointing food,I literally had less than half a full burrito bowl (normally it's full,there were 4 people working there standing around talking while one guy made burritos ,Then they didn't have any white rice made,who had gotten brown rice,almost raw rice,They were also running out of beans,and salsa,Most of the time this location is merely so-so (high fat:meat ratio ,all of their meat,brown guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I LOVE the *food,the food is excellent,dining area is nice and you just can't beat the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also didn't have hard tacos,no cilantro in white rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a burrito,I don't like this burrito at all,There was more than half of burrito left in my h,I felt $9 for this burrito was bit too much,NO refried beans,I'll have pinto beans,1) there's no refried beans,2) this white pinto beans had no flavour,4) why is there no mild option for salsa,3) steak is dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overhyped food ,Do yourself a favor and eat real Hispanic/Latin food,That weekly hankering for a burrito is completely underst,I would skip Chipotle and go to Moe's or an authentic burrito place instead,The only way you can add any flavor to your burrito/bowl is to add sour,"The ""cilantro"" rice tastes like water ",I already think that Chipotle is overpriced ,and the beans are about as flavorful, cream or salsa,The medium salsa is honestly the best thing they have in that restaurant,The corn salsa is pretty good,The meat options are good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The past 4 times I've been to this particular Chipotle they have made my chicken burrito extra, The lettuce is all over the place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I admit i was little afraid on eating at this place with the health scare but this place was good  we got the bowl and it was really good the staff was nice the only thing the tortillas were chewy  the inside of the restaurant was nice and the menu board was easy to read   and the prices are reasonable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He put the pen down and proceeded to touch my food,Once it was my turn I watched the gentlemen who would be making my burrito use a r,He sparingly added rice and chicken to my burrito to which I made a sour,He then yelled is there a problem with your burrito,I left unhappy and my burrito was super,I've never had a bad experience at a chipotle until visiting this location,I said it just appears to not have much meat or rice,He went on about it costing extra as he dumped 2 more pieces of chicken on it,andom pen and meat thermometer to jot down some stuff in a book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the burrito bowl,I like to get a bag of chips and scoop up my burrito bowl like a layered,I have never gotten a burrito,I have been to the Natick and Norwood locations and have found everything to be consistently good quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I come to this chipotle I leave in a better mood,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had to come back and give them an extra star because the steak tacos were finally on point ,and the chips were great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,This is the chipotle closest to me ,They have previously argued with me about of something was or was not in my bowl from ordering online ,They run out of beans ,This is the 4th time I've come and asked for chips ,and meats toward closing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I go into this chipotle it is literally at the very LEAST a 20 minute wait,I've never seen any other chipotle go this slow,Any other chipotle I go to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm a sucker for the giant burrito-zillas that I get Chipotle,:D Always ask for your burrito to be double-wrapped,It's all free with your burrito, with extra rice,beans,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also had no chicken cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I grabbed a bottle of tabasco chipotle sauce , I had the steak bowl with white rice,pinto beans,and a scoop of guacamole,cheese,fresh and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was also terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I still love the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typical chipotle food,a little on the greasy side for the chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We had to ask the next person in line to actually give us the food that we asked for ,The food was alright,Maybe if you're going to work in the food service industry you should try losing your hate for large,I asked for a fajita burrito bowl with chicken ,If you like a side of shame and discomfort with your burrito,and what I got was half of one scoop of rice that covered less than half the bottom, the bowl,about 2 mouth fulls of the wrong kind of beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When you go there make sure to try a half and half in a burrito bowl,Prices have gone up slightly ,fresh and delicious for their customers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thou my fellow chipotle lovers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If not for its 'organic' and hormone free meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A hearty portion of rice in the burrito bol makes me happy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and do not know how to fill their proportions in their tacos correctly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My boyfriend was kind enough to bring me and my friend a chicken bowl on his way back from Guildford mall,I'm seriously sensitive to spice so he ordered MILD salsa on both our bowls ,and they put Medium salsa on BOTH of them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you go to their website you can order your food ahead of time,Everything is very well spiced and they have 4 different salsas to choose from,The veggies are fresh and the meat is all humanely raised ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,the portions are huge and the prices are reasonable - but I generally find the food to be a little,I usually get the barbacoa or carnitas while my wife orders the vegetarian which simply omits the meat protein (you still get refried or black beans as a protein though),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I walk in and tell them to give me my food I paid for it ,I ordered at 11:15 got my food at 11:50 after arguing with idiots,He even told him it wasn't at the this chipotle,I ordered chicken and got steak with nothing I wanted on the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The proportions are always off and quality of food is bad,A couple of times they forgot the salad dressing with the salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really enjoy Chipotle's food,My burrito bowl, For a burrito bowl,2) Pricey, Although my little one will eat rice,she won't eat rice with green,chips & guacamole,3) I've never gotten a big of chips that were FRESH, They always taste a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I see everyone struggling especially with their food in their hand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had one of their burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always great food,Personally I like the bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was supposed to be a burrito ,but when I open it up there was no protein which was suppose to be a barbacoa burrito,So all I got was a veggie burrito bowl,but instead I got a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I order here for lunch all the time and usually have a good/fair experience and am satisfied with the food,I expressed frustration and another employee started making my food no questions asked,I ordered my bowl online as usual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get a chicken burrito,brown rice,black beans,corn salsa ,and hot salsa,cheese,and lettuce (in case you were wondering) :,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got the three barbacoa tacos,I did not like the extra cost for guacamole however,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It tasted like they used food right or of the coolers or something,arrived exactly on time and when I got my burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not the food itself,Chipotle by far makes the best burrito in the area, Make sure they add the corn salsa to the burrito- it really adds a subtly sweet, The cost is a little high (burrito with guac ,but guacamole costs more in this part of the country because we do not consume as much, flavor that complements the rest of the ingredients,socially responsible ingredients than the junk you get at Taco Bell,but I would rather have high quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No salsa bar for customers,lack liquid queso cheese as an option,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is about the same,but yet they're closed and not serving food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is NOT Mexican food,and is yet another reason to love Chipotle (although I personally ate at Chipotle and loved it before I cared about food sustainability),the beans and rice have a surprising,All of Chipotle's pork and chicken is organic,The salsas are actually spicy,The meat is tender ,as all of the other meats are far too spicy for me,and the guacamole is easily the best you'll ever find in a nationwide,but I still prefer Chipotle over Anna's because of the freshness and quality of the ingredients,Some (though unfortunately not all) of the other ingredients are also produced organically,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love authentic Mexican and chipotle is not authentic,I love chipotle ,but it doesn't taste good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is by far my favorite Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff are always friendly and very accommodating of food allergies ,I cannot have cheese and there was cheese that made it's way into the guacamole,they both hopped into gear and made an individual serving of guacamole for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had the chicken burrito with pinto,The burrito was huge,brown rice,Friends and I all agreed that chicken is the best,beans,mild salsa,Friends ordered the guacamole and chips,lettuce,and corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I found plastic wrapping in my food,The meats are not kept at the correct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was alright however the state of cleanliness was embarrassing,Every table was covered with trash and food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food itself was not as good,75 which I'd rather spend on more quality food,My friend was also disappointed with his steak burrito as everything tasted old,I know that I should be offered pinto or black beans in my salad,I assumed that she was going to ask about the beans after ,some staff members seemed to be uneducated about the basic ingredients served when one of them were about to restock the black beans,salsa,I honestly couldn't taste anything but the mild salsa,I didn't want to hold up the line so I went along with it and decided to opt for an extra side of guacamole ($2,but I was honestly pretty mad about the weak scoop of guacamole that I received,and guacamole that I was served,cheese,but the staff went from putting my lettuce in,Most components were bland from the lettuce,corn,I'm no stranger to the salad from Chipotle ,20 extra) to compensate my bean-less salad which ended up to be a bad,My salad ended up being $11,I honestly couldn't taste anything ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The guacamole on top was good,I ordered a veggie salad from here ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Horrible service employees have a don't care and unprofessional attitude  I would recommend going to a different chipotle it's worth the time to go outta the way to avoid the horrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the food destination,I lived off a stack of free burrito cards a friend had given me for several,I'd go in and buy a burrito ,My tastes have evolved a little since then (and once I regained the desire to eat burritos which,took a few years): now I get the veggie burrito bowl instead of half,I get brown rice instead of white,it's no longer than I'd wait in a regular store during lunchtime and the quality and freshness (that awesome lime-cilantro rice,So they put everything else I wanted in the bowl , carnitas/half chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome food,big burritos,or questionable Qdoba for burritos again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you order online make sure your food is made correctly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Id gladly drive to another location to enjoy delicious Chipotle food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos,cripsy tacos,I usually stick to the chicken with heaping portions of pinto,I definitely do not need any more heat by adding the salsa,and chips yum,Plus the chips just have that hint of lime in them,guacamole,sour cream and maybe some cheese or lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Or should i say burrito nazi,2 stars down for burrito nazi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love chipotle ,he was suck in  bad mood that he looked at me wrong when i asked him to serve me a little more beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do love how seasoned their food is ,I always order a chicken taco with veggies ,The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars is because I wish the tacos were hotter by the ti,This chipotle was packed ,I do love chipotle though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,Their burritos are massive, and the ingredients are very fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food taste good, An employee should always wash hands in between or before handling food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when I came to boston it is very hard to find mexican food which taste like chipolte,i am vegitarian so i know only about fujito burrito ,and burrito bo,bt one day i was searching chipotle in my area,I tried qdoba but i didnlt like much they have black beans ,but it is really without taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some might call my love for chipotle burritos an addiction,burritos everywhere else just don't taste as good,I L-O-V-E their rice (I always ask for extra,I tend to mix it up between steak and chicken,their corn salsa is a delightful,and the steak is so tender,and I was pleased when I discovered they are somehow both just as delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Serving food with no care,I have to picked out burn veggies and scraped from the dirty grill off my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the closest tasting food that reminds me of my Southern California roots here in Vancouver,I've been to both locations here and the food tastes the same,The employees are on a break sitting at the tables right across where they serve food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is what you would expect,Standard chipotle menu ,It's a quick and delicious meal option,and quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food ,I have been going to chipotle for over 14 years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is really good,high-quality fast-food Mexican,it's almost worth getting the chips just to get their hot salsa,which is the best hot salsa I've ever tasted,the chips, The chips are stale, And it would be one thing if they were free chips that came with your meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
especially with burrito ,and bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 No matter how good your food are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They even let us keep the old food,they can't resell the food,While mine was suppose to be a burrito,it ended up being a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Always tastes fresh with chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was great,There was a person with a food allergy in front of use who was being nicely accommodated with a separate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
little bit of brown rice,I get the same thing every time: salad bowl,half chicken/half pork (sometimes double chicken),red beans,hot salsa,guacamole ,the ingredients, taste fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband loves this place but the food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While the lines are generally long it is worth the wait once you take the first bite of your delicious burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Instead of getting the burrito the size of your arm,* Less guilt--I didn't scarf down an entire bag of the full-sized chips or eat a burrito the size of my arm by myself,I was able to order a single hard taco with small, sides of rice,black beans,and a perfectly petite order of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chairs were thick of food smears , I couldn't eat I threw my food away,I haven't been to this chipotle in a while,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BEST chipotle location ever,chicken ,and steak is well seasoned,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Want less sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,rice or chips I decided to give them their proper,but tonight after waiting 20 mins because of lazy employees just to find out that they have no chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tasty food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was excited to try this place but my chicken burrito tasted exactly the same,Watching the server's sloppy construction and resulting double wide burrito inspired a sense of déjà vu,When eating one of those monstrosities one must implement an entirely new game plan to ensure that the mound of rice perched precariously in the center doesn't come tumbling out along with that precious,The tortilla chips were tasty, guacamole,The server did give me an entire heaping spoonful of guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After my last visit to the Mickey D's of Mexican food,Maybe it depends on the person you end up getting in the food assembly line,I sat down to enjoy my carnitas burrito with all the fixins ,I couldn't help but notice their jumbo burritos,Their burritos were bigger than mine,I don't know what your name is burrito maker,steer clear of the chips,They didn't order extra meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito was good,I ordered chips along with my burrito ,but had to ask for salsa,When she gave me the small container of salsa I was shocked based on then number of chips in the bag,It is obvious it is not enough salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but nukes them out of the water on quality,and taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yet go to this location and I'm served 20 grains of rice ,and 3 pieces of chicken,FYI - the chicken doesn't come out of your paycheck & customers like myself will pay for double, meat if double,meat is given,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
none of the food was fresh/hot,my boyfriend realized the burrito was freezing cold,This is the closest chipotle to my house ,They skimp on the rice, and it was all down to the bottom of the bowl) the line had then extended toward the door,half a spoonful of chicken ,and four pieces of the shredded lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ask for something and its not *extra charge* like some of those other burrito chains,They don't screw you on price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As far as chipotles go,and they always load your bowl up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 This will be the best location to access the mall food court,Good old chipotle never goes wrong with the burrito bowl with lemon,Since this chipotle is inside the mall, cilantro white rice,black beans,medium hot salsa,cheese,and lettuce,roasted corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you're looking for over priced under quality food this is your spot,Overall a disappointing lack luster chipotle experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They need to be more organized with the amount of people who are getting food,  All that accomplishes is cold food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered 6 bowls,"one had extra spicy 
salsa",one didn't have any sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was still awesome,and I like to support the community-based burrito shops,but Chipotle simply has the best burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,the staff really stepped up gor a woman with a food allergy,had him scrub his hands and re-glove and pull special food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Meanwhile the cooks behind the 2nd counter were having a mini food fight,They were throwing food at each other,Due to the incompetent cooks who were too occupied with throwing food at each other,The heath inspector would've died yesterday if they saw the way the workers treated the food/restaurant,I asked the girl to add lettuce and corn salsa on the side of my tacos she told me no ,I could only imagine the dissatisfaction that would come with biting into a taco full,I realized my corn salsa was COMPLETELY frozen,There were no chips cooked or ready,but Joshua told me two mins until there were fresh chips,I waited 15mins until Joshua had to step in the back and get the chips himself, of frozen corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered soft shell tacos with barbacoa,they literally put about a tablespoon of meat in the taco,My wife ordered soft shell tacos as well,the girl preparing my tacos literally stopped in the middle of finishing my order,This location is in the mall and by far the worst experience I have ever had at a chipotle,one with chicken, one barbacoa and they all lacked in the meat portion area,even the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is not as fresh, I ordered my burrito for here , The cashier literally rolled my burrito across the metal countertop towards me, I watched as the man behind the counter put one spoonful of rice in my burrito ,and burrito wrappers on other, There were also burrito toppings all over the tables,I am firm believer that if you don't order beans they should give you extra rice, Then the lady behind me ordered a bowl with beans and received 2 1/2 spoonfuls of rice,bowl, The chicken was cold,and I asked for more since I wasn't getting beans , I am absolutely nuts about their hot salsa, There is something truly glorious about the mixture of the hot salsa ,and sour cream, I had to search hard for a clean table and eventually found one tucked in the corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it makes me happy to find a place that's a) a ton of food,MAJOR MAJOR props for having all natural meat,I'd love to be able to substitute the guacamole, Especially in my case since I can't have the sour cream or cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
knows the price for the amount and quality of food can't be beat,I get enough food for two good,Eating good quality food on a budget can be challenging,so I make a little burrito the first,rice,salsas,You want all 4 salsa, go round then usually scoop it up with chips for my second,The quality of all their meats,cheese,skip the sour cream and cheese ,and sour cream are superb,skip the sour cream ,I always get a salad with a tortilla on the side (which they don't charge for),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I generally like the food at Chipotle for a border/Tex-Mex, They overstuff their burritos,so I usually tell them to give me 1/2 the amount of meat that they normally give in a burrito, I sometimes find their chicken to be a bit wobbly, Their chips aren't all that great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They try to rush you through the line and hardly give you any rice or meat,Friday evening I went to get a bowl ,There have been times I say double meat and they hardly put anything in the bowl,You can get more meat ,but they try to charge you for double when in fact the double meat should have been what you get in the first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went in for lunch today and got a burrito with guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I love the food at Chipotle to begin with (all you ""it's not authentic",even if I always manage to make myself sick by failing to take half my burrito home,prices are reasonable,I've never suffered any crunchy rice or stiff, beans or dry, meat,ingredients are natural,and it's *delicious*),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd rather go to whole foods ,and get a burrito they don't stuff it to the brim,My burrito immediately fell apart ,don't know why everyone loves chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never had a bad burrito here,The ingredients are natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The tomato salsa tastes like straight tomatoes,The corn salsa was was over cooked, I  ordered the chips ,and guacamole and the bag of chips was almost empty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On the plus side the food has always been good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The kid obviously hadn't been trained well and literally put half a pound of cheese on my burrito,A couple incidental letdowns: the side of queso I ordered was cold and the chips had an absurdly high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle in the country h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is one of the fasted,moving chipotles I have ever been to,chipotle always tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So this is the closest chipotle to my job,They barely put any chicken in my bowl,When I asked for a little bit of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But I had to balance that with the food,We stopped here and split a burrito with chips ,After having our burrito we both tried to figure out why we didn't like it in the past,The deal was a free burrito ,And a cheap one too since a burrito is so big,In fact the first time I tried it I was not impressed and thought the rice was dry,and salsa,I was also a big fan of their chips and salsa,And the green salsa is amazing,I was also a big fan of their chips ,The chips had the right,as it was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the freshness of the food at Chipotle,Try the salad to save on carbs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We got the burrito bowl with half chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I felt like I had to justify my choice to her before she would put it on my burrito,and the server knew *exactly* how to wrap a perfect burrito,So I went to this Chipotle yesterday to satisfy a craving for creamy beans,The refried beans,"The server also seemed shocked when I asked for ""hot"" salsa",The really really hot salsa,Chipotle only gets 3 stars from me because the meat (beef) was soooo incredible,The real sour cream,The corn,but failed to listen to me and my friend as we both asked *very specifically* for small portions of certain ingredients,I love anything and everything that is rolled in a tortilla and smothered in delicious firey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is fresh,but I tried it again based on the merit of the food , The burritos are gigantic,and the hot salsa is one of the best hot,salsas I've ever tasted, The chips have a great, and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Usually it's that they make the food too early,and the food just sits there until you pick up,I'm here to pick up my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was tasty,I got the sofritas bowl ,The only difference was the corn salsa (one small scoop) - I had more of nearly every topping and the bowls were made by the same,and he got a mix - half chicken ,and steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  Simply asked another question for lettuce ,we ran out of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I feel that you can't beat the price for this amount of quality food,The burrito bowl is my new, It's a burrito without the tortilla ,burrito bowl,brown rice,and in a bowl,I requested the bowl with everything - sour,and salsa,The chips are fantastic,warm chips & guac, I've gotten it many times with meat,guacamole,lettuce,popping it in the micro obviously also warms the lettuce,corn,the service and quality at this particular,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can't go wrong at chipotle,I wish the guac wasn't so pricey on top of the high,price you already pay though cause it sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hot and delicious food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This time around the burrito bowl,It could be the mild salsa we got with it,had a strange taste to it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food is as fresh,as fast Mexican food can be ,In any case I ordinarily would have given 4 stars because their chips are always just a tad, However with those petty 1 star reviews it just didn't seem fair to dock them a star for chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If they could just give a little more in their portions and keep their food consistently flavorful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They had 3 people helping with food so understaffing,How did I order a burrito ,and end up with a rice bowl,I also asked for a sprinkle of cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It was my first time as a Chipotle chain restaurant and I thought the food was decent,My coworkers are big fans of this restaurant as it was a close place that allowed them to get a large amount of good food at decent,prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For a quick huge burrito this is the place for you,I love the chicken burrito with both beans,sour cream and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I barbacoa burrito last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And being that asked for double chicken and guac on my burrito bowl,This restaurant (like every chipotle in Portl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They ran out of food,Several of us walked out without food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle ,There was a pretty long line but I was craving chipotle before going to class so I decided to wait in the line,I also had a free chips ,When I arrive to my destination I look inside my bag and to my surprise there were chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" While it isn't the absolute ""best in town"" for mexican food", I definitely recommend it if you need a mexican food fix ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food plain ,It is pricey for fast,I get one scoop of brown rice ,It does cost $2 for a scoop of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Skimpy portions and quality of food is low,I am a chipotle lover ,but it really varies from location to location in terms of quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As far as the food goes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Decent price,and muy favorite are the bowls,the guacamole and chips and salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and and leave the slices of beef and chicken at room temperature for a few,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a bowl and hubby got a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they seem to always mess up on their food,Today my fiancé wanted chipotle ,I got chicken quesadilla ,and the cheese was not melted,Last time I got a salad and it was old lettuce that was almost getting brown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They service was good and the food was excellent,The only thing that wasn't appreciated was the shortage pinto beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito is overprice for the size,The servers don't know how the burrito is served,My burrito was EXTREMELY COLD,I have never ate in my life COLD tacos or quesadillas neither burritos,The rice ,and beans were literally frozen,You have to pay extra for the guacamole so be careful,this makes the flavor to have an awful taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went there friday night about 8:00 and the place was a mess every table had left over food on them ,The chicken in the burrito I oredered was under cooked ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bowl I got,I thought all chain stores like this made it a goal to taste the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are always great,The burrito prices are high,The rice ,and bean bowls are good prices at $2,and they use the freshest ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
soggy stale chips,brown guacamole (3 times a row,spoiled lettuce,out of ingredients,However it has been clear after our last 3 disappointing visits to this Dedham location that service and quality there is on a steady,Better to deal with parking than poor quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's definitely not ""authentic"" Mexican food ",(Boston really doesn't harness their Mexican food community though they are getting better,"Chipotle is sort of it's own ""type"" of food",I usually get the chicken burrito ,and much better than all the burrito shops that have sprung up in this town,"""Just gimme the burrito guy",Just the chips & guac alone are AMAZING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Too bad the food wasn't,I have been wanting to try Chipotle because I love burritos , The burrito was the shape of a cheese, The rice was bland,the hyped guacamole was brown , The steak was bland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food joint,It's convenient to my work and the food isn't bad,I much rather have a REAL burrito or REAL nachos from an authentic,it's just melted cheese on a soft taco folded in half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I never order anything spicy but my burrito was spicy, The only thing I can think of it had too much pepper and/or cilantro in the mild salsa , I ordered the carnitas and chips to go,and the chips were very salty,it looked like some meat was overcooked while some was undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This has become a food group all my itself at our house,Love the burrito bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But when I shop at derby at I come in for a burrito at chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All of your food is presented in front of you,Have as much as you want for one flat price,Wonderful taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We said no and he went to tell us all about the food there,Chicago has a lot of little burrito joints,)  Since good burritos aren't nearly as abundant,50 for a burrito,They have the sort of assembly-line of burrito production that Anna's ,The meat was the best I can imagine from a burrito joint,the best burrito in the world,you can get three tacos ,or three tacos,you can indeed get an individual taco,It wasn't very busy so I decided to take my time picking out what I wanted for my three tacos , And even though things are priced around $5,bowl, I wish I tried the chicken as well,Hence the free-range meat ,The steak was very flavorful,And the cheese was shredded as opposed to the slice you get at Boca Gr, The ingredients were fresh,and fresh ingredients, It definitely tasted fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food doesn't seem as flavorful,I love chipotle,I'd recommend going to the chipotle on Alafaya if you can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
carnitas and the actual bowls for the burrito bowl,I often eat chipotle ,All together a solid reason for me to never go to this chipotle again,Black and pinto beans,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it seems to be lacking the something special of Mexican food,fattening fast-food like BK or McDonald's,The burritos are ginormous,The prices,I have had a chicken ,and vegetarian one (the chicken was better),although I agree with the black beans being a bit too sweet,The ingredients they use are definitely fresh,Although the ingredients are very fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle may be my new favorite place for fast-food burritos,Their food's also pretty consistently good,Service:  Prompt fast-food service, A bit pricey for fast-food,consistent fast-food burritos,Chipotle's steak burrito is very tasty,They allow you to specify the ingredients going into your burrito,consistent steak burritos, Their lime rice goes very well with the meat,and their pico de gallo and hot salsa are welcome, Their Guacamole is also a special treat when accompanied by their chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If the dining area is so filthy wonder how dirty the kitchen and food prep areas are,food bits,The entire area around trash cans was dirty with slimy globs of food too,The food is okay,The burritos are overfilled ,I had to clean rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can't eat their tacos bc they refuse to let beans drain before slapping them on like a fucking,I have chipotle three times in my life,Whatever deal you made with the devil chipotle I can only hope he revokes it,The biggest of all why are the chips at every location stale af,My guess is you always get yesterday's chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food ,However they skimped out on my burrito bowl,I got half portions for my rice ,and beans,Chipotle is already expensive I didn't get what I paid for and the chips were very stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  If you go in and order it's better than getting it online because you know what ingredients went in your bowl or burrito,Our chipotle near is is pretty,consistent with quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the order was finally ready and after the 5 minute drive home we were treated to luke-warm to cold food for 4 of the 6 meals we ordered,the food should have been ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is definitely the best of the burrito chain restaurants that there are,They have really good carnitas and barbacoa fajita burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
00 price tag for and empty bowl that you could re-use to store your fruit in when you've finished off that one over-flowing fork full of food,2 strings of watery carnitas and maybe 14 pieces of white rice then this is the place for you,2 black beans,If you like being fed 3 pieces of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a chicken burrito at this location around 8 PM on 8/7/16 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got hime food was now cold,Only thing I can say is dont over cook the steak ot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice ,salsa,I ordered a steak salad to go,I got home and realized there was no steak,and about half of a cup of sour cream,Just lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food sucks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Continuously running out of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
two employees goofed off the whole time while one girl had to make everybody's food by herself,This caused the line to back up and for it to take 20 minutes to get my food, First they were out of the corn salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you dress in costume on Halloween you get half off your burrito,brown rice,The price has gone up over the years ,Burrito bowl,cheese & a bag of chips to eat my bowl with,chicken,no beans (ick,mild salsa,sour cream,lettuce,but it's still delicious so I keep coming back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are good,I like my burrito with chips,but I might as well go to a real restaurant for the same price,salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 BUT food is yummy,I often try to order something for my kids and a burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 a chipotle review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both of us where up all night sick because we got food poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I hate to say it and to tear down a beloved Chiptole but they have consistently overcooked the meat,and nothing they produce has the typical flavor and quality of Chiptole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 This time I ordered a burrito bowl with Barbacoa because they were out of Sofritas , I also got a side order of guacamole and chips,rock hard peppercorns mixed in with the meat that blended in well with the color of the meat,I usually love their guacamole but it wasn't very good this time and it had a big chunk of meat in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a double steak burrito ,Normally I don't go to chipotle because it is too spicy,It was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(Another reviewer claims that this particular location had bad food-h,i swear the burritos are getting smaller over time,it's a decent burrito,but when you need that burrito fix,Overpriced,Their vegetarian beans really are vegetarian,and they clearly label that the black beans are vegetarian,Their 'hot' salsa is even a little,Maybe their meat is really good,ever gotten the gastrointestinal unhappiness i call 'meat surprise for the vegetarian,and meat juices may well travel into a vegetarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's never taken us longer than about 10 minutes in line to get our food,Nothing better than chipotle's fresh,I always choose the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I made an account just to review this chipotle,and the girl working at that end took off the cover of the bowl ,I ordered a barbacoa bowl,and I had forgotten to put lettuce in,and all the ingredients were fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ordered my salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chips ,this is such a great option to eat healthy without losing the taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm normally a very big burrito fan,but when I went to bite into the burrito, The chicken still had some bone in it & overall,my tastebuds were not assaulted with flavor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great, They seem to have cut back on rice and meat for the burrito bowls at this location also, I found the burrito bowl I got to be very good, but the amount of rice ,and meat needs to increase for the amount they are charging,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know it's not authentic Mexican food,I recently tried the sofritas bowl ," If I'm feeling ""meaty"" I always get the barbacoa",So delicious,when we want something delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As for food,And not to forget the rice,I ordered the steak bowl ,I couldn't finish the bowl ,The steak was well seasoned ,and the corn was good,The girl behind the counter was talking to the customer in front of me about their salad dressing,and expressed how delicious it was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kids hated the rice ,and beans anyway,Bland and flavorless and they wouldn't let me have any salad for the kids meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I felt like this helped me build esprit de corps with the employee handling my food , The same burrito technician,chipotles to get to this specific, I just had the best bowl of my Chipotle career, The bowl also had the perfect,my final fork full still had chicken,pinto beans,vegetables and medium salsa in it,corn, ratio of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For a chain burrito,I might be more inclined to Qdoba but nothing beats an authentic spot like Tacos Lupita in Haverhill or a taco truck in Boston,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hello yummie burrito bowl,Please add some delicious lime cilantro rice with some amazing,Drop some corn lettuce and pinto beans in it,cover it with RED RED HOT SAUCE and some fresh mild tomato salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not even close to authentic Mexican food,I ordered 3 beef tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
considering you could drive 10 minutes to East Boston and get the same stuff for half the price at a family owned place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Great service and delicious food plus I like their whole,"""food with integrity"" thing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 However I do not love their burritos,which I love in a burrito,~The burrito was not made tightly enough so it was nearly impossible,My veggie big burrito ,~ The black beans were not so good,~The offer 3 kinds of salsa,~They have a few different kinds of meat to pick from,~ The cheese they add is cold,shredded cheese at the end with the quac,Cold cheese,~They offer corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The person who rang me up was courteous with the transaction and thoughtfully offered me a tray to carry my food,though the food preparer/order taker did ignore him ,and did not care for the food then,one for a free burrito,et al and another for free chips and salsa with purchase of a burrito, Husband used the free burrito coupon for a bowl ,Husband's burrito bowl was more generous,nothing like the one she fixed for a person ahead of me who also ordered no rice, That may have been because when the girl asked me what kind of rice I wanted I said none,she said brown and I was a bit brusque when I stopped her from filling my dish with brown rice,bowl,bowl or et al,and I got a bowl ,My bowl was a bit sparse, He found his bowl quite filling, The seasoning on the chicken did not work for me,My chicken,and beans were cold,and I got a  and used the chips and salsa coupon,The stale chips surprised, and the runny sour cream made for an unpleasant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Way too many people behind the counter touching my burrito, Despite half an army assembling my burrito,Adds up to a $9 burrito,Trying to hard on the rice,What's wrong with the beans,None of the salsa are any good,Just tastes, Also don't taste right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a large amount of food for around 600 calories,I'd make the rice at home if I could find a comparable,I choose the bowl , This is my bowl:,-Black Beans (I ask for a little more beans , The smile is usually returned and they throw on some more lettuce because they thi,and skip the onions/pepper blend and corn relish),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always get my food to go ,My fav chipotle from hingham to Boston,The Rajiv twins are the best chipotle workers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They give you TONS of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get uncooked slightly hard rice,NO LIE) Bowl and vary the meat type,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Undercooked food or very over cooked there is no happy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even though it's usually always the busiest in this food court,It's because it's delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I'm definitely a fan when I'm in the mood for a burrito,high quality ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ladies here are very helpfull and very fast friendly and polite it was my first time here and it was short of amazing the food the service ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is not authentic Mexican food by any means ,You go in and decide if you want a burrito,tacos or a bowl,your rice,white rice,I personally love the combo of chicken,your beans,pinto beans,your salsa,I have them put the guac and the med salsa on the side,you choose your meat,oh if I could write an ode to the guacamole I would,your toppings such as cheese,cheese,sour cream,sour cream , and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always great, The animals that will become your burrito are free, If you are an animal welfare type person or like quality meat this is your place for fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really enjoy ordering the bowl option instead of the burrito,The salsa is awesome,It offers you more ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most other locations clearly have a manager present at all times to ensure food is warm,Service is slow and burrito sizes are inconsistent,but they skimp on fillings and ingredients seem to be served cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I recommend Chipotle to anyone who prefers fast (but not that fast) food,The first time I heard of this joint was when they passed out coupons at work for free burritos,I like burritos ,burrito,in which whoever finishes the burrito in the fewest bites wins,The burrito was amazingly good,Also the veggie burrito comes with the guac free,rice,For this one I tried chicken ,black beans,then I asked for the corn salsa,I ordered the Ice Tea along with it and chips and salsa,then I was asked to select the meat,cheese,and sour cream,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle , The chips are way too salty,It is the type of meat used,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or the staff will somehow think you ordered 3 burritos ,00 dollars for a wrap that has rice,it may justify the price,and chicken in it,beans,Don't order anything with steak in it,because the steak is not exactly chewable,If it tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food court has more options ,The guy doling out the rice and beans was sticking to the one small scoop for beans and rice and I felt like their portions were much smaller than the happy to fill your burrito/bowl,The burrito wasnt that bad, Didn't notice until i got home to eat it and by then someone else got to eat my delicious burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One burrito is good,it starts to unravel and you end up with burrito guts all over the place,I also love getting the bowls (great,for no carb people) PLUS the bowl is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the quality & flavor of the food is consistent,In general Chipotle's price is $$,Both of these stores are consistent with the quality found in the California locations,or completely tasteless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20 minutes to close and there was no food,The manager needs to teach his employees how to keep the food stocked ttill clos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I rarely go here because of this but when I do i enjoy the food until it comes back to haunt me later,This is just my yummy quick food spot,As soon as I get there I know exactly what my taste buds scream out for and thats the burrito bowel,A couple of hours later I tend to feel pretty sick after my chipotle visits,A perfect size for me bowl filled with rice,Its like a party in my mouth every bite and when I finish I am left with an empty bowl I would love to refill ,beans,guacamole,steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
filthy floors with food everywhere(I would like to think that this surely does not represent Chipotle restaurants everywhere,placed our order and sat down for our food - it was pretty satisfying,nothing extravagant - just our burrito ,and all in all a good-enough meal for a reasonable price,and bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the food was as expected,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The next girl in line finishes off my burrito ,and my burrito ,I get rice ,and beans on the side,then I asked for steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent healthy food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is not that great, Moe's or tijuana flats has better service and better food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of my favorites is the fajita burrito bowl,It's less messy as their burrito (which is phenomenal,opt for the mild salsa,Don't forget the chips ,and guacamole (,Everything tastes so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just got a burrito from this location,the burrito isn't completely wrapped (is it even a burrito at that point,and it's more of a burrito ball than a traditional,burrito-- why can't they just spread out the ingredients so it doesn't come out to a burrito ball,Please apply this feedback while making burritos in the future,but the ingredients were not mixed,shape) by spreading the ingredients out more horizontally,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got the steak burrito,The ingredients seemed fresh but when it came to the construction of the burrito it leaked all over the place ,and the burrito just fell apart,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That can be overly overlooked if upon entering you are greeted by friendly staff and given great food,The young man who rung my order up was trying to ask me about chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's nothing worse than driving 15 min because you want some chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll say the food it taste just like any other, chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gross food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on an optimistic note at least the chicken wasn't pink in the inside this time,eating a salad without salad,Why serve salad ,but run out of salad dressing at 12:15 in the afternoon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and Mexican food,considering the food is pretty good,As a regular visitor you start to notice yourself and all of your friends avoid the burrito wraps ,and lean more towards burrito bowls,I ordered the chicken burrito bowl,brown rice,Prices are a little, Main point I think if prices were little,as the bowl seems to give you more bang for your buck ,with black beans ,I guess the trend of consuming fresh ingredients in a fast food setting justifies why they charge extra for ingredients such as guacamole,skip the cheese ,and sour cream,and lots of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as the service and food quality is consistent,Thanks for keeping me on my Chipotle chicken burrito bowl addiction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No veggies for my veggie bowl ,My boyfriend got the chicken ,and the lettuce looked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best and easy access to healthy food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
+ Tasty burrito (I'm not a fan of burritos ,- Veggie burrito should be cheaper,Price               $,although I order meat ones only ,+ Delicious guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I keep hoping this chipotle will redeem itself for previous,So they poured my sour cream in a chipotle bowl,It turned my rice into mush,"The most dissapointing part was that I said "" On the side: lettuce"" and the guy completely ignored me and put it on my bowl",I ask for it on the side because I normally don't finish my bowl ,Instead of giving me beans,and I don't like re heating lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chipotle isn't ""real"" Mexican food",you don't know good food, And I was eating the best freakin' burrito in the world,free range chicken, When I left Denver they had just introduced the free range pork and said they'd be working with suppliers to get chicken next, Even though I don't eat meat I appreciate the fact that they use anti-hormone, Freshest of fresh ingredients,I ate at the very first Chipotle in Denver and I'm happy to report that the quality of the chain in Denver has been transferred to the first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I continue to order my food ahead ,I use to work in Derby st and would always order chipotle ahead of time on the app,So disappointing to drive to Braintree for my chipotle since Hingham is 2 minutes from me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best food in the food court by far,I like my bowl a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went to Chipotle because their rewards system is ending soon and I wanted to claim my free chips ,Loren used a coupon code for me so I could get free chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Before I could say ""burrito",which they did but it took another 10 minutes of waiting before I received my burrito,I observed an employee slam the container of chicken down ,and watched juice from the chicken splatter everywhere - into the beans,I asked if they could get more sofritas and beans from the back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The people making the burritos were a bit slower than usual,At least it still tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This particular Chipotle has really bad service and low quality prep on their food,I've been to dozens of Chipotles and on the whole they're fast and have fresh ingredients in their food line,On top of that the food in the bins always looks like it's seen better days,the chips are stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Definitely a spot to eat at when in Orlando and craving chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you get what is expected at chipotle ,its not bad as you get to customize to your preference and its a large portion for a low price,brown rice,I got their salad (which is essentially a bowl with more lettuce) ,The cheese and sour cream i will definitely hold off on next time as it made the entire bowl really heavy,and added chicken,The chicken is flavourful,both beans, and not too fatty while the beans make it a really filling,corn salsa,medium salsa,sour cream and cheese topped with even more lettuce,The end result was really a large concoction of all the ingredients mashed together ,it looks kind of gross but the taste was all there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was once a time the burrito was so full,I love chipotle,I got half a spoon of rice ,I ended up with a bowl that was half full,It was well below the end of the bottom bowl,and corn salsa ,and about 5 shreds of cheese ,and not many more than that shreds of lettuce, because they ran out of ingredients so they just scrapped the pans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super tasty and convenient Mexican food,The Taco chicken salad had everything in it ,and the chicken on its own,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the quality of food , It is not the street-food style of Mexican,nor is it at all the TacoBell style of 'TexMex' food,but not as authentic as street-food or home style Mexican, It is not the greasy comfort food that most people are used to or maybe expecting, If you don't like line ups for your quick Mexican food,the food is low, I'm just glad that now we have a way tastier alternative to bland Subway for quick health food,and the prices are much, One time they just recognized us from being in there a few times before and they just gave us free chips ,they ran out of corn tortillas (my favourite) and just for that they gave us free chips ,and guacamole for no reason,and guacamole,and the healthier but tasty ingredients, quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,I came in today and ordered a bowl ,and chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always good,You can get the tofu scramble burrito ,It is super delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,There was a HUGE line in front of me at lunch time on a rainy day and I got to order my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 You won't be disappointed with the burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some of the best ""Fast food"" ever",I love that you pick everything you want in your burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its chipotle,but still delicious none the less,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Highly recommend this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle I've been too,If you want good chipotle go to the winter springs one or lee vista,I asked for steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A far better vegetarian burrito than Qdoba,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Mexican food,Ordered a burrito,I chose steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the freshness of the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ordered the new crispy tacos ,my tacos had a much,bigger ratio of sauce to taco than i cared for,i let go of chipotle before the spinach fiasco broke out,the chips were actually the saving grace,the guacamole had way too much,they were crispy fresh and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh, (just like every Chipotle) and my burrito barista knew how to roll a mean,burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
makes the best real food for the price, Now this doesn't mean I don't crave the place next door and at times think their food tastes better,it means I realize that I'm not getting food at that other, Being across the street from the mall and still serving decent food, I'm seriously considering driving into Portland or Hillsboro the next time I need my soft tacos ,and lime-y chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,"3 times I requested my food ""to go"" on Monday 2/9", When I got back to my office I was really disappointed to discover the sack did not contain the tortilla chips I ordered, I checked my receipt which confirmed that I was charged for and paid for chips ,What to do with the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it's because the food is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is so amazing,I have never had a bad experience here and the food is always delicious,I often split a burrito bowl with my girlfriend,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food isn't something I'm going to be dreaming about,  And you certainly do get a lot of food for your money,I dropped in here a bit ago with a coupon and gave a carnitas burrito a try,customers pick whether they want a burrito,taco,Prices are,even if the price is higher,bowl (no carbs),and then request various toppings and salsas, I also enjoyed the chips,even though I took most of the chips home for another day,and I would never order chips at $2,happy to accept the coupon for free chips ,select a type of meat,The meat was decently seasoned , I recommend the mild corn which,and I think a salad,but the chain advertises it uses local ingredients , The quality ,but it does taste pretty good,and the vegetables tasted fresh,and taste are definitely miles better than Taco Bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm Mexican so when I want my quick fix of Mexican food ,I got here with my husband he had a burrrito he said it was ok but while I was gettin ready to other I noticed that the pinto Beans color  look awfully weird kinda Grayish idk why i went a head and order a burrito bowl ,and nothing fancy I go to chipotle majority of Mexican,restaurants  around the Boston area sucks so chipotle is not bad,rice ,and chips  the bowl had black,and chicken , beans,but was a bit cold the chips were sooooo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Good food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food ,.food wasn't too greasy,75 for a spoonful of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is high,Newsflash for the people complaining about some of the staff not portioning out enough food,and is priced right,I love the steak and always get that or half and half with chicken,The guacamole is the best I've had anywhere , quality,tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My burrito was wrapped poorly ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like their food ,If I'm paying $7 for a burrito bowl I want a full,About 70% of the time I visit this chipotle they limit the portions, scoop of chicken and a full scoop of rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In addition to the beautiful burrito bowl I was served,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The number of tacos for each person was wrong,the meat was wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Probably was creepy trying to charm someone into giving my extra pork on my salad bowl,I felt like I got gipped on the chicken/pork half n' half,Skimping on the meat is a big,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and some of their employees suck at wrapping burritos,I was tempted to give them three stars because they're on the pricey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was a MONSTER of a burrito,Delicious and gooey in a way that only a quesadilla wrapped burrito could be,"My boyfriend and I were on a hunt for a chipotle after reading a business insider article on the ""secret","menu"" at chipotle",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food quality is AWESOME,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The nice thing about Chiptole is for the most part the food is identical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually like chipotle but the food today was impossible,Salsa and beans were unbearably salty ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had I known all that I would have drove to the other chipotle,15 minute line and when I get to the front no black beans no hot,salsa no forks no napkins they use napkins out of the bathroom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I still go to this location namely because it's close to my house and the food is somewhat healthier than other, We'll likely take a break from coming here for the next month or so but I'm willing to give them another chance just because the food itself is normally consistent, My kids can't seem to get enough of their rice ,there were two where the rice was undercooked, I'm also Chinese so we eat enough rice at home to know , The new batch is slightly better but the rice is still not 100% cooked which leads me to believe that the rice cooker they are using is malfunctioned,and beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I simply love the food,I don't even mind waiting in line to get my two sometimes three soft tacos,enough carbs from beans or rice,the combination of chicken or beef,when they refuse to sell you a small bag of chips for the simple,why throwing away the chips I don't eat,I want to be able to buy a small bag of chips ,heathy fats from guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too many apathetic high school kids behind the counter sloppily handling your food,Too much rice in the burrito's,If you like your burrito's with a pound of white,rice, Smashed beans all over the floor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They ran out of chicken at 4pm on a Sunday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't often go to chipotle anymore (too many great locally owned burrito shops) ,You know you got a good chipotle burrito ,This location was everything I have come to expect from a chipotle: friendly,fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tonight it was lettuce and rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i found a hair in my burrito,chicken was rubbery ,the chips were stale, someone just gave me new chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overall: Great burrito,I was in the mood for a big ass burrito ,The brown rice was a nice addition to the already great burrito,but I was more intrigued because they now serve brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no wonder I got food poisoning,This burrito of mine touched so many,So more hands of moving my burrito out of the way to complete a late,if I have to ask for more rice off the start,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If advertising organic products and gold ingredients means that you sell bland rubbish that doesn't even come close to being actual Mexican food,then Chipotle has the market cornered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Sometimes the guys making your burrito are nice, Once the guy put too much of a few things in my burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Luckily I ordered the burrito bowl ,Portions are always huge to me and this visit I'm pretty sure they added extra rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was so hungry，and food was so good,Yesterday night we went to there to eat after played bowling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have to say chipotle in Portl,but the lady who gave very small portion for rice,I had to ask her to give me little bit more rice after, And the brown rice was too hard,meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I loveeee chipotle and their burrito bowl,The chipotle honey salad dressing is great,But I will still be frequenting chipotle for lunc, on the bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoy the option of creating my own burrito,bowl or tacos ,The chicken ,of the additional toppings like salsas,and I love sampling the different meats,sour cream and cheese are great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoy Chipotle's food,I do enjoy their food,The portions are good for the price,I always get a veggie bowl with guacamole ,the bowls are almost always sloppy,and I've even received meat in my suppose-to-be meatless veggie bowl,and the corn salsa,I've waited 15 minutes for them to make more guacamole before,they run out of key ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Subpar food , After not having Chipotle for many years (once I wised up and realized that a burrito a day was not the healthiest of options),I ordered a burrito bowl , The salsa was extremely runny and the chicken had no flavor, With a glob of cheese,a handful of lettuce thrown on top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never have a problem with the food at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not a particularly patient person when it comes to food,and then was reminded that it's free food ,does this chipotle have the longest lines all the time or is it just me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food at Chipotle is quite good,I am a huge fan of the Vegetarian burrito (black,the price is right,cilantro-lime rice, beans,roasted chili-corn salsa,They will seriously give you all the salsas you want ,There is something about the chips that is delightful,the chips are definitely worth the low,I can't say I'm thrilled about the fact that Chipotle serves naturally-raised meat, guacamole (vegan-safe,And it fills my need to eat all the guacamole I possibly can in one sitting for only $2,romaine lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just went to pick up food that I ordered at 10:00am at 12 ,and the food was 45 minutes late,and food was opened in the box ,not enough chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went here before to try their burrito ,The chicken burrito I had was very bland,There was barley any chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I use their iPhone app to order+pay for a takeaway burrito while still winding down from a workout at the DHAC gym a few,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality had gone downhill,Don't go here unless you have an extra 30 min to wait to receive some of the worst service out of any chipotle I've been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is always good,The rest of the food is fine,it's the guacamole that's good,it does something to the surrounding ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is lack,I hate that they charge you extra for chips and salsa when their product isn't that good anyway and I loathe that there isn't any extra sauce to add to your burrito once it's made,A couple of times I've bitten into my burrito only to realize that some how my nice steamed tortilla has now become a hardened,How that actually happens between me purchasing the burrito ,I desperately wished there were better burrito places in the area where I lived ,with no real seasoning on anything and bland on top of bland with a little bit of salsa on the side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We were hungry and the food was what we were expecting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all type of food burritos,tacos are all fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Fresh fast food at a good price, white rice,I usually order the carnitas bowl,black beans,lettuce ,and corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can only vouch for the veggie bowl at dinner time,fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" They used the last of the chicken on my burrito which was less than usual",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I used to work at chipotle ,The rice ,and guac at this location is great but the chips are very very salty ,and even made chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
employees that can't make food correctly,This is easily the worst chipotle in the local,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fresh,I like that they have added brown rice as a menu option,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How can you be a burrito place ,Do I like their burritos,Other cons: really thick chips,"no ""meal deal"" type option (Freebirds and Qdoba both let you add chips ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The chicken is never fresh, and tastes funny ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only problem with chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really good food ,I always get the burritos which weigh about 2 lbs,I'd love to try something else on the menu but I'm just so in love with the burritos that I'm afraid,Best burrito place around,and good quality as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was worried the food on the counter might be cold, This place is pretty cool with the various combinations you can create or you can go wild and have double everything that'll result in a giant mountain of food,+ Huge amount of food,- Must know how to order or receive less food,- You're getting shafted if you order tacos,order a bowl and ask for side of tortilla or taco, The trick for eating here is going for the bowl ,and you can pretty much ask for extra anything besides meat/guacamole,+ Extra anything at no cost (minus meat/guacamole),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think if I'm going to pay nearly $10 for a burrito I should get my money's worth,I ordered a double wrapped burrito(free,Once I got home burrito was still warm,The past few times I've been to this location there has been a problem (NOT fully cooked rice ,a lot of white rice(free,half pinto beans ,and half black beans(free,and frozen corn salsa),corn salsa(free,) and cheese(free) and a side of corn salsa(free,double steak($2,) and cheese(free,sour cream(free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They truly follow their claim of Food with Integrity and it is delicious and reasonably priced as well, The guacamole is fresh and the salsas all tasty, No watery iceberg lettuce or industrial meats here, Great for vegans and meat-eaters alike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was your average for Chipotle except the steak was way too spicy, There were 3 making food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just walked out paying almost $19 dollars for two chicken bowls with barely any food in it,"moving on to the register she says my total is $19 i asked her how she said ""extra chicken""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good quality and ""fast"" food",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so it's not uncommon to be sitting there right in front of 5 people making 20 burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can't believe I'm complaining about how stingy these guys are when they add on their rice,I always ask for extra rice for some reason,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have been a few times and each time the floors are covered with food from previous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The girl that was fixing our bowls was Extremly rude,She did my bowl ,"I said ""Excuse me Miss"" she ignored and the other girl came and had to redo my boyfriends bowl because the rude one took his bowl",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent food,I love the crispy tacos,Not five stars because the price is a little,medium salsa,With chips and medium salsa,With chips ,guacamole,cheese,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By far the best chipotle in Austin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's crazy considering the fact that Chipotle's stock has been getting hit hard ever since the food contamination scare,The positive is that their churn rate for food products is very high,That brings us to the food,the food at this Chipotle is fine,I grade strictly on food,The food here is solid,I've noticed at several other Chipotles that their burritos are noticeably smaller than before,Second are the chips,The technical term for this is 'slack fill' and in common situations where a company is transporting chips,this empty space is filled with nitrogen to preserve freshness as well as provide a cushion so the chips don't get crushed in transit,Since the chips are in loosely sealed,the only interpretation for the lack of chips is cost-cutting,Last month I vowed to never order another bag of tortilla chips from Chipotle unless they change this practice,Tortilla chips are cheap,you're better off picking up a large bag of tortilla chips ,First is the guacamole,the ingredients are relatively fresh,I had other friends taste it,They taste fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food safety here is a concern,maybe it's my paranoia as gone through many food safety courses for my career,This chipotle gets on my nerves every time I come here,Slowest moving line in any chipotle I have visited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  I think they have the best burritos in town,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love their burritos,usually you don't think much of the rice when you eat a burrito,but what I love most is the rice they use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always enjoy the fast and friendly service not to mention their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got in line at 730 and didn't get our food until 815,The food was excellent,Ordered a burrito bowl with double,Went to this chipotle location near Waterford lakes,The chicken is always so flavorful and blends in nicely with the cilantro rice, chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wayyyy undercooked rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Same old goodness but make me wait for food to cook is a sign that they have lost their mojo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are probably cheaping out on the food also despite the menu clearly saying,they use only fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food,Before I found out that eating their burrito is like eating an entire,teenage version of me could have easily consumed a huge burrito ,I just do their corn tortilla tacos ,but the adult me now starts to sweat on the third taco,If you're craving tacos ,I myself always get the chicken with corn salsa because apparently I've gotten too lazy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well there was a new issue because when we got home the food tasted really weird,It was like the food was full, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the other location hasn't changed and the food is as amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Not only are they overpriced for a beer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are consistently good,but the chips were so depressingly salty that I'm not sure, I'll be able to taste anything for the rest of the day,Do any humans taste test this stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Cherice, A friendly smile and interaction goes a long way and I felt Cherice nailed it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The last six times I've been to this Chipotle there's been a piece of chicken sitting right on top of the sofritas,I wish more than anything that the vegan sofritas were put next to the vegetables instead of the meat,I love that Chipotle gives me more options but what's the point if there's meat mixed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle , The chips are way too salty,I believe it is the type of meat used,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Chipotle is in the food court at the Mall of Millennia, I love the burritos, I've gotten brown rice before in an attempt to be healthier, I love the chicken , The key for me is that I get the hot salsa , That way you get the hot salsa ,and then put sour cream and cheese in it,and the cool sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had the Steak bowl ,and I was really pleased with the tenderness and flavour of the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My pregnant wife and I decided to have our food outside on the patio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Almost every single Sunday I get a Chipotle burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first time I came here my salad was so sparse I could see the bottom of the bowl,ordered a salad and cheese quesadilla,same deal tiny salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In spite of the fact that Chipotle has been on the wrong side of some food safety problems recently, I hope Chipotle recovers from this situation since they still remain my favorite burrito chain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,I just waited in line for 17 minutes to get a bowl,17 minutes for a bowl,but holy guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food there was extremely salty, I'm pretty sensitive to salty food,but my boyfriend who doesn't mind salty food also thought that it was over the top,but even the burritos were just sodium, At first we thought it was just the tortilla chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tasty food, I had the most gigantic burrito ever here, The secret is to ask for both brown and white rice,and both types of beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You would think that a company with prior food contamination concerns would be more conscientious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so they give you less food,and no one likes getting less food,I always get a veggie burrito bowl to go,I love chipotle,Please give me a scoop of guacamole next,The only downfall of this location is that the ingredients are always running low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their burritos are HUGE ,and a hell of alot more reasonable when you consider that a medium end sandwich is the same price ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The taste of the food of course is the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place could care less about customer service and will go as slow as possible making every single burrito or bowl,So I decided to order online and they made sure to leave my chicken off my chicken bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff were not even listening to what I was saying to put into my burrito,They put all three of the salsas into it (not by my request) and I came home to find my burrito in mush,There was also someone in front of me who was apparently an employee which I learned after she was taking very long in line asking for special requests in her burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In regards to the actual food,she over-filled my husband's burrito,When she was helping me with the veggies and salsa,He also mentioned that he didn't ask her for chips ,and guacamole because she just seemed bothered,When she forgot to add the lettuce ,it tasted normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good tasty food, Their food is seasonal,Good price,but for those that aren't just know what you're eating is some high-quality stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So if you want some quick Mexican food that is not Taco Bell,Prices are a bit much,I order the 4 hard Tacos with chicken,all 5 salsas sour,Guacamole and the corn and green tomotolto salsas with a drink,I love their chips, cream cheese and then I order chips, Everything including the guacamole is made fresh,75 for a 3 Chickin Tacos) but you get what you pay for and that is good quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the food is awesome,Knowing that I will be paying for a good food,brown rice,Usually I get carnitas bowl,mild salsa,The guacamole there is just perfect,sour cream and guacamole,And not only is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got home and my burrito has no rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good value for portion of food provided,09 for 2 orders of tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food servers were a bunch of kids that acted like they were being punished for having to work there,three soft tacos,They literally count out the number of meat chunks they put in each taco,They ought to change the name of their steak and chicken tacos to,"""meat flavored tacos",""" Prices are way too high",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And what you get is some high quality Mexican food,I usually get a burrito,They also have hard taco shells,hard taco shell,And they put cilantro in their rice,Cilantro kind of tastes like grass when you put it in rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went there late on a Sunday night (They're open til 10) and the food was just as good,The burrito was filled with deliciousness ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consistently running out of guacamole and/or mild salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got some tasty steak tacos with corn tortillas,.delicious meal for my gluten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was born to be snobbish and picky about any place that claims to make Mexican food,I may not be getting the newborn-sized burritos,I always get the soft flour tacos with chicken,but I still think I deserve more than three tiny chicken bites per taco,and take your tasty tacos home,"Their green ""medium"" salsa is also pretty good",although sometimes they can be stingy with the meat portions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they don't know how to wrap because I got a burrito which they wrapped and added another tortilla shell.food was cold,Food didn't taste the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The foods on br,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
High quality tooth picks provided for the chipotle rice,The chicken is spiced just right,They go to great pains to serve only healthy raised meats, allowing you to taste it long after it is gone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle grill ,and the guacamole very big,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I got a burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when I showed the kid the email that said my food would be ready,Running out of food,Last time I went in (last week) they were out of chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pricey for fast,The beans and rice are really bland,I suggest getting half and half for meat,Expensive fresh good quality fast food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the food is flavorful,let me say that I love burritos,I came here on the free burrito Thursday (the day before the official,Who doesn't love a free burrito,On free burrito day I was in ,I also don't like Qdoba and I heard that Chipotle has a similar rice,The chips are a tad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the beginning everyone working there was new and the food was good,That's when the service and the quality of the food started dwindle,I would buy 2 burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is s typical chipotle,I tend to dislike anything from chipotle however,I have frequented a few other chipotles since this review,I stayed away from the chicken ,and steak which are historically,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,but this chipotle is more expensive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I walked in a woman with darker skin was cleaning around the food bins,She then made my two burritos for me,The quality of the burritos she made was great,I have felt rushed and feel like I am a bother to the employees when asking for certain ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My bowl was delicious,Whoo Hoo y'all finally got the salad dressing right,The salad dressing was so sweet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The workers were friendly and checked in to make sure our food was good,The food was cooked to perfection,and it was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the steak in my burrito bowl was not seasoned ,BUT then I bit into the crunchy undercooked rice,there were many issues with our bowls,My co-worker also had the same issue AND found a tiny bone in her chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other than that the constant lack in ingredients and the terrible burrito wrapping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I really like the fact that they use organic food products ,I normally wouldn't mind but I was not in the mood to have spicy food,This burrito place is not bad, I loved thier guacamole and chips but I was not feeling the burrito,I simply ordered a pork burrito without any hot,sauce and yet my burrito was pretty spicy,what bothered me the most is that I hate cilantro and thier rice was made with it and therefore my burrito was ruined,On the other hand my sister loved her burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Luckily I saw the Queso splash on my food ,The staff handled it as best they could and offered me free chips and to cook me more food ,I have to be sure my food is safe,Each splash was like a stab in back since for the last few years chipotle has been one of the few,The hard cheese hasn't been an issue because the items near it have duplicates kept separately ,and into all the other ingredients - it really went far,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And fresh food that I can't get enough,Great prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If they are running low on food they will scoop out the little,I'm a chipotle lover ,but keep pushing your bowl down the line so you get a half @,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95 for guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you will be ordering your delicious h,Good quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Despite this location being in a food court, It seems to me that every time a shop (of any restaurant) opens in a food court, This location is almost as good as most Chipotle locations and since they don't really have to do much other than make food,the quality suffers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but honestly I would rather pay for food with a competent,level of service rather than go through all this for free food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alright no much different from many other chipotle in the area is just that this one are very stingy,with the meat they would give you a misery amount of meat compare to others in the area so don't recommend this chipotl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had carnitas burrito w/gu,spread the guacamole  to cover tortilla before they lay rice down,every ingredient,so u get a taste in every bit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I tryed a chicken burrito with black,Not bad and the burrito had just the right,beans,medium hot sauce and corn salsa,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like the salad I do not care for their burritos they're too thick,They also do free sour cream,The only thing I would change is to add more lettuce,The salads are nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cheap with the rice,Cheap with the beans,Never any salt on the chips,Cheap with the meat,"Chicks behind the counter don't understand ""No guacamole"" even though its the same",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I think they over served every burrito , I had cilantro lime rice,and bowl ,chicken,black beans,cheese,corn and sour cream,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can get a huge burrito or all the fixings ,and toppings with rice in a bowl, I ordered chicken ,I'll add some guacamole too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I haven't spent much time in Oaxaca but I would imagine that Chipotle's food is about as authentic,however I nonethless enjoy the burritos here,Weak spots would be the rice,the corn salsa in particular,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bowls and burritos looked great,There was barely any lettuce in comparison to my husbands bowl,What was served was more like a giant soggy sour cream salsa, but was looking forward to a nice salad,Definitely not what I was looking for when I think of a salad (Picture posted),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I used to love Chipotle @ Waterford a lot but tonight the food there was not as tasty,The steak is so bland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a Chicken Burrito bowl with all of the toppings , Now onto the bowl,Almost every piece of chicken in my bowl was uncooked,I explained to her that the chicken in my bowl was raw,That must have been one big freaking chicken because almost every piece in my bowl was raw,uncooked chicken is not my favorite," His response was per the manager ""it was probably a big piece of the chicken",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always great customer service and the quality of food is amazing,Best chipotle of any i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let's get to the food,I ordered chicken burrito this afternoon ,I expect a little spiciness but the burrito lagged any flavor,like rice, beans but hardly 4-5 small pieces of chicken,salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but recently I went to the one in Dedham and I got the same burrito I always get ,Not happy that the water was almost half the price of my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
& the price is pretty,LOVE their chips & guac, decent for the quality it serves up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the reason why was that they're generally getting more food,  The food was pretty consistent, but I know I just paid a higher than A&W price for that food, The food is decent,and I get a burrito,  My burrito was pretty stacked with meat while the rice , EVERY SINGLE TIME I went to the downtown location it looked like a burrito or bowl was scattered over the floor ,The wife usually gets a bowl, I should have looked around and seen that 90% of the people in there were going bowl,and beans were more scarce,one person right next to the check out person was only responsible for asking if I wanted a drink or chips and salsa,and ask the salsa person for a cup of salsa while getting a cup out while waiting for said salsa,  could not the register person ask that question and reach back for some chips, my wife got mostly meat, with the taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very consistent quality service and food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I needed burritos the size of my head, The burritos are thick, I know few tastes combinations that are as immediately rewarding as Chipotle's cheese-rice-sour, Only the chips fail to live up to the st,the guacamole is as fine,and the ingredients are fresher than you'd find in most restaurant,though this may be more about my personal taste than a flaw in the execution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great food,By far one of the best chipotle franchises around in the area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good quality Mexican food,Only reason for the 3 stars is the clean restaurants and somewhat descent prices,The steak is hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered online bc I have a short lunch break and arrived 2 min after my pick up time and the food wasn't even started,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No white rice no chips ,and no chicken,How do you not have chips,So many nights I'm chasing either the hingham store because the Braintree store has no vinaigrette dressing or the Braintree store because the hingham store is out of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice wasn't cooked all the way---crunch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is always the same, high quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like to get the burrito,I prefer white rice,Very fresh ingredients,I don't know why but I feel that this location taste way better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have had hair in my food,ripped burrito skins,crushed chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Ordered my usual burrito bowl or so I thought, Or give you 6-7 pieces of junk lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Extremely disappointed in this chipotle - it may have ruined my entire,when I came to Orlando on vacation I HAD to go to chipotle,I would NOT recommend this chipotle to anyone - no matter how much you are craving it,I have never in my life felt so disgusted eating rice,Their rice was SO soggy,I got the rice anyways,I tried to enjoy it as much as possible but the soggy rice ruined everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
regular price,Extra chicken is an extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is no fresh food in any containers,white and brown rice etc the staff preparing the food does not listen,white rice ,"""Can I have a very small amount of salsa"" and they're so robotic they load a full ladle on there then when you tell them you don't want all that they attempt to scrape the salsa out of the bowl instead of making a new",They're out of chicken,and chicken WO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Service is brutal and the food doesn't even taste the same,Worst chipotle I have ever been to, as the chipotle's I've been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food sometimes is hit,I love coming here to grab a burrito or bowl,There have been a few times the chicken is burnt,I've also seen an employee drop a marker in the lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I hate when places ask me how to make their food,#1 - They don't know how to make a burrito, When you order a burrito they ask what you want on it,The burrito ends up being a liquidy mess with too much,#2 - The burrito is a bomb ready, salsa,guacamole,sour cream, It's like trying to eat a water balloon filled with sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No matter the location the food always tastes the same,They gave such a huge portion here for the burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better Chipotle opens in NW Austin because I think they make good food ,To his credit the manager packed up a little ramekin of barbacoa for me to add to my burrito,because they make the sloppiest soft tacos I've ever seen , The manager indicated that they cut the portion from 5oz to 4oz due to increased meat prices,and they've started totally skimping on the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are way too big,Prices are average if a little high but I guess $6 isn't much for a burrito you can eat all day long,There is a weird little outdoor seating patio so you can eat your burrito al fresco,But I'll stick with Taco Loco for my burrito needs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ok - I like the food here,At this point I have to have my son or wife order the food ,The food Is 5 stars,Basic food,each of whom has memorized the menu and the applicable fixings for each option (burrito vs quesadilla) ,and therefore more often than not avoid the scorn of the employees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it takes about 20 minutes to get your food here- so much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff is so friendly and the food is not full, of chemicals or high frucose corn syrup ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is hands down the best fast-food restaurant available,burritos/salads/tacos/bowls are customizable,Make sure to try the barbacoa with corn salsa,Fresh ingredients, and made right in front of you and it tastes DELICIOUS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 People that I passed at the door were just making it along the grill on the right of the place by the time I got my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They have failed on the most basic and quintessential element of a great burrito - wrapping,ordered a burrito, I brought home a burrito today only to find that it had been loosely put together to where the foil didn't even reach around the sides, It might be okay if I had ordered something with double meat or an extremely large burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,and the burritos are stuffed HUGE,Worth the $- the guacamole is awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been in way longer chipotle lines that move faster,Came for chicken ,+ meat cut in chunks way too big,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's not authentic Mexican food ,"I specifically told her ""medium"" and ""hot"" sauces for my burrito ",I told her I didn't want that and she pushed the burrito up,I decided to just continue with my now-ruined burrito ,and she rolled it up with all the salsa and oozy liquid coming out of the burrito (VERY MESSY),Instead of the burrito that I wanted,it ended up being like a burrito bowl,until I got to the salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hands down my favorite burrito place,The dining area and burrito assembly line are both super,The burrito bowls w/ beans ,reasonable prices ,flavorful variety of salsas,The roasted chili corn salsa,tomatillo red & green chili salsas add spice ,succulent meat,Vegetarian feed with no animal by-products meat ,high quality ingredients,I love the tender and delicious: No added growth hormones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No complaints about portion size or quality and it's definitely a leg up on food court fare,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All of the meal options are delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's because of the quality of the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito is always good,usually the chips are way over salted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I visited this Chipotle for the first time on a free burrito day,Not every day can be free burrito day,com to try to confirm the free burrito promotion before we went,The staff on the burrito assembly line were super,when I went to chipotle,The fact that we got a huge dinner for $5 (only paid for drinks and some chips n' guac) bumps it up to four stars,Burritos were huge and pretty tasty (although too heavy on cilantro for my taste),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
con menú variado y sobre todo porque tienes opción de elegir los ingredientes que más te gusta,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are significantly bigger than Anna's,The best burrito you can get here:,rice,black beans,half corn salsa,half hot red salsa,"this is ""non-standard"" (two salsas) ",and I find the meat much more flavorful,cheese,but a few times it's been obvious the ingredients have been sitting out too long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had never stood in line waiting for food or even to order food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 You order at one end of a long line and they pass your food down from server to server so you can tell them what you want for cheese,but when we looked closer we saw there were four meat or veggie options for you to customize in burritos,What I really appreciate about their menu is the bowl option - you can select any standard burrito filling to eat out of a bowl ,tacos,rice,bowls,filling your bowl with lean,and salsas,and any of the fresh salsas, Try the corn salsa - it is flavorful,but not super spicy and is a nice alternative to traditional tomato salsa,They also do not have a dessert menu and strangely are frequently out of either chips or guacamole, meat, If you stay away from the cheese , They will make you a miniature complimentary cheese quesadilla,"though - basically just some shredded cheese grilled in a 5"" round tortilla",which is not all that different from the old kid's standby grilled cheese s,and sour cream as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you buy a cake at whole foods you are still going to get fat,I'm guessing that the market for burrito places wasn't as big,burrito or taco) meat (usuals) ,I liked the burrito I got,Why don't you let people get single tacos or mini quesadilla,and salsa,Then there is lettuce and sour cream,You get a choice of style (salad,(And quit shoving the natural ingredient shit down my throat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is good,Just like any other chipotle,My chipotle fix is always satisfied here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is why I never eat Mexican food,The first time I had chipotle was a really enjoyable,It's a shame that chipotle got caught in that e coli crisis because it definitely gives me 2nd thoughts about going bac,I hate beans,But for once I could skip the beans ,I got the carnita and the meat was delicious,The sour cream made it feel very light,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place serves great food,They definitely satisfy you with the food they serve ,I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for cheap and good Mexican food,They are very quick to put what I want on my plate or burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burritos are alright for the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What a waste of time and money Taco Bell would have been just as good,burrito terrible",won't be coming back chipotle or do you mean El Cheap O,and $3 for a tablespoon of cheese dip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too bad the food is delicious,"So I try and get a ""quick"" burrito bowl at this train wreck of a location only to be greeted by sourpuss the manager at the burrito machine",) By the time they decided to do something like pull out a manual credit card slip my burrito was cold,This location has run out of cooked chicken twice on me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast delicious food for a great,The quality of the food here is superb,There's typically at least a 20mins wait before I can get start making my food,price,I feel pretty great about eating here too because they give me the option of having brown rice,25 I can have one of the best chicken bowls topped with all my favorite,fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is OKAY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They'll do whatever you want to your food,Definitely not authentic but very delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is usually kept fresh,I go here for lunch once and awhile and get the classic burrito,The staff is very good at this location and makes a consistently good burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Chipotle so when I saw this is the food-court I knew it was where I would be eating,I figured first thing should be nice fresh food rather then leftovers,The staff was friendly despite it being just after 11am and the service was quick but when I dug into my bowl,the meat was cold like it was the meat from the night before that came out the fridge in the morning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just really good food, Chicken burrito bowl is my fave, Simple fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And I understand nobody is perfectly efficient so I will typically state my pickup time 5-10 minutes earlier just to be sure it's ready for me because I am grabbing my food to go,Chipotle burritos as amazing ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food, The food is being made so it's not like the kitchen isn't producing fast enough, I know youre the only location in the area but one of these days people are gonna wise up and make that farther drive or figure out overpriced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito was probably the worst I have had at Chipotle,The meat was overcooked and dry and the rice was undercooked,they had no guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is located inside Mall at Millenia,Overall I still love this chipotle ,Either way they normally forget something or put something in my bowl I wanted on the side,Once notified they are usually great about replacing the bowl or giving you the topping they forgot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast food of burritos ,and tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aside from the awesome staff the food here is the best,the chicken ,the guacamole ,and sour cream is nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reasonably fresh chips,great guacamole,The Chipotle is in a suburban corner lot development like tens of thous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I gladly drive an extra 10 minutes up to crosswoods chipotle where the food ,I recently moved to the area and I have to say this is the WORST chipotle I have ever been to,Many ingredients are over-salted,They frequently run out of ingredients well before close ,and service quality are great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't understand how so many staff members could disregard the basic food h,I shouldn't have to ask employees to remake my food OR change their gloves,I order a veggie burrito ,and I shouldn't have to worry about cross contamination or meat juices all over my burrito,  He did offer to buy me a burrito ,First of all I just want to say that I love chipotle,and watch the woman scooping meat - using her h,and to keep the meat in the scoop - then rub her meaty,I am vegan and have been meat free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered through the online app and wanted steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21 extra) and the food was freshly made,I really like the pricing and portion and how you choose from burrito/bowl/tacos or salad for the same, price,95) on a bowl with Guacamole($2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Whether they forget to give me things or just totally screw up my burrito bowl,no matter how badly I want a burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"
salsa (chunky tomato ","whatever happened to ""saucy"" salsa",Chips and guac make up for the mediocre salsa,I'm not too concerned that this is a chain b/c I love the fact that the meat has no antibiotics or growth hormones ,So delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A lady working there took half the rice from an online order burrito ,No longer a chipotle fan,Guacamole is super plain with no flavor and overpriced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First time at this chipotle location,The rice was very hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In town for business and during my week I picked up food 3 times from this Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
today's to go burrito order was prepared as a burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food at this location is good, Order your food , They stay on top of that and let the rest of the chips fall as they may (HA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the young man waiting on me decided to take  a two minute break to play with the rice ,I got a chicken bowl with no rice or beans,he seemed completely annoyed by the fact that he had to make another chicken bowl,He barely gave me any chicken so I had to ask for more,The next three customers had similar experiences and each of them had to ask for more chicken,My chicken was ok,and beans instead of taking my order,My lettuce was fresh, as were the other ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Mexican food,I love burritos ,but I don't love Chipotle or their burritos,Now I have come to realize that $6 + is to much money to pay for a burrito that is not assembled tightly enough (explodes ,and spills everything out once you remove the tin foil) and robotic servers who don't get the order correctly when you ask for a variation of the standard burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I never have had a problem with being over served but they put so much food on the burrito (without asking for double,Just ordered a burrito bowl ,and a burrito,The guacamole had huge chunks of un-ripe avocado in the burrito bowl ,However the burrito was the problem,The burrito still looks terrible,I always go to this chipotle ,"After waiting and watching three people attempt to wrap it and fail and make a scene I simply said ""could you please just throw it in a bowl I am in a rush)", meat or veggies) that they couldn't close it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They constantly make their food fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 When I asked for fajitas for my bowl,invariably they're out of some ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can usually see the food being cooked fresh,Fairly healthy - nice to have the option to get the bowl instead of the burrito,Reasonably priced  - except for the $2 per scoop of guac,This location in Dedham is better than most in that the workers generally aren't skimpy with the scoops of chicken or rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fresh food,"The quality is always good for being ""fast"" food",Good food,They are constantly out of very key ingredients(chicken,cheese,and sour cream) well before closing time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It also doesn't make sense how people in line behind you can order to go food through the app ,and get their food before people that were already waiting in line,I'm a loyal chipotle customer,This is your average chipotle,This chipotle needs to get their act together ,Use the to go stations in the back for to go orders (as other high volume chipotles do),I would avoid this chipotle if possible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The chicken burritos are freakin, I don't know what they're using for a marinade on the chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,and lots of rice burrito I was given a smile ,The nice lady who wrapped my burrito gave me a huge, and even though you can't see it from the way I dissected my burrito,Good qualities that I've come to expect from chipotle,best chipotle experience I've had in a while,Others wrote that this location skimps on the meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
without wrapping a burrito sloppy,Their meat is seasoned very well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a bowl with chicken,They asked me if I wanted double chicken ,It then took five minutes for them to refill the cheese while one guy just walked over grabbed what he needed for a specific,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sorry chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's a vegetarian burrito option for those who cannot eat meat,It serves more filling burritos than Taco Bell does,or people who just don't feel like fighting to get a huge burrito into their mouths,there's a burrito bowl option,Their chips are delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love how people get on here and complain about what they get when they really don't know anything about food or the food industry in general,so you might as well go somewhere Non-Mexican if you don't want it in your food,if you don't like hot food,Mexican tends to not be the best food option for you,which tends to be better on food anyway (mostly because it is fresh,This isn't considered Mexican food,You don't find real Mexican food in most of the country,We Americanize everything just because we don't like to eat the same styles of food,I don't discriminate on my food,so you are not getting any frozen foods there,they prep the food everyday,so where do I get the Stage 4 Chipotle food for her,simply for burrito quality,Your burrito should not be falling apart because the tortilla is too damp,which results in a very soggy burrito,That is not to be had in any kind of good burrito,someone on here complained about cilantro being in the rice ,I know at Chipotle that the salsa has different,who was complaining about cold cheese,room temperature cheese,it has to be either cool or it would have to be like nacho cheese (warmed),but the corn also is considered spicy,cilantro is a very popular Mexican ingredient,I thought there was one more ingredient they had,The ingredients at Qdoba are all wet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's my go to food ,I haven't had any problem with the food quality or the service other,I love chipotle,BUT This chipotle ALWAYS has a line wrapped around the restaurant,To be fair the next nearest chipotle is on university ,Ordering online still ends up having you waiting (they seem to wait until the absolute last minute to put together your bowl) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The line for food was so long ,One thing that bothered me was that the staff preparing my food were not friendly,The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because I love the food it tastes amazing ,but this specific chipotle needs some improvements,She charged me for steak when I had chicken ,and didn't even ask me what kind of meat I had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you really want chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They make you feel like a homeless guy who is getting free food ,I asked for 4 burrito bowls ,Almost every time I go there I struggle just to add as little more rice ,I asked for the extra rice he added just a little,I'm giving it two stars coz if the amount of rice they put ,To cover up the shortage in rice,Then they pass the bowls to the next,They added Lettuce to two of the bowls which I said they shouldn't ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's always a long line up and there's ALWAYS multiple people INHALING their food,foods good,Priced well for what you get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even the brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but this one has something wrong with its black beans,Fix the beans,five stars based on quality,They taste sweet for some reason,so I'm very attuned to how it should taste,taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is nothing great,the food was fresh,Overpriced , and overpriced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I was on time to pick up my food , I had a bag of chips with our order, My daughter's kids meal comes with a very small bag of chips, It maybe a longer drive but at least the quality is a lot better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The portions are tiny and for some reason nobody here can actually figure out how to form a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When we walked in the line was almost out the door and there was one person making food while another guy was at the end of the counter on his phone texting,he put our food in a bag ,And the worse part the food wasn't good,They skimped on my boyfriend's burrito bowl as well,I ordered a steak quesadilla ,and no joke he maybe put way smaller than a handful of steak on my tortilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He calls Chipotle and they could do NOTHING for him they said he had to call Door Dash even though they messed up the order and gave the driver the wrong food,I will never go there again- mediocre food (,He orders a chicken burrito ,The order is delivered- and it is a burrito bowl - not what he ordered,my son who is at home asks if he could order chipotle ,and chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No hard shell tacos,no soft shell tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm certified in food safety ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff is very nice and gives a good portion of guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chicken was salty ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freshest chipotle food I've ever had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She rolled my burrito up,"""What kind of rice","no rice please""","""Umm could I get a bowl please","""Black beans",cheese,guac and sour cream,It's kind of hard to write this because it's absolutely delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is typical,good Chipotle quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my burrito online ,"Only after finishing my burrito did I realize that they mistakened by comment for ""extra",or rice :( After everything,I didn't get any beans," vegetables"" as only vegetables and meat",cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finally a place to get half decent burritos in Woburn,the pork burrito ($6,at least I can order my burrito ahead online ,beans (choice of black,and sour cream,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is ok,Not to mention they make a big fuss about the chips if you ask for extra,Be prepared to be embarrassed if you ask for extra chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would say the tomato salsa was quite salty though and would suggest dialing back on the salt for the salsa that goes on bowls as all other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes amazing however the food quality has been going down,- foods never actually ready,in fact usually they don't even start on my food until I show up,- three burritos ,- rice was mushy,and one bowl for the family,- I feel like the pinto beans changed ,Plus chips,- the chips were good,- steak was too chewy,its like they spooned on 3-4 ladles of sour cream,been here a hundred times and feel over the last 6-9 months the quality has been really sinking into the crapper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We are ordering our food ,and the young girl behind the counter was throwing the food into the container,We asked for salsa on the side and she tossed a large spoonful right on top of the bowl, threw the bowl across in the trash,sending things flying and huffed and puffed to go make a new one but didn't ask what was in it and then forgot the beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chipotle is amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the third comes from the food which is decent,it is a very decent place for grabbing a burrito or  fajita,that your salsa does not arrive in a frozen,the meat is hormone,and the guacamole is fresh,"but very often you'll eat milk protein and a bunch of nasty stuff in a ""guacamole"" that should bear a warning sign instead of a label",do you mean that your guacamole is not a '99,- to my taste- ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hey guys I came in yesterday and you guys forgot my burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
brown rice,I ask for extra lettuce at the end twice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was quite impressed with how easy and efficient their online ordering capabiliites are as well as how fresh the food was ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Same food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get your food,The burritos here are massive,You can make your meal how you wish but seeing whole chicken grilled behind the assembly staff is a good, sign that they are using real meat ,and the guacamole is fresh,As mentioned in other posts the clientèle can be obnoxious and because you are in close corners there's no real,hormone free ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The management here and corporate refuse to have a clean restaurant that follow food safety laws,If you like unclean food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chipotle had much more flavor ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice not so much,it seemed to taste just like Clumpy white rice with no flavor to me,I ordered the Chicken Burrito (Or Just bowl here) ,All in all it was a decent bowl - ,The chicken RIGHT AWAY almost tastier than Qdoba, I wish I could take their chicken & Corn Salsa ,The Guac and chips was decent,the corn was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I haven't been back since and won't eat at any chipotle because of my awful,I understand this place was extremely busy when they first opened but serving me raw chicken was the worst mistake they could have made,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All food was fresh,Best burrito place ever, and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For the same price I'd rather go to Freshii downstairs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered soft shell chicken tacos ,Do you not know how to make tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10 min for these dopes to refill the lettuce at 4 pm on a Monday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm talking about big-hunking burritos,Of all the big-hunking burrito chains,I asked for the small size burrito while indicating the size with my h,For a burrito ,but I walked out thinking that I could buy an avocado for less and mash it up and put it in the burrito myself,She asked me if I wanted beans and rice,no rice,So she pulls out the tortilla and I see her scoop up the rice ,"and I said ""no rice please",I said black beans,just beans,She asked me if I wanted guacamole ,I found out that dollop of guacamole cost $1,A dollar fifty for guacamole is highway robbery,Does your guacamole make me poo,they just do not offer a big enough variety for my taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pork was dry and Qdodas green salsa is the bomb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And their salsas are a little on the spicy side (negative for me seeing as I dislike spicy food),I walked in and started considering what I would order right away and noticed one unique thing about Chipotle's menu--the fact that you order everything separately (as opposed to drink/chip/burrito combos),This basically means that a burrito is about $6,the size of the burrito was a little,And the chicken burrito ,"Next time I will probably try to ""burrito bowl",""" which is basically a chicken burrito in a bowl without a tortilla",But I loved the lime infused rice,if you want chips and salsa it's an extra,"you might ask yourself ""do I REALLY need chips and salsa",and chips I ordered were very tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited 20mins for them to make chicken,Multiple times I've Been they have run out of meat all the time without any backed up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,always so packed though which is a good thing because it means it's good but could also mean food is served too fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At these prices I should not walk away hungry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know it's busy but it's like a zoo in there and the burrito building is sloppy,Not impressed with this particular chipotle location,I would rather stop on sawmill or Polaris to get my chipotle fix,Maybe in time because I do love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I sat down to eat my food ,it moved fast as the workers assembled burritos,and tacos quickly which left for little,When I stepped up to get my bowl assembled I ordered brown rice (which I felt she put far too much,The brown rice was extremely under-cooked,Then there was SO MUCH rice that it honestly overtook the entire,bowl,there was still a lot of bite to it and it was kind of crunchy which made eating the bowl a chore, bowl,salsa verde,corn salsa,The meat was parched),cheese,sour cream,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is great,but don't buy food online,i called chipotle ,i called doordash and they tell me its no their fault call chipotle,i call chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,Just rice veggies ,and if you dont get sour cream or gauc and any of the chips,and chciken or steak is a clean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fluffy rice makes a puffy burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It's in everything rice salsa, guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't get me wrong the food is amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They make big fat burritos with a good,chicken,I love that they use organic ingredients,where you tell them your desired ingredients one at a time as you move down the line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
while the order here line has had at least 40+ people come & go with their food,All over two burritos & a side of queso,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location continues to decline in customer service and food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad food,she tells the girl wrapping my burrito that it wasn't her fault for not being able,they put extra sour cream on my burrito,the rice was so under cooked that it was crunchy,it was mine for requesting double meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Asked for double meat twice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Go somewhere else in the food court,it's not up to par with other chipotles,After spending over $10 on a bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service is fast and the food is fine,Chipotle food stuffs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reasonably priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd rather go to any other chipotle now because frankly his isn't the first,Was extremely disappointed when i got home to open my bowls to find one of my bowls correct for my girl friend but my vegetarian bowl was missing rice ,ordered online today for 2 bowls,showing I'm not wrong and that my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would love to give Chipotle five stars because I love their food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How can making burritos take this long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I said I have a food allergy at the beginning so she changed her gloves,They changed after placing hands all over and inside the bowl ,and gave me a salsa that was pre made,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I guess it is safe to say they won't do a complimentary mini cheese quesadilla anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tasty burrito, I don't know who came up with the concept of the modern burrito,Since Chipotle burritos are custom,let me give you my recommendation on the #1 best burrito that can be made from the ingredients Chipotle offers,Approved and Guaranteed burrito,and that there are other specialty burrito chains,with rice,beans, That means no corn salsa,specialty meats,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Chipotle and I will continue to visit this establishment because I am obsessed with burritos ,and burrito bowls,The one critique I have for this chipotle is that you need to take a lesson in speedy,service from the chipotle on University,That chipotle is amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always so nice and give a very good amount of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only is the food delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But other than that the food is grea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
healthy Mexican food,guacamole-drenched burrito from King Burrito,reasonably priced,Its price has been consistently going up ,meat does my conscious,We all know its taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But seriously the food is fresh,I personally recommend the carnitas (pulled pork) in a fajita burrito with the guacamole,The chips and salsa are also delicious but not always necessary since the burritos are amazingly filling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On several occasions there has been a younger girl who has been tasked with wrapping my burrito,I opened my burrito (which was wrapped in two layers of tin foil to hide the mistake) ,As I was eating it ingredients poured out of the side of the burrito,The staff is efficient but the lack of quality in wrapping a burrito can make or break the overall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a few orders of the 3 tacos,I got the steak tacos,chicken and steak combo tacos,steak and pork combos tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always old,the attitude is horrible when they make your food,I just want the same quality of food I get at the other,It is a complete waste of money eating here unless you manage to get the two or three ladies who actually know how to make the food,Hands down one of the worst chipotles ever been to,It's frustrating considering it's the closest chipotle to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service is OK but the food is generally below,The North Quincy shop is much better in terms of quality of food,While I still eat here all the time I find that the Hingham branch has gotten consistently worse in comparison to the other chipotles,The chicken is burnt more times than not ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was bland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't even think about the salad dressing,This location skimps on ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle as much as the next,I paid 8 dollars for a bowl that had barely anything in it,and all the other stuff (beans,salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I got a ""free burrito"" coupon in the mail",I got the Barbacoa burrito with all the toppings: black,rice,Though I am extremely happy to not have to pay the $7+ price tag along with it, beans,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is terrible,They don't seem to know how to properly manage their food line,We received a bunch of free burrito coupons due,Now that our free burrito coupons have been used,I would rather drive an extra 20 minutes to the next closest chipotle than ever step foot into this location again,When they run low they attempt to give super small spoonfuls of rice ,The chips are usually stale,and meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
poor service and skimped me on the burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every scooping portion was perfect and my burrito was one of the best burritos I've had in all my years of going to Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I was so hungry and had been craving Chipotle but was sad when I was going to have a basic bowl with no sofritas or guacamole:(  however the Manager saved the day , I had to wait and he even made me a fresh bowl after, I'm vegetarian and went in one evening and they had run out of the tofu based option and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love your food Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always fresh food, The prices are very reasonable,It's great to see that they now offer brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The serving amounts in my burrito (Beans,The burrito had to be wrapped twice because it fell apart the first,rice,meat,Barely any meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great for food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gotta love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other than that it was good food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle has always been my go-to place for a quick delicious meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The medium was so hot it rendered the food inedible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 An employee was wiping down the tables and asked us how we were doing and how we liked the food,I found the chicken , Loved seeing the chicken/meat being grilled fresh,guacamole was delicious,and the steak to be quite tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once you order your food it will take you to a payment option in which you can put in your credit card info or choose to pay ,The only negative is the food may be warm by the time you get,My GF called me on the way home from work to remind me that today was free teacher day at chipotle,Once you get on chipotle,white rice,I ordered the bowl with extra,My gf ordered a bowl as well , chicken,Also I ordered double chicken ,black beans,and we ordered chips with guac,cheese,sour cream ,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I took advantage of recent free burrito offer,lime rice,why so much rice,Naturally raised chicken (+1 point),black beans,a couple salsa choices (mild ,Baby also had a cold cold heart of sour cream and cheese that did not manage to permeate the rest of the ingredients ,white cheese,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I come to Chipotle because the food is fresh,I understand that there was a romaine lettuce recall ,but they had no lettuce at all,There are so many other kinds of lettuce ,they were also out of crisy corn shells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I almost feel like I see a new face everytime I come into chipotle but none the less they are still able to offer the some consistency I hope for after my 30 minutes ride to the restaurant my burrito means a lot to me trust m,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fresh and yummy ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Place was in need of a cleaning but staff were busy preparing food for customers,I stopped by for a salad bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was in and out of this chipotle in 5 minutes tops,best chipotle experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I called in the order (although you can also order online or with a fax) and the food was all ready,the food has either been ready,The last thing I'd like to mention is the quality of the food,I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone looking for delicious food, The burritos are *,good prices, The chips are really good,big* and stuffed with what you choose (as opposed to other places which skimp on ingredients),) and the ingredients are always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its pretty decent burrito joint,The bowl is also pretty good, and I usually get the steak because they have just the right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dont give you sour cream and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will stop coming to chipotle for good,Plus they start giving customers no meat after they charge you for it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the low quality chicken,and beans were very obvious,lettuce,I can tell this location is buying low quality ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice,beans and chicken had no flavor at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really shitty service plenty of people working but the guy making the burritos was an absolute,way to much sour cream and cheese and way to much rice I had to throw away my burrito halfway because there was absolutely no chicken in it,57$ for a burrito that's hi,i expect i much more quality burrito for the price especially ,Place isn't very sanitary either probably my worst experience at chipotle so far ,when you can go to any pizza place and order a full medium pizza for that price,only gave me half a scoop of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the middle of our order they stopped it to take online orders and forgot about my husbands burrito ,I've been coming to this chipotle for over 3 yrs ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The burritos are huge,My boyfriend usually gets a chicken burrito which he loves , My boyfriend's son never knew what he was missing until we took him to Chipotle and he tried the kid's tacos,and his son gets the kid's Make Your Own taco kit,rice, You don't have to worry about hidden chicken stock or lard here,The only thing I would like to see is if this Dedham location Chipotle would add the Gardein (vegan chicken) to their menu like some other,I love how vegan friend Chipotle is with their black beans, You can get different types of salsa too, And the kids comes with a bag of chips - yum,They get their protein (he chooses the shredded pork because it's the least spicy) and then adds 2 toppings - cheese,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff are more focused on goofing off and socializing than prepping food or taking orders,The rice ,and chicken had no flavor,steak is always fatty/chewy as if this restaurant was using a completely different,type of steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you can get food,chicken ,they were out of steak,they're out of lettuce and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zero tolerance for places that serve food making their workers come in sick,Nobody wants to buy food from someone who's coughing,Now were stuck with food we can't eat,Zero stars for selling food you can't eat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The boy who heats up the tortillas and gets your rice was so sweet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Explosive burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was such a refreshing trip for food after traveling,Of course the food was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is price moderately ,Great place if u like mexican food,nothing extravagant just good Mexican food,Had a ice cold beer with my chicken burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a lot of food,and usually scarf down the fajita burrito, If I'm going to shell out 6 bucks for a burrito,In a city that lacks good burrito joints,the spicy chicken, I like not having beans forced upon me,fresh cheese,the cool sour cream,all the ingredients in front of me, We're here to discuss the sublime deliciousness that is Chipotle, All the different tastes coming together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food in this location is really bad,the people is really nice but is not well prepare just check the guacamole taste of old,avocados and it was ready black by the time I got it cilantro was also black inside of the guacamole the best location is the one on tanasbur,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this became my new food joint by default,my burrito bowls are always half the size they should be (why are they always skimping on food,especially the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and they have NEVER rolled my burrito properly,I've been to many chipotles,I love chipotle,But I hate this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a barbacoa bowl ,and I had so little meat that the cashier thought I had a veggie bowl,I think they were trying to move the line as quick as they could and the quality was not very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but Chipotle is consistently great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Chipotle was one of the worst chipotle' I've ever been to,Will definitely drive out of my way to go to another chipotle,My boyfriend and I ordered chips ,The cashier also gave us an attitude when ordering the queso and chips,Also they were somehow out of sour cream,The drink machine area was a distasteful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband wanted a burrito,Same young lady who first attempted my husbands burrito made them ,My tacos were the most ridiculous,One taco literally had 1 piece of corn on it,Another had so much sour cream (about 1/3 cup) I had to scrape it off, When he asked for a side of sour cream for us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will stop coming to chipotle for good,Plus they start giving customers no meat after they charge you for i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got my food at 9:55pm,You just opened a chipotle (one that is too small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I either get the tacos or burrito depending on how hungry,but the burrito is HUGE,The tacos fill you up for sure,I am with their spicy-ish chicken (it may not be spicy to other,I can't resist the guacamole because I love the stuff ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
made the best damn salad I've ever had at chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location reminded me that Chipotle is capable of making food that actually has flavor,I had been frequenting a location near where I work and apparently it lowered my taste st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the only bad experience I've had with the food chain too,I read the reviews and was excited to try this chipotle while on vacation,I don't even want to try chipotle again because of this experience,even though we gave them back the bowl with the dead,then kept trying and refunded just my bowl,I found a dead bug on my lettuce ,tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's always packed here so we try to order our food in advance for pickup to avoid the wait time,It's chipotle so therefore it's good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When our food came to our workplace,I was shocked at the amount if food they gave,You get to choose between burrito bowl,burrito wrap,taco,soft tacos or a salad,white rice ,All of my coworkers ordered the bowl ,I chose the chicken bowl with guacamole,I devoured the entire bowl ,Their chicken is definetly not dry,fresh salsa,roasted corn salsa,green salsa,cheese,and lettuce,soft s or a salad,however Chipotle's ingredients are high, quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
) and it is WAY over priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,I guess it's a quality problem they have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also food portion always are small,I am going to other chipotle locati,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it took fifteen minutes just to get food, Hot foods should be kept at 140 degrees ,and cold foods should be kept at 40 degrees,- I explained the food related,no one wants to listen to rap or hip hop while eating a burrito off of a table that's vibrating from the bass,- The lettuce on my burrito bowl was rotten,Pros:  This place offers Tex Mex at a fair price,rice,- The chicken,and beans were served at the incorrect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Started ordering via chipotle app since this place always has a 15min line up,Decent portion decent price great,I always get their chicken bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food suffers,the food started piling up,) this is a problem because the hot food is just sitting there out in the open,The food starts to lose its warmth,For the most part this doesn't change regardless of which chipotle I go,This last experience at this chipotle,A previous visit at this chipotle left me ,cheese Etc,sour cream,but there were several people in front of me who had yet to get their order finished (lettuce,Chipotle is a place I go to and expect to know exactly what I'm getting and what it will taste like,it just makes the whole thing taste as if it isn't as fresh,as it COULD/SHOULD taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5 stars for great fresh food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every single table was messy with stains and food,I watched employees step over an entire spilled burrito bowl on the floor for over 30 minutes,By far the filthiest chipotle I have ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I paid for a bag of chips they were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you really want chipotle,I am never coming back to this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this location is in the mall food court,i got a chicken burrito however I asked them to put it in a bowl,They put more than enough rice as I've been to other chipotle ,They got the bowl put the tortilla in it then the white rice ,and they skimp on the rice ,The rice had the lime,Thought they were going to wrap it then put it in the bowl they did not,and chicken,I got the tomato salsa corn lettuce ,and sour cream with the open,flavor that you can taste as other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is big lineup to order the food,- I am big fan of Mexican spicy food however,food is not spicy at all,- Burrito is filled with rice,- Price steep,beans,cheese or sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delicious food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just a fyi I've seen these nasty people pick food up off the counter ,Tonight my burrito was half,I told the guy there was way too much cheese and guess what he does- picks up the cheese off my burrito ,I'd rather drive to Braintree plaza to get a burrito then bother with this place again, rice,a tiny bit of chicken,and half cheese,and tosses it back in the bin if cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and tastey food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If I could give negative  stars I would my pregnant  girlfriend  wanted chipotle  so bad,and literally there was hardly any rice in her bowl ,and the chicken  was gummy  for some reason not only that she found a bone in the chicken definitely  will not ever be going back so upset,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh, and the price is similar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was tasty, Out of all the chipotle sauces on the tables,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the gloves that are touching the food are dirty,counters are dirty with smashed food all over the place,I ordered a salad ,and they wait until I'm at the register to pay to tell me they didn't have salad dressing,Why wouldn't you tell me that when I asked for the salad rather than at the end,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they place the food by the alphabet so ,when someone looks for their order they didn't find it because whoever put the food there placed them on the wrong,This is my go to chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Line up at a food place in a mall,Line ups are everywhere and will definitely occur at a venue that offers yummy food for a good,mixed rice,they found out that I was volunteering earlier in the day at a baby salmon fish release at Eagle Creek and they gave me my bowl on the house ,black beans,half steak half barbacoa,Positive Karma and good vibes taste so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-- never got a refund they just offered to make me more food,bugs in their lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It's a chain burrito joint, You order and then watch as they pass your order along a conveyor belt as you shout the ingredients off that you want and they slap the choices into your burrito (or taco, I'd go back and stick to the usual chicken burrito (no rice,bowl) you get the point,black beans,salsa ,salad, Chipotle's ingredients are definitely on the fresher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was DISGUSTING,She had the audacity to be rude and unprofessional and argumentative after I explained to her the issue on how disgusting the food was,Hazel told me that they cannot remake my food since they already issued me a refund ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was nothing to phone home about,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How do they forget 2 different burritos,Worst chipotle around,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I'm in food service ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's a cool option to do half chicken ,or half of any meat option that you want (just a tip,and half steak,I chose one without cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We get home and there's no guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I live about 5 mins from this location and my girlfriend and I ordered food for delivery,once the food got to us,the meat was cold in the bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And their burrito bowl from a taste perspective doesn't differentiate itself from ANY OTHER Mexican chain,Any mexican place that CHARGES for chips and then turns around and CHARGES for salsa is a no in my book,40 for a tiny bag of chips I don't expect to pay for salsa,not guacamole, Chipotle may be trendy because of the sourcing of its ingredients , Because the taste is the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I guess people like eating low quality ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chips are a bit stale,The salad I ordered contained no lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Come here all the time today instead of the bowl I had two tacos they were great,but the bowl is my most favorite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today they were out of sour cream ,and lettuce,Your money at the Delaware location will get you terrible customer service and ingredients that look old,Portions are less than adequate and they are always out of a major ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My stomach tells me it's either Saturday or Sunday when it injects an image of a bulbous burrito into my mind,and I recite the prayer: Chicken burrito,The burrito wrap doesn't fight,and I go for the burrito again,brown rice,I nod my head and mouth 'black' as I stare at the chicken ,black beans please,They always ask a second time if I want black or pinto beans,cheese (no sour cream) and the corn salsa,I ingest real meat here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can order your food at 12pm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And there was a chunk of chicken in both the queso and our tofu burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I come here at least once a week and usually get a chicken bowl with all of the salsas,The chips are amazing,sour cream and cheese,Seriously delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was hardly any lettuce or carnitas - the majority of it consisted of cheese,sour cream,It tasted like spoonfuls of sour cream ,Ordered a salad online from Chipotle today ,can't put together a decent salad,It tasted like spoonfuls of  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The meat in my sons meal was about half the normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The line to pick up food is almost always longer than the line to order food,I waited 40 minutes to pick up my food one day,I realized this area is a busy one with limited food choices around so today I ordered my bowl online again,I don't eat meat and to my surprised I opened my bowl to EXTRA chicken and no rice (,when I asked for extra rice),How am I even to attempt to pick around extra chicken,As I was eating the quac that I could on the top with some chips I had found in my office I came across the outside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a lot of food missing,Iv worked in food industry before,you should know how popular you are and make sure you have plenty of food ready,I had three people make my bowl because they seemed all confused,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go to chipotle almost everyday,For my order to go and they didn't not put lids on my bowls,The end of line I asked for lids for my two bowls ,When they finally got the lisa she started checking others out and wouldn't give me my bowls,When I said yes please she opened the bag and threw both bowls in there ,My bowl on top turned upside,and guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank goodness I look at my food for every bite I tAke,I always get chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good Chipotle location and good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food looked like it was from lunch all built up on the sides,my order of food was cold,my wife's food kind of warm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came for a burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
friendly workers and reasonable prices,the undercooked rice made us sick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle ,but the workers here had a bad attitude and gave us absolutely no rice lmao,Our bowls looked like sloppy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once I received my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excellent customer service and food,this is my favorite chipotle location the staff is very polite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was as good,floors scattered with food debris,and gross floors and food prep,and very much looking forward to the quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this location is pretty consistent and preordering usually comes pretty quick however this time my order was completely off from leaving out 3-4 ingredients to even giving me the wrong type of rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love chipotle ,a side of guac and chips,puts cheese ,so then they proceeded to put more cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The people working were nice and friendly but the food was so generic,I ordered a chicken burrito ,and steak burrito,The burrito came with brown/white, rice,beans ,and not even any refried beans,salsa,the lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food isn't cooked like the others,make the drive to a different chipotle location,doesn't taste the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
waiting 30 extra minutes for food is fine,I have been sitting waiting for my food for over an hour,There were over 25 people in the store waiting for their food,Not mad just disappointed  I will continue to wait for my food as the only, way to cancel it is to open a case with chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Of all days chipotle wants to be a plum,If I wanted bland rice ,Whoever made this batch of rice really screwed up because there was absolutely no cilantro ,and no lime just plain unseasoned white rice,and chicken I could've made this at home,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 stars because I found plastic in my food,their food is very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best chipotle service I've ever had,I asked for a salad bowl and they asked me if I wanted rice ,I was pretty satisfied with service at this location and will come back here next time I crave their chicken bowl,and beans on top of my lettuce,I enjoyed the fact that they gave me a lot of lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very busy so but still not an excuse for poor quality food,Worst burrito ever,This has got to be the worst chipotle location I have ever been to,The rice ,the chicken quality was LOW,and beans were undercooked,The place is usually full of highschool kids in their sports uniforms so I'm sure they don't really pay attention to the quality/uncleanliness ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They skimp hard on the rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Literally waited for over an hour Ordered my food at 5:40 ,after finally arriving home with my food,almost everything I ordered wasn't in my chipotle bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered first and my order is super simple because of food allergies,But after I ate all of my food I was left still hungry,When I asked for extra white rice the woman who was making my burrito bowl stopped,I love chipotle,I got a bowl with extra white rice,turned around to ask the guy prepping more white rice ,I'm not sure what the protocol is but I am pretty sure that they could've given be more rice ,If I was getting everything on my bowl that they offer and ask for more rice, because they couldn't accommodate a little bit more rice,I probably will come back - earlier in the day when I will be allowed to get extra rice,My bowl looked like it was child,black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is how a typical order goes: burrito bowl, White or brown rice, Black or pinto beans,medium or hot salsa, What kind of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had already brought my food home before I realized that it was not my order,I ordered 2 burrito bowls online for pickup ,You can't go wrong with chipotle ,the 2 bowls inside the bag were not mine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food was fresh,Plenty of food to go around,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How ever I do enjoy their guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Barely any meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Over priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Line to the back of the store for pick-ups while employees just stood around panicking that they run out of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't have all of the food out ,and even when i asked for more didn't go get any & i found TWO hairs in my food along with whole,The food is tasteless,also the man handling my food was sweating insanely bad,which isn't his fault but also alarming while leaning over all of the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but their food gave me a literal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like that the line moves pretty quick and I can get my burrito right away,I love chipotle,My order is typically pretty simple as I only get white rice,chicken,black beans,I will occasionally get guacamole if I am feeling extra,and cheese,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My fiancee and I both got burritos with a large,The burritos,Definitely looks different from any other chipotle that I've been too before,bag of chips to go,If we didn't get the chips,There was a rich cheese flavor with a surprising,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the worker slipped her hand and my burrito slipped onto the counter,and all she added back was cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The two burritos I ordered were horribly wrapped,also the rice in my burrito was super,My latest experience at this chipotle was awful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst service of any chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They literally give you the tiniest proportion or meat ,and soggy wet ass lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I cannot believe how poorly managed this chipotle is,I swore I'd never step into this chipotle again after the HORRENDOUS opportunities I've given,unlucky for me I ordered on-line to the wrong chipotle,I love chipotle,I'm done with chipotle because of this one location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good quality was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food with simple,It's very clear that many of the other reviewers have never worked in the food service business,I recommend the burrito bowl,you get a lot for under 10$ and unlike a burrito you can save it for later,It's more than making burritos,when most of the time they don't know how to order at chipotle,Highly recommend chipotle ,ingredients for an affordable price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And I could get more meat on a 99cent taco at Taco Bell then I can here,Worst chipotle I have ever been to,They didn't put in any rice,They skimped hard on the cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the manager was in store today and gave excellent service along with making sure all of us were content with our food ,And my fifth star is just because the food came out amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chips and the kids food,This time I get home and my burrito has no meat ,They gave her a bowl instead of burrito,and they eff up my effing burrito,Burrito only had rice,and no beans,and a pound of sour cream,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We were not charged accurately nor given all of the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the staff are rude and wrap the burritos horri,there's always cheese i,n the guac and when i ask them to get the part of the guac without cheese they seem irritated as if the cheese is supposed to be there in the first,they're also extremely messy and get ingredients mixed up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We love chipotle ,Told us there is an extra charge for rice which no other,They were rude and this includes the manager who wanted to charge me for chips even though I had paid for them and couldn't find after the side of black beans they gave me opened ,This was after giving me a hard time about getting the beans ,No apology for the spilled beans - simply told me I would have to pay for the chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My son caught food poisoning from this restaurant,This is the 2nd time one of my family members gets food poisoning from this location,I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UCF is way nicer and faster ill be willing to drive 15 minutes to consume food from that location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
especially considering it's a PR campaign to bring people back to Chipotle after having multiple foodborne,if you want 6 orders of meat in a bowl,I explained that a side order would not be included in the bowl,it would have to be outside the bowl to be considered a side,since the bowl contained all of the meats it is not in any way a side order,as this is not a franchise- the individual stores are not directly affected by having extra meats in a bowl,so I have used a couple before this coupon and have not had any issue getting 3-4 servings of meat ,there's a limit of two meats ,and the other meats will be sides ,""" I informed her that she's incorrect and that the coupon has worked for more than 2 meats before",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Second time called same girl this time asked for the manager waited 5 minutes someone picks up then hangs up never getting to explain anything to them and with this online ordering I find it kind of fucked up that we are keeping them in business by ordering online and they can not even follow a list of what to put it in your bowl ,Ordered online through Grubhub and they forgot ingredients that I had ordered point is I called twice first left on hold from a woman for about 15 minutes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some of the worst sweet tea i've ever tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Portions are huge but I guess that's just every chipotle lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got home when I go to open the bag the burrito was missing so right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the past I've gotten skimpy portion sizes (when they're too lazy to go in the back and replace the food,food poisoning (on multiple,bones in food,I ordered my usual bowl ,stale/burnt chips,and drink with a of bag of chips ,When I reached into the bag I pulled out a cup of half eaten guacamole with barely any chips,The cashier had to ask multiple times for someone to get me a bag of chips ,I got my replacement which was a mere handful of chips,brown guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I agreed to get a Chipotle bowl,My bowl was so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle had such a rude,I wouldn't suggest going to this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted off the most recent,(Yes I got a salad at chipotle,The salad they offer on the menu looks nothing like what they serve,It looked and tasted less Ttanning fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe skip chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not to mention when they ask you for here or to go when you say here they just give you your food without any basket to put it in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have severe food allergies ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chips are consistently salty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the food is still pretty good,and I received the last of the corn salsa from the bottom of the container,they were out of steak,you need to have ALL of your ingredients available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never had a good experience at this chipotle :/ My bowl/burrito has always been half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know to order through the app because it's faster and I can walk up and grab my food ,I go in a few minutes after the promised time for my food to be ready,I watched others come in to grab their food that had later promised times than mine ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chicken usually has some weird,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their meat selections are always fresh,unlike some other locations where their guacamole has that funky smell ,and taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My mother placed an order through their online delivery for a burrito bowl ,To top everything  off my burrito  was sloppy,If I wanted a wrap I'd order a wrap I stead of a hot or warm burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food always taste fresh,I know Chipotle has been taking a lot of flack and has been having issues with food safety ,& delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Probably the worst experience I have ever had in a chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was actually terrible,I ordered a carne asada bowl with brown rice,90% brown rice ,Seemed like they ran out of a lot of things so they masked it with mostly rice,I didn't pay $11 for rice,black beans,I received REGULAR steak,Rice and steak was extremely dry,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is ok,but way too overpriced,For that price,mediocre tasting one that came in a plastic bowl,After adding guacamole,my salad came to almost $10,I could have ordered a huge Mexican-style salad at a sit down restaurant with waiter service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This person put a little of food so i,he was in a rush doing my food ,Man whatever it's just food ,and jt all cost me 14$ and it wasn't even full bowl it was halfway ,asked for extra and he still put like 4 pieces of steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She was aggressive while putting the food in the bowl ,She was very rude and that is extremely uncommon whenever I come to any chipotle,I do not recommend this chipotle,when it was our turn we got two bowls,She just gave me dirty looks as I was telling her what I would like in my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We love Chipoltle food,the chicken meat in one of our burritos was cold,their quality ,but this store needs to figure out better management and do some serious quality improvement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Definitely will head down 23 to the other chipotle bc this one is awful,Undercooked chicken with absolutely no flavor ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a chicken bowl,showed the manager and was asked if I want another bowl with another protein instead,is they didn't discard the tray of chicken were the raw,chicken was ,and continued serving potentially contaminated chicken to customers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some employees serve more food than others,My only complaint is that I've had a couple of burrito bowls from here that had much less food than is expected,I've been to this chipotle a couple of times ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is uninspired, The staff were pretty much as underwhelming as the food,way overpriced,the globs of cheese ,and sour cream don't really support that format,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I did call and while they were willing to make me a new bowl correctly for free,forgot another ingredient,The employee who made it that day was careless and there needs to be more training and quality control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Come here all the time today instead of the bowl I had two tacos they were great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a burrito from here today ,if you're going to charge $10 for a burrito at least make it edible,and the guacamole was brown ,and the steak was uncooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its good food,Its a chipotle,Problem is their portions are the SMALLEST I have ever seen from a chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
room temperature food served, With all the fire that Chipotle has come under in recent years about questionable food h, It is clear there is a lack of basic standards  and oversight where quality control is concerned,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consistently delicious chicken burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get my food ,Love coming to chipotle,Usually when I go to chipotle,Her bubbly personality made my day and truly made me want to go back to chipotle again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will stop coming to chipotle for good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I live chipotle but they need to teach the employees how to roll a burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I'm guessing it's mobile ordering as many people came in to pick up their bags of food, I also ordered some chips as some crunch goes a long way when eating Mexican food, I chose to go all in and got the sofritos bowl , This was my first time not getting cheese and sour cream on the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito is always soggy,The only thing I could taste was the rice,and rice barely has a flavour,I used to get Chipotle all the time at metrotown and it was delicious,I don't know if it's just the location and the workers or if my taste buds have changed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today I ordered a burrito bowl,I ordered a Carne Asada bowl ,but they put regular steak in it instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was by Metrotown and craving Mexican food,Then just head straight for the cashier who will have your food waiting to go,The food itself was meh,However - the food itself left much to be desired,my hard taco shell was soggy ( which I HATE ) the guacamole was bl,The carnitas and chicken both were not tasty,The chips were stale,It didn't taste like authentic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is the the worst excuse for a restaurant I have ever been to,How do you have chipotle without those ingredients,Tonight when I went they were out of both kinds of rice,The rice was going to take 20 minutes ,chicken,and the chicken was going to take another 10,Typically the problem is involving being out of one of the main ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ladies working at the food order line we're having a contest to see if they can make each customer interaction (order) faster than the last,My food was compromised because they didn't even look at the servings as they put them in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here was OK,Your food is made to order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then you have to tell them that give you more rice ,Having a very long line waiting for someone to cook chicken,They are still cooking chicken,and beans,It is sad when they don't realize that they need to cook up more meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I frequent 4 chipotles ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they can't put all the food in an order why should I expect things like napkins,but will continue to visit every other chipotle location until corporate,Today they forgot two bags of chips , The non-masked employee just looked at me like I had two heads (without two chips)  He really did just stare at me till the manager said,"""Give him two bags of chips",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But this chipotle is so bad,that we drive all the way to the one on colonial drive when we're craving chipotle,they are out of hot and medium salsas,I work around the corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chain is pretty standard and consistency in their food,They seem to have ethical care behind their food which I think is great,Their burritos are huge,cilantro rice (they also have plain),I usually order the salad bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a shredded beef bowl ($10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito maker seemed just as confused,making the burrito as I was ,My burrito which was essentially a tortilla cover meatball was decent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and at least the food is assembled,Once your food is ready,The food itself is usually on par with other,This chipotle is by far the worst location I've ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First off they charge an extra $2 just to get that cauliflower rice,they only give you a small amount and then tell you they are going to charge you an additional $2 if you get any extra even though you can get extra rice for free,Not to mention the fact that for $22 the bowls were so small,I got maybe a quarter of a cup of guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
.food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bowl looked like the food was just thrown together in a rush, Tried to find a reason as to why I should eat the food delivered ,I paid $20 for food I could not eat,I placed an order at Chipotle in Waterford lakes after being told the chicken was in chunks,what I received was shredded chicken,was of poor quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On top of that they text while making your food,And then proceed to touch your food after,Their food taste bl,The worst chipotle I've ever been to,and compared to the other chipotles around,There is always 1 cook making the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Corporate chipotle please save this location,Bought a bag of chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's not even real Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's amazing how consistently gross the food is,guacamole is always brown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I come all the time to this specific chipotle,Mind you I called right when I placed my order because I wanted my cheese on the side for one of my bowls ,And when I arrive they are making my bowls with the bar minimum stuff they have still ,and they go ahead and put cheese on my bowl ,I understand that they were closing and running low on things but when I arrive they tell me they don't have any steak and barley any chicken,He did not tell me on the phone about how they have no steak or low on chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Done it a few times the last several weeks and every time my food comes out 15-20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my food was one of the best I've ever had,Manager: Whoever was making the burritos  ,and bowls tonight did an excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The employees were more concerned with leaving early than making food,Came in on Sunday night to get dinner after work and they had no shrimp and no rice,Apparently they had burned all of the rice ,"There was no offer to make anything else other than ""oh you don't want it without rice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However my burrito was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then I finally got my food ,DISGUSTING and the food looks AWFU,They were out of at least 4 things including corn and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came here with my best friend and her family to get some food to go,I hate that food got wasted ,My friend came here once before and didn't enjoy her food,The food was okay,But it is absolutely ridiculous to move like my bowl is going to explode if you don't hurry up,Someone came up and asked what kind of meat I wanted in my bowl- I asked for half barbacoa ,I had to tell them that's not what I asked for- so the bowl that was prepared had to be thrown away,And she put carnitas and chicken,but the meat was so off from what I asked for,The barbacoa wasn't shredded enough so it was kind of a lump of meat,and half steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but sometimes I crave their food ,I like using the mobile app to customize my burrito bowl,My bowl is usually on point ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After battling with online ordering - don't even get me started about why you can't order a quesadilla online - went to pick up our food ,from home I ordered some chips ,they forgot the lime/salt on the chips ,the free guacamole didn't get on the order ,and when my husband asked about it was told - in no uncertain terms - there was no way he could get the guacamole unless he placed an order for it,if it was me behind that counter and a customer had asked a few times how to get the guacamole,and that carne asada is kinda bland and tasteless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have never been able to order guacamole at this location,If you're a fan of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you want food poisoning then you're gonna want to eat at ANY chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the 3rd time I have gotten raw chicken from 23 Delaware location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of the food was a great,We even opened our bag when we got home and they put the salsa in that we ordered with out chips free,Came to this Chipotle and they were out of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food itself just really isn't that great,come on mannnn) and lack of spice in the chicken of my $9 burrito,I was turned off by the steep price for a side of uninspiring,either that or I am not creative enough to put the right combination of ingredients together to walk away with a urgency to return someday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They make people wait out in the cold for their food,The food is quite good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just want my order and food prepared,it will be a better experience and probably better food than this Chipotle,Before I get into what I actually think of this chipotle,they forgot my son's fruit and milk in the kids meal and mixed up salsa on our bowls with hot, The normal inconvenience of a smaller bag than the bowls ,and the bowls leaking through the carry out bag onto the car floor was as always, When we get our meals home we open to find that our bowls were made differently as the meat was on top of everything else ,and there was hardly any on the bowls compared to a normal, salsa, The chips we got were greasy, and stale and my wife found the avocado stem in the guacamole,missing items and the quality of the ingredients were sub-par,(I would prefer to get what I order with the quality like any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am dissatisfied because the quality of my food ,The employees were as medicore as the food,My rice was bl,and with no flavor I could tell the rice was old,My chicken had no flavor it tasted like unseasoned,chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Left over food on tables that's crusted to the tables because it's been sitting there so long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Or do they just slap random shit into a bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is amazing,give attitude every time asked to put something else on the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Take them out of the food before you prepare ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Originally wanted to order some soft chicken tacos ,but they only had the hard shell tacos available,Ended up getting the hard shell tacos,Tasted just like chipotle,If you are ever craving chipotle just head to metrotown ,Also ordered the guac and tortilla chips tasted as usual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe even the worst fast-food establishment I've ever been too in general,"approximately 6'6"" was clearly waiting for his food from a call-ahead",This is hands down the worst chipotle establishment I have been to in my life,they were out of rice,We waited 10 minutes for the rice to come out as the line grew to ~15,I asked for white rice ,I then asked for pinto beans in which he loaded on black,beans,I bit my tongue even as he then proceeded to add pinto beans,I got to the register and asked for chips,they had no chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They charged my friend for guacamole ,The lady at the back was super rude and rolled her eyes when I asked her for extra cheese after she had put less than they normally do on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito was fat,My bowl had everything I asked for with a good,still tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Literally the worst chipotle I've ever gone to,Made an online order and had a coworker pick it up & the order was made incorrectly and the bowl was almost empty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There were about 6 other people waiting to pick up their food in the same,I didn't get my food until 3:00 PM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My manager didn't check the food because the bag was sealed ,White rice bowl with chicken ,salsa ,and steak,sour cream,romaine lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tasted like crap for Mexican food,Line up not worth the food,Ordered a vegetarian burrito ,Pretty sure the beans are made in a meat flavouring of some kind,and it tasted like meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why waste food,Chipotle needs to figure out how to correctly size out their burrito bowls,Why remake a burrito bowl that you know you are scrimping on,Figure out how to properly proportion and weigh your burrito ,My bowl wasn't fully filled,So I asked her if she could fill up the bowl a little,So I asked her again if she could fill the bowl where she put her hand,and bowls so it's fair,and don't charge me for 3/4 of a bowl,Then looked at me and put lettuce on it to cover it up,And teach your workers that if they see a defect in the quality TO FIX IT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited 30 mins after I ordered my food (BOWL & CHIPS & GUACAMOLE) through DoorDash then received the WRONG NAME / ITEMS ,and had to wait another 45 mins to have chipotle correct the order,Very disappointed because I generally love chipotle,my Bowl looked like someone just plopped all the ingredients out of a can and threw it in a bowl,the chips were so stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just got a burrito with corn salsa that was FROZEN,the clerk wrapped my burrito like they were an overweight,the burrito exploded after my 8th bite leaving me fuming,the opportunity to slam dunk my burrito remains into the trash can was at least mildly cathartic, Not only that - I ordered double chicken,affirming understanding and then proceeded to NOT give me double chicken, And the sour cream was nearly frozen,the quality at this Chipotle is horrendous, I've eaten here probably 20 times (due to its proximity to work) and the quality always sucks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They never make sure they Uber drivers get the right meal and the food there is disgusting I always end up getting the wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not really going to write a review of the food at Chipotle because it's the same,The one thing I will say about Chipotle's food is that it's consistent,"You'd be amazed at how well behaved he is when we pull out that ""side of Chipotle chicken pieces"" that we order just for him",It always tastes the same,In terms of getting something that tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been to many chipotle's and this one is by far the worst when I got in there it was pretty slow no one one line but a worker grabbing some food the employees were talking ,They came and served me and the lady with glasses give me half spoon servings and when I asked for sour cream she said it was no more mind you it's was 2 hours before they close,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tried the new carne asado bowl,the meat was flavorful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
) which consists of: extra meat (for extra fee) and extra rice,They have NOT put any extra meat OR rice whatsoever,Today I ordered a bag of chips ($1,45) and I literally got 15 chips,45 for 15 freakin chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my Tex-Mex food of choice,So I tried the *cafeteria system* soft tacos,For no-brainer crispy tacos,Overpriced franchise $8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
done with chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After another 15 minutes of standing there I asked for them to just make my food ,but the fact that they lost my ALREADY PAID FOR order and took over an hour and 15 minutes to give me my food is ridiculous,but the last time I went to this chipotle was the worst ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chips ,sour cream,About to order and Chelsea informed me they were out of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Messy burrito that's unevenly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was surprised to not find any hair in my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We wanted to try the new cauliflower rice: don't bother getting it at this location,They gave us 1/2 spoon size portion of the cauliflower rice ,I asked why there's a $2 upcharge for cauliflower rice ,when they giving 1/4 of the amount they'd give if asked for white rice,When I showed him the advertised photos of the cauliflower bowl showing a hefty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At best the food is tolerable,Pretty sure I prefer Taco Bell (across the street) to this abortion of Mexican food,I swear the only seasoning anything receives is the variants of salsa,The crema has zero taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
White riceをベースとした、チキンにしました。,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but as many may know quality can vary greatly between them all  (I've been driving about 15 minutes out of my way to go to one that I like lately) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food isn't even ready,the food wasn't even made yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And my husband gets double wrapped burritos so they AREN'T a mess,This is the messiest mess of a burrito I've ever seen,Worked a 12 hr shift and all I wanted was some door dash chipotle,Got a bowl and the rice ISN'T COOKED,Try eating a rice based meal with crunchy,dry rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is NEVER fresh,Every time I go there the food is cold,always covered in old food as if they never clean ,I absolutely love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has a good price point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
heard them making sexual references with each other as my girlfriend and I were being served our food,Chipotle food will always be amazing though,no cilantro for the rice,or a meat missing,no steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had to come home and add salt and lime to the rice and the flavor of the burrito bowl was restored,I love me some chipotle,and both times the rice was completely unseasoned,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chipotle is normally not this bad,or cheese or whatever- but no sign so you find out as your bowl is already being made,After waiting forever I finally got my bowl ,I've gone numerous times to this location just to get to the end of the line and there was no sour cream,and there were so many hard pieces like uncooked corn oh ,and a whole avocado shell in my salad too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Waited half an hour past my time meanwhile I watched people go in order and walk out with food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
) I thought the chipotle near my house was bad,They also barely put any rice or meat in my bowl ,There was more sour cream than every other ingredient combined in my bowl,they ran out of the corn salsa,The employee also dumped on a massive heaping of sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The girl with the long black and red twists was wiping the counter (where the food is)  with a rag that looked like it hadn't been rinsed in a while,I go in cause I'm working Postmates and I decide to get a burrito for myself to go,Wel then she starts using the rag to swipe the meat back into the containers to be served to an unsuspecting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I did contact chipotle via twitter ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food deeeelicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was gross,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is very disappointing,We have completely stopped going to this chipotle because the last,The staff usually seems frazzled and running out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's unsanitary having pieces of hair hanging out while making food for people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and my food looks extremely soupy,my order was supposed to be ready by 8 PM and the food wasn't ready,My experiences at this chipotle are hit or miss,The rice is barely cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other than that pretty good service and food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Then to top it off they put my food in my bag sideways,my food split the bag ,This chipotle is a joke, I eat chipotle 2-3,they were out of rice,barbacoa and chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When you asked them to repeat their burritobowlortaco cheeselettusesalsa hotmildmedium they got upset,Got home and the burrito had a 3 inch gap,The guy who started mine asked me what rice I said white,Doent spread out the rice either,After salsa she starts to wrap it up,I asked for lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been to 15 chipotles in the us ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is also a lot worse than any other,Not sure if being located in the Mall food court plays a major,every single employee building my burrito bowl made a mistake (forgot the to-go,the cashier asked if I had a veggie bowl,forgot I asked for chicken,The chicken is always over-salted,forgot I wanted the salsa on the side),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95 I can get so much food in a bowl,I ask for light salsa and beans since the juices can make it a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food has tasted so bland,I ordered SOFT carnita tacos,Give me hard tacos,Wouldn't minded as much if the tacos were not so bl,From the meats to the cheeses even the sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered online to pick up fist bowl was not much food at all ( even they give you the option in the app extra it got totally ignored) second,bowl was also a little more food ,but the sour cream on the side was even not half full and the bottom of the bowl was wet  I be really disappointed from this chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place is awesome every time I go in there they have great food good,customer Service they show you what you choose to get in your burrito,"bowl,taco",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For a company that started off being owned by McDonald's and then having some issues but their food over the years they've really grown into a very large,For me this is only a mediocre experience when it comes to having burritos ,I can tolerate them but I prefer most of the other quick-service burrito places around,I think the one bonus to this particular location is that there is a Baskin-Robbins right next door so you can get an ice cream to go with your burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the person handling the money (no gloves obviously) also touched the food right,So many other customers were coming in after me and getting their food,I came in for a simple burrito ,Seriously how long can it take to make a burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There were some six or seven employees serving fresh food to incoming customers ,Just chicken tacos,salsa,cheese,Finally they hand me my order at 7:45 and I rush home to find it is missing over half the ingredients (lettuce,corn) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This review is solely based on the food,always got a steak salad,Some of the steak pieces are good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They need to reconsider who they hire here and get better quality food,I also found plastic in my burrito,If i can give this chipotle negative,i LOVE chipotle,i ordered a pick up order of large chips and Guac along with a bowl with Guac,It was brown and hard and tasted awful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the worst experiences iv ever had at a chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I mobile ordered a burrito bowl with double,I got my bowl ,chicken,and it was half empty and had 4 pieces of chicken in it,double beans,and mostly beans,double cheese,a sprinkle of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They can't own up to fix their mistakes and I'm sitting with a cold bowl in front of me,My friend and I drove back while she finally got ahold of them and was on call and we got free bowls so I'll give them a star for that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Definitely the worst chipotle I have been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not sure how it takes 20 minutes every time I get food here,This is the slowest chipotle I'm the country,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I did not bring it up to anyone there as they had a hard enough time dealing with getting food out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great burritos beef ,and burritos,bowl, They have great salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my order was missing chips ,and guacamole and chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This man was presenting himself in a very unprofessional light and I'm wondering how didn't chipotle  make him a store manager ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been here quite a few times and never has the food been bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food , The chipotle team can be a little,however chipotle also has the convenience of having your meal on the go for those racing for some eats during a work break,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dependable food now,but when I'm paying these prices,  They make me think I'm bothering them because I need extra salsa or I have to ask them a question,with fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle needs help,completely incorrect bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the person who prepared our food had lesions all over their arms that looked like scabies (my child asked me about it in the car),Oh and my other child's cheese quesadilla looked like a deflated, soggy pancake with no cheese inside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most of them just staring into space while every table is dirty with food on them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location was clean and the food super,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
white rice, They are out of bowls (using plastic salad bowls),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered 3 soft shell chicken tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seemed like me asking for guac on my burrito caused them great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am so disappointed with it because I love chipotle ,My friend also found a bone in her bowl ,and he guacamole was super,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Got a chicken bowl with all the fixins I like , I promptly returned and watched the woman make my second bowl , The third bowl was so rushed,then proceeded to use those gloves to add lettuce and cheese to the bowl,the chicken was cold,the chicken was still cold,and messed up the ingredients from my list,she had a piece of paper with my ingredient list on it that she was carrying the whole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is good,next time I'm sharing a bowl with someone lol the kids menu is pretty good too lots of food for the, and fresh and the bowls are huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this chipotle location is terrible,I love me some chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the rice was cold,there was no cilantro in the rice,I was given about 5 bites of chicken for my entire bowl,and the medium salsa was significantly more spicey and overpowering than normal (I get the same bowl every time) that the entire,bowl was overpowered by it,it seemed like the line employees were given a directive to serve as little meat as possible,and were charged for double meat,but the ingredients were well below Chipotle's st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We order online frequently and the food is always ready,Great chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every step of the way - I asked for cilantro free rice,they almost gave me regular rice,One of the strangest customer service experiences I've ever had - the staff kept asking me what I wanted and then passing the bowl to someone else,and I asked for chicken about 5 times,I asked for black beans twice,they almost skipped the beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because of the fact Chipotle food is so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can't wait to try it burrito style next,I hate beans so she got me extra rice,The meat was so tender,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
inconsistent burrito sizes ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"click on the ""where's my food"" ",and you can watch how your driver won't pick up your food at this place until that aformentioned estimated,they will gladly send you coupons for more (ice cold) burritos,Food was always delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the food at Chipotle this is why I have this 2 stars ,The manager came back and they conversed  Spanish again and the lady went back to her table meanwhile the manager took her food order that was next,The guy finally bagged up by food ,She was rolling balls which were supposed to be burritos,They were ripping and she was going over to heat up another tortilla and double rolling each each burrito ,At the last girl which rolls burritos,As I approached the front I placed my order and said it slowly and patiently for each girl as my bowl ,I'm still waiting and see the manager come around the corner a different,and salad went down an assembly line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food has been fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However instead of just switching out the container they simply dumped the old sludge from the bottom of the first container on top of the fresh food,I then noticed that the counter in the back of them was full of old dirty stainless steel containers and also the prep counter was disgusting and had old food all over it,The area where they were preparing my food was really gross,They placed my food bags on the counter for me to pay ,and there was food ,I removed my bag off the food ,I went home and could not even eat my food as I could not get the photos out of my mind,I went through and ordered two burrito bowls ,and a burrito to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plenty of other places around to get the same type of food,Never ordered sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered salad bowl with chicken ,and I got pieces of raw chicken in my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today I decided to give it one more try and the chips were so unbelievably,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My boyfriend and I just stopped by here to grab a few burritos for lunch,My burrito was all rice,We threw both burritos away ,The chicken that was inside was full,The girl was just slapping ingredients into the tortillas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the just forgot the rice,added guacamole and salsa,the forgot the sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Whenever I get crunchy tacos,I always have them put the beans and rice in one bowl and the tacos in a separate,This is the first time I picked up tacos at the Cedar Hills store,They wouldn't let me have two bowls and wrapped the tacos in tin foil,When I got home the tacos had completely fallen apart , bowl,If your store can't afford to give an extra bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5 stars if I could because I do enjoy the food,I've been coming to this location since it opened up (I didn't want to keep going to Metrotown just to have chipotle) ,My hope is that chipotle,I would definitely add some cheese to tone down the spice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff or really nice and funny and they make me feel good when I ordered food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was cold,and the employees couldnt figure out how to wrap a burrito,instead of just starting over they kept dumping the contents of my overstuffed burrito onto a new,the absolute worst chipotle i have ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
picking at food in front of ,soda tasted funny,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(Online order via chipotle app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The steak and chicken was decent,so you can't really even tell what it tastes like after it's been drowned in salsa ,I like to get 2 different meats to change up the flavour,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered for delivery never got my food,Would not recommend getting food here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but instead you're supposed to get your food from the shelf,I don't see my food there,As for the food itself,I go to the chipotle website ,It's not the best user experience but I'm able to order my bowl,I thought you could never have too much cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I will not patron at your establishment until the food h,I had ordered 2 steak bowl yesterday,will you start charging for the paper bowl too,the lady had to get more paper bowls,empty the bowls then threw the bag away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After a harrowing trail run in the Middlesex Fells reservation Saturday afternoon my boyfriend suggested ""Let's try that burrito place you read about on Yelp that you want to try",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love mexican food (particularly burritos) ,The food here is decent,but you will get a quality burrito or burrito bowl for just under $10,or get both types of beans if it suits your fancy,Don't be afraid to combine the medium and hot salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle always seems to be out of something,or chips,It could be only 6pm and they have no guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food court area is very relaxing,19: This is my wife's favorite location for chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cashier is literally touching every freaking thing doesn't change gloves and has a nerve to touch my cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consistently good food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you're in the burnaby area and want a burrito,but better burritos ,First time going to chipotle ,I found them over priced for the size of the portions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My order is always the same: burrito bowl x2,chipotle has a system of one specific,1 brown rice/1,white rice,each time there was barely any rice,1 side order of quac (not on the bowl),the portion was half of the container and didn't even reach the top of the brown bowl,they also had one bowl with little,and the other bowl had literally 5 pieces of the shredded,How is it that one person is making two of the almost exact bowl end up having a product that doesn't even look alike,and both contains carnitas/sour cream/cheese/lettuce/corn/salsa, (but I'd take it) lettuce, lettuce,Food taste is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the service here is trash-- just like their food,They are super stingy with their scoops of rice ,I've had uncooked rice ,told me it went through but charged me regular price ,and corn in my bowls multiple,I paid $30 for two chicken bowls ,and chicken ,and chips,but overload on the cheese ,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came to this location while shopping and I specifically ordered a salad because I like the dressing,The girl on the line was rude and sloppy while building my salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I paid for my food ,I will never ever go to this chipotle ever again,Please go to a different chipotle,It always seems like when I go to this chipotle there is an issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They put the bowls in the bag without shutting the lids all of the way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered two burritos ,Got home and opened it up and there was literally a huge tear in the middle of my burrito,How can you not see this when wrapping the burrito,"just a torn and messy ""burrito"" my husb",and did not enjoy his chicken burrito,He had maybe 4 pieces of chicken in his chicken burrito,and chips and salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She said they would re-make it but the lady at the beginning of the food line just gave me a new,I work in food service ,I came in and ordered a burrito,But when I got the burrito it fell apart in my h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my burrito ended up In the trash,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice was pretty dry,She then informed me that they didn't have any steak ready,and then it would be 10 to 15 minutes for the next batch of steak to be ready,The meal also tasted subpar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe even the worst fast-food establishment I've ever been too in general,"approximately 6'6"" was clearly waiting for his food from a call-ahead",This is hands down the worst chipotle establishment I have been to in my life,they were out of rice,We waited 10 minutes for the rice to come out as the line grew to ~15,I asked for white rice ,I then asked for pinto beans in which he loaded on black,beans,I bit my tongue even as he then proceeded to add pinto beans,I got to the register and asked for chips,they had no chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a chicken bowl with guac (prior, Wife got her double-chicken ,plus enough chips to drain their current,it was always vegetarian because I couldn't tolerate the adobo seasoning of the meats, :)  My sister-in-law the vet got a double-steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The price is different,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food came fast ,but my friend got like 3 pieces of chicken in her bowl  by far the worst chipotle  we've ordered from,They were greedy with the cheese ,the queso tasted like it was sitting in all the pan all day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place constantly has subpar service from workers who cook the food horribly to the customer service ,Tonight visit - the person making my burrito couldn't have been more miserable,The burrito ended up ripped,I had to ask for a new burrito,it's not that hard to make a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were cleaning the food preparation areas with a dirty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not enough rice,too much liquid from the beans,They still have a little way to go to reach the quality I'm used to seeing from a Chipotl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food court area is very relaxing,The food court has about 50 percent of its restaurants open,We found quite a bit of cleaning going on at the reduced number of tables in the food court area,19: This is my wife's favorite location for chipotle,quality of product,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seems that over the last couple of years that they skimp on the quantity of food they serve,I'm not saying that I need a lot of food,I just received an order via Door Dash and it had 1/3 of the bowl empty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 But for some $10 tacos toss some meat on there jeez,I love Chipotle but this location can get very skimpy on the meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chefs were all chatting and not making fresh food ,and almost everything was nearly out so my burrito was a bunch of crusty,The store was packed and the steak and rice were really cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 very little food in the bowl,I picked up my burrito bowl (before taking the cover off) ,Even if you order double meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's crazy to me how out of all chipotles in Orl,ando this one has the worst cooking the rice is salty ,and stale and the steak is always beyond under cooked,everything taste so horrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Order we just picked up had 2 things incorrect and they left out a large bag of chips we paid for as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was flavorful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took me 41 minutes just to get to the front of the line to order my food (& no that's not over exaggerating,the food has always tasted great,You'll be waiting around 2 hours at home before you can pick up your food,sometimes they'll legit fill up your burrito bowl,or taco or burrito (whatever you ordered),they give you like 5 pieces of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
realized I had omitted rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle tends to have a line,Burrito bowl with brown rice,black beans,tomato salsa,I stopped getting the guacamole because of the added,steak ,cheese ,and lettuce,delicious every time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This should've made one hell of a burrito bowl,Requested a full portion of chicken and full portion of steak with brown rice,What I got was 5 grains of rice,It all fit in the bowl with room to spare,black beans,10 beans,corn salsa ,half the meat,cheese,a few shreds of cheese,sour cream,little guac and a little sour cream,and lettuce,10 strips of lettuce,12 kernels of corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Chipotle has provided sub par food on almost every order I have received,the chips are routinely stale,the guacamole I order with the chips is always brown,Normally it's still edible but I had to throw out my guacamole on my last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am rating it 3 stars due to their chips being stale,every single time I've gotten chips from there,My coworkers have also complained about the stale chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst customer service and food,When we returned home to eat our food,Possibly the food left over from the night before,but we will drive a bit further for quality food ,This is the closest chipotle location to our home,it was cold and tasteless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I found multiple pieces of hair in my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service was good but the food was too salty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Besides the authenticity of the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Does that look like a double rice and cheese burrito,I also don't understand how a burrito that small,I order with double rice ,hoping it will soak up some of the juice from the beans ,and salsa,and double cheese,I've been ordering via their delivery option and it continues to show that their quality is going downhill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What a great new food concept fast ,The choices of food will make you return several,Well price fast ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
be prepared to wait in a line for awhile to pick up your food,They make the food relatively fast,you get a pretty good amount of food for the price you pay,You can tell the food lacks sometimes from everyone in the back being hectic,just make sure you ask for a burrito underneath the bowl if you want one,The prices aren't too bad,The bowls are delicious,It's a nice location but personally too busy for my taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An area to keep the food warm,They have their own set of everything to make the burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kids meals were only partially cooked and missing several ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think it's really interesting how I'm in line right now with 6 people in front of me and I was able to write this entire review while I wait for the workers to very slowly and carefully scoop food into peoples bowls ,and burritos,They're so slow I can tell you that there's still 6 people in front of me and the guy ordered a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle was not the best,the music was so loud I couldn't hear my husband speaking to me across from the table and my bowl just tasted burnt which was weird,We ordered a side of queso with our chips , considering I didn't order any meat in mine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can't decide what's worst walking away or waiting on my food,don't even like chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Awesomely healthy food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Last week I was there and one employee walked up and down the food line distracting each employee separately with conversation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with only a few minutes left on my lunch break to scarf down this food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They need to step up the speed and make sure the customer service remains great as well food is pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered chicken salad, I was given half spoon of chicken,Only that much chicken,There is no lettuce at where you start the order,so the shortest working employee had to reach to the lady who was stand by the cashier to get lettuce ,and the lettuce is not fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got food poisoning from this place ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he had to wait for them to make taco shells,you continue to lower the bar one taco at a time,the guacamole was almost brown, and they put cheese on a salad that didn't call for cheese that was brought home for someone with a severe,they forgot the salad dressing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wow amazing this chipotle on parmer is much better than the chipotle,In fact this one tastes exactly the same as the chipotle in my home town in FL,"to try to lull people into a sense of ""hey I'm eating something healthy"" they blatantly post ""our chickens are feed a diet","free of animal bi products"" Wow thanks for going the extra mile and not feeding your chickens dead",I can really taste the difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When you're really feeling lots of food ,it's unnerving how fast your food moves down that line,They'll whip out your burrito bowl so fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I now order double rice ,and beans (no extra,The only thing that costs extra is meat ,Same taste as every other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quality is consistently the same as any other chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I told them I didn't need all of that food,"then give me the food""","but they told me that I was not ""allowed"" to leave with all the food",The app glitched and repeated the order so they made 3 burritos with my sons name,but paid 3 times the price,They made 3 bowls for me ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is very slow food,The sit-down Mexican place gets your food to you quicker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she stop making someone food -- went to the back for a few, minutes then came back and continued to build a burrito WITHOUT changing her gloves or washing her h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality isn't completely terrible,The employees are not careful about keeping the worktop clear of food,But the worst part is that they contaminate food because of their lack of sanitation,My husband is vegan - chipotle is one of the few, - when chicken still looks ,and tastes like chicken,there is cheese in the guacamole,but the employees here truly must not care about accidentally mixing cheese into their vegan guacamole,You can't trust this location to have a clean workstation and you can't trust that there isn't cheese in the guacamole - vegans beware,it's corporate's fault for thinking that it's a good idea to put cheese right next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They're always out of one food item or another,One day they didn't have a Sharpie to mark who's burritos are who's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank goodness this isn't my home chipotle - I'll never ever be back to this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the SLOWEST chipotle I have ever been to in my entire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do think that it would have been nice for them to offer a discount on my price as I had to order something I didn't love,and carnitas and I had to wait for them to get more lettuce for my salad,Since they did not have two of the main ingredients that I needed I had to choose an option that I typically would not get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are constantly running out of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
many fine Chipotle burritos ,I think one thing this particular location had going against it from the get go was the high bar set by the many other locations that really delivered a great experience and burrito,have perfected the art of burrito construction,and I went for my usual chicken burrito,"he quickly shoots back a scripted response of ""all steak is cooked medium-rare"" and doesn't even look up to make eye contact as he is wrapping up my burrito",We made it through the first round of choosing our rice ,"""what salsa do you want on it",adds the chili salsa ,and then proceeded to put on random salsa ,and meats,my wife asked to have the undercooked meat taken off her quesadilla ,she noticed that there was a neon pink piece of uncooked steak on the edge of her quesadilla,(I'm often accused of being a vampire for my preference of medium rare steak,"""can you please take that uncooked piece of steak off the side",I don't think you understood--my wife asked for one piece of really pink steak to be taken off her quesadilla ,Without even asking her what she DID want on it he makes her a new steak ,and cheese,and cheese she didn't even ask for,and cheese quesadilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is really bad - the guy making the burritos puts nothing on them - he just gives you scrap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We always like the food here however today's lunch was ruined prior to even eating,It's VERY unappetizing seeing this around my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the food is always delicious,Chipotle is chipotle,And there's one girl that serves the condiments on your bowl that barely puts anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worst chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let's start by saying I have been coming to this chipotle for about three years ,Except for the last couple times the employees have been extremely rude and they seem to always be out of rice,how is this an option when literally almost every dish here is made with rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight I ordered to-go and was expecting to pick up a chicken burrito ,A few days ago I ordered a chicken burrito ,and was give a burrito that was about 3/4 of the size of a normal,burrito i've eaten many,and was given a bowl instead with about 3 pieces of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff all seemed to be waiting for food to finish cooking,The area where the food sits was a complete,The food itself didn't taste like other,Nothing seemed fresh and the rice was way over-cooked,both the mild salsa ,and the guacamole had cheese in their containers, mess and several items were contaminated with other ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle employees are hands-down the worst burrito rollers I have ever encountered,This leaves you with a burrito that is more round than oblong,please learn from other Boston tex-mex burrito joints-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the girls is a vegetarian and found chicken in her burrito which grossed her out,Corn salsa wasn't as spicy as usual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love this chipotle,Everyone's who is anyone has experienced chipotle ,and since this chipotle is at a pretty busy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once the transaction is complete they don't offer a bag for your chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We grab food here reguarly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It's frustrating to get food here, They are generally out of some ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
juicy food ,I love chipotle,this restaurant has delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty good burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is terrible, I took the food back to the restaurant ,big mistake my partner found raw chicken in his bowl,I took pictures of the raw chicken just in case we get sick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hoping desperately that the food will be different,my guacamole tasted like someone forgot the salt,the lettuce was limp,my Chili-Corn Salsa tasted like it'd been sitting in a can for years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The chicken had a ton of fat in it, When asked for salsa she threw it in the bag, The sour cream looked like a watered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burrito bowl + salad dressing is the secret,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mediocre food,The food was messily put together,The guacamole was unfinished,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is never at the ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's chipotle so the food is never in question,I'll find another chipotle,An industrial mouse trap in the corner ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited for ONE person to make about 8 burritos in a row while about ten,"I said ""doesn't it bother you that you are the only one out here making burritos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 You can skip the line completely and just pick up your food,Another typical univeristy Chipotle that is in a prime location for college students to get a quick and reasonably priced lunch,brown rice ,and black beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 There shouldn't be a huge difference in variation of food, For some reason my brother got more food in his bowl than me ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We drive past 2 chipotle location to dine at the mill plain location because of the wonderful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very good wholesome food with a nice,pork and rice do not taste like fast food it is actually better than my home cooked version,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A good restaurant for a quick burrito,Be aware: the burritos are huge,I prefer the burrito bowls because they're easier to eat,Sometimes the meat isn't as cooked as I would like it though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is completely absurd for any chipotle,and hell that might be generous cause this chicken is dry,but I wasn't laughing when he sprayed the tortillas and lettuce too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The employees will let the meat get too low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get the bowl with steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5 stars enough said gets a little busy during lunch but well worth the wait can be a little spicy so be on the cautious side if your taste buds are wea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I used to order the burrito religiously,until someone turned me onto the burrito bowl,I always get guacamole on my burrito bowl,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burrito bowls (burrito,stuff w/o the tortilla) and salads (burrito stuff with lettuce,They also offer tacos, Deliciously different rice, More meat variety (chicken,I've only had the chicken ,only black and pinto beans -- eh, Lots of different salsa options,I like the pico-ish salsa ,and the corn salsa -- spicy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't come here if you don't want to get unfair amounts of food for what you pay for,From getting a full bowl my first,even though I asked for more and my friend who ordered before me got a FULL bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 stars for location and amount of food that will give ANYONE that freshmen 15 no matter what grade/age/profession you are,they have large burritos,Succulent meat in your mouth,but can ANYONE actually taste the flavor in the tortilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  Food quality is normally good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
locally owned burrito shops,i get a no-diary black bean / guac burrito,00 less or came with chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle was pretty good,I've eaten here 3 times and the second time the rice has seasoning that wasn't cup up enough ,and it was a bitter taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their staff is a bunch of high school kids who know nothing about customer service or food prep, No choice in taco types,No baha beans , They skimp on the meat big,It either corn or flour,Cabo Bobs you get MUCH more for your money and it tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food comes to me cold,This chipotle is a complete,Go to the other chipotle on Hamilton,and the rice is extremely hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
* Good food for the price,A fairly good burrito place that makes lunch happen in your belly,I'm updating this review over roughly 2 years ago as consistency and quality have gone up after several episodes with semi-cooked rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Chipotle food,I got my food to go,and another on salsas and other toppings that was spending more time chatting with customers than making food,"I don't expect to have to wait 40 minutes for ""fast"" food at 9pm at night",My food was good,There was one girl making the tortillas and meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" When working in the food ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The people working the food line are rude ,"They try to move ""so fast"" that they are sacrificing the quality of the food & service",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They don't give you enough food,You may get half a bowls this causes me to wonder are they taking food home ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The meat is always cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first associate was preparing burrito bowls ,The folks making the burritos can only go as fast as their managers ,It's hard to excuse basic things like the trash overflowing and them running out of chicken just because it's a busy,If someone's not watching the chicken it will run out,and asking for orders so quickly that sometimes they were 3-4 deep waiting for ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They REALLY skimp on meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One time they didn't put enough food in the bowl,I've been to this chipotle many,The staff are really friendly and my good is always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first time out of soft taco shells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This guy was acting like I was trying to cheat the system and get more food for less money or something which is not true,and rice) as allowed for a kids meal ,He was going to charge me for a full bowl because I wanted these toppings,and wanted a bit of cheese and salsa on top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at least the girl making my food was very apologetic,I came in to get a couple of burrito bowls,and I'm pretty sure she upped the amount of stuff in my bowl,I don't know if you forgot in the 30 seconds it took to ring up my bowls,and they were out of the pepper/onion mix that I prefer over the beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food was yummy and delicious as expected,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burritos are off the hook especially the steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Changed the tomato salsa, New recipe reminded me of salsa out of a jar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food is never spread out through the burrito,but everytime I order a burrito from this location it's never good,So one end will have hot items and the other end of the burrito may have the cold,It's never consistent with the burrito,I typically don't  have issues when I order the bowl, cheese ,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tacos not fixed properly ,My coworker and I were not satisfied with the meat temperature (literally freezing),I called to speak with a manager and Jeanelly rudely interrupted me to let me know my toppings is why my meat was cold,I explained to her that the inside of the meat was cold,My steak was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this location is beyond terrible with shorting customers food,My burrito was just as bad,The person behind me had ordered ordered chicken and there could not have been more than 7 chunks of meat on the burrito,I have been visiting chipotle for several,I will drive the extra 12 minutes one way to get to the high street location on the now few times I will be eating chipotle which I love,I have been a faithful customer for many many years and have at times had chipotle for lunch ,I always give chipotlr rave reviews and my friend hate how much I love chipotle,but if were to send someone to this location I don't think they would ever try chipotle again,I ordered a bowl for my wife ,and the bowl was only about half,And still it only took up half the bowl,this is after I asked to have them not skimp on the meat,I feel cheated on the meat,Also I had asked for extra fajita extra cheese ,and extra sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had lunch there today and ordered a burrito,It was one of the few times I've been there when the person wrapping the burrito actually knew what they were doing,I guess I was on my own to eat my burrito without spilling rice ,They are almost certain to be out of something when you go: rice,chicken,(15 minutes after they open) and they were out of chicken,beans,Today's missing item was black beans,and beans into my lap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatever your Mexican food taste buds desire,burrito,taco,So stop in for a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Two of those times my burrito bowls tasted nasty,and today's tastes, How can their taste be SO far off the other,locations' tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Love the food,Love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Expect that they will be out of many menu items (rice,chicken,beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they forgot out chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The corn is cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
making sure the proper amount of food is proportioned so it's not spilling out,Whoever is running the riverside location does a terrible job training their employees in how to roll a burrito,Every time I go in my burrito falls apart the minute I pick it up,If you can't roll a burrito up properly,you don't need to be making burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However the quality of my food,This is not the the quality and freshness that has become synonymous with the chipotle brand,the lettuce was wilted ,The guac was brown and tasted oily,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other then that the food is st,I've been to chipotles where in the middle of rush,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually get the fajita burrito with carnitas (pork),"i agree with the chipotle-loving group that i find on facebook: ""Usually ",hot red salsa,at times when i am not so stingy with my wallet i add a heaping scoop of guacamole into it,sour cream ,and lettuce,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came to chipotle because I was hungry,The lady already started off bad because she gave me the last of the chicken which was burnt ,Also the guy who did the toppings put way too much sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle has great food with quick,Love their tortillas and I always order them on the side with a barbacoa bowl,If I'm feeling rich I'll order some guacamole on top,because guacamole goes well with everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito roller very generously let me try it before I got it in my entire,burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's food service),""" I get you work in food service",I had to have a stare down with the lady making my burrito one day after going back ,I've been to just about every chipotle in the Columbus area,They speak in Spanish half the time while they're making your bowl ,Twice I've had to have my bowl remade because they've been too busy,speaking another language to each other and mistakenly put guac in the my bowl instead of mild,) and MY GOD are they stingy on everything they put on your bowl,  salsa,I asked for extra cheese,"Finally I snapped and said ""how about you keep putting cheese on there until I say stop",It's right around the corner from my house ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tasty food ,The food,because we need a little glass half full-- they put lots of meat and the extras in your bowl or burrito,If you get a burrito,Poor little chipotle,basically you get a foil bowl with a tortilla on top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
walk out and leave the food with them, They even skimp on the rice ,and beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the corn shells work well for tacos,-The rice has just enough cilantro in it to not offend if you're particular,-The chips are lackluster,-The guacamole is basic,-The corn is sweet,The trick is you have to try enough of the ingredients to know what you think will go well together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Forgot to put cheese on burrito ,She barely put any rice or meat in our bowl too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been served food in an aluminum cover wrapped in aluminum foil ,because they had no cardboard food containers,The food sucks,been treated rudely for asking for extra rice,or Reynoldsburg they are both much better quality everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On my burrito they literally put 3 pieces of steak,the burrito was so small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the worst part of my visit was unfortunately the food its self,After a long wait I had hoped for a decent Chipotle burrito,The steak was stringy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
customer service is always number 1 here I've seen them remake people's food many,but they are usually pretty good about powering through the line and getting people their food quickly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was still hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but if you go in the afternoon the chips are stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We also asked for a side of chips and salsa which they forgot to include ,and when reminded they just threw some random salsa(which the amount of salsa was also nowhere worth the amount paid,the chips were bigger than the container) I would not ever recommend this chipotl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They gave ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get turned off by the frowny faces of the staff and the fact that they all hangout behind the food talking ,not be so extreme (either serious or giggly) over the food mind you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great burritos ,and and they are also known for their burrito bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food has been on par,"but it makes you feel better knowing you're eating ""fresher"" food", You can also squeeze it over your food (e, Chipotle generally uses higher quality ingredients than the other burrito places ,The menu is simple: burritos,burrito bowls,My favorite thing to order is a chicken burrito bowl,If you order a burrito bowl to go, The burrito bowls heat up well in the microwave after being refrigerated,tacos,tacos) if you want, It starts with a bed of rice , I like the cilanto-lime white rice (it's great,these lids are useful if you don't finish your bowl ,marinated chicken goes on top,and beans, by itself) and black or pinto beans (whatever I'm in the mood for - I order black,beans more often),roasted chili-corn salsa,spicy salsa (red, Chipotle uses naturally raised meats (no antibiotics or hormones) , I sometimes add sour cream and/or guacamole (guac is extra,shredded cheese,and romaine lettuce,This Chipotle is located in the Publix shopping center at the corner of Howell Mill Rd,and salads, All of the ingredients are laid out before you so you can what's going into your meal, The result is a difference you can (sometimes) actually taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The person preparing our food waits until he gets to the proteins,I love the bowl sooooo much,Fairly short wait and well worth it once we finally got our chicken bowls,we would like chicken I say,we're all out of chicken,out of chicken, we wait for the chicken to come off the grill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 You would think all that goodness of food would taste good,I will get the chicken burrito ,I love love  love chipotle ,brown rice ,black beans,hot salsa ,cheese,and lettuce just because I'm fat,So I've been to this location a few times and it doesn't taste the same,And they taste amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a little pricey but for the amount of food i,Now chipotle is not the epitome of the burrito,i look to chipotle,Everyone says that they put too much rice ,but i love rice so it's great,but when i need to satisfy a craving for some fajita chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I am impressed as there are usually a lot of children and the floor never has old gross food on it,Though I got my food last,Their food is always fresh,This chipotle is always clean,Hot and tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but when I go out to pick up food for dinner,poor food ,I ordered a chicken quesadilla ,while the rest was unmelted cheese and cold chicken falling out of the floppy,and restaurant quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like the food ,This is by far the worst chipotle  I have ever had the pleasure of visitibg,but this store gives chipotle chain a bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not a big fan of chipotle , We are lil fatties when it comes to things like guacamole and chips or queso, When I opened her meal up it had wilted/rusted lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is not good,I found a fly in my chipotle bowl MOMENTS before I almost ate it,The rice ,and chicken are always hard ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food prep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They're not grilling steaks they're pouring ready made food into a container, what's it cost to make a freakin bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we beat the rush and our food was fast,The food is consistent,We ordered two steak burrito bowls - ,Meat (Steak or Chicken or Baracoa) with rice (brown ,and salsa/chiptle (corn or tomato or tomatillo) ,and sour cream and cheese ,and lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good: almost less busy than any other chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
customizable food with a conscience,You know they have brown rice now,delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But to the food:  The chicken bowl is my absolute,Just don't go when rush hour foodies are there,The veggie burrito is also good,They always load enough meat on there (2 scoops) and the chicken is always well seasoned,And I have only seen them run out of steak once,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a bowl and a burrito,The portions on the burrito were pitiful,find another chipotle,I ordered chips ,and guacamole and the girl at the register looked at me like I had ten heads when I stood there waiting for her to hand me the bag of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so if I want to get my bowl the way I like it I have to ask her like 4 times ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food was terrible,Worst chipotle ever, The steak was so chewy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This food os,DELISIOUS I Recommend The tacos but the burritos are great,AWSOME(especially the tacos),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I understand why Chipotle is looking at the food h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They don't have half the food on the menu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just wanted to say I have had food here several,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You get to watch these teenagers stumble through making burritos like they're asking a girl to homecoming,They over-stuff burritos to the point the tortilla breaks ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stale rice,Stale chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My chicken burrito bowl was just as good, as any other chipotle I had been to around the US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 As if Chipotle doesn't have enough health food violations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is my go-to location for savory giant burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The famous chipotle,It is good as it was chipotle,The only bad things about this chipotle here in this place was the service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but now i feel their quality of food has been down graded,This is the closest resemble of CA tacos, Their green sauce is almost replicate of my favorite taco place i,i stull think Chipotle is the best taco spot in Orl,i couldn't get enough of chipotle,i'm talking about their steak, In my opinion their steak used to be tender ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"More that"" the food is always great",Why does Chipotle continue to be cheap with their rice,"We were in line and most of the time i heard was ""more rice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And they will put it in a bowl for you,This probably has something to do with my mildly abnormal obsession with black beans ,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered 2 chicken burritos ,rice ,beans,and chips,My children love these chips my 2 year old,is so picky but the quesadilla and chips he will always eat,No chips for either child,So rather then the relaxing im calling to see about the chips,cheese quesadilla,If we had gotten pizza like we had originally considered and something like cheese bread was missing they would bring it out to you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we've only experienced one minor error on an order (chicken instead of beef on a burrito), Typical order for me lately is the burrito bowl with the grilled,brown rice,corn salsa,red chili salsa ,Sometimes guacamole, steak,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fifteen min and no food:(   walk -out) chick -filay Wass great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good and healthy  food ,I love chipotle ,I had chipotle bowl here multiple,reasonable price,We always go for chicken bowl , time and i had consistently tasted same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The employees were very friendly and the food was good,The wait was long because the process was not going in the smooth manner I had become accustomed to when visiting other chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When i walked in it started like every other chipotle experience with a line that took about 10 minutes,I know chipotle doesnt give much,I got my usual order and she loaded the rice down filling all the bowl , meat however i had mouthfuls of rice with no other,I start my order and ask for a bowl with a wrap in it ,and the lady taking the order rolled her eys and slammed down the bowl ,and only put about 10 pieces of chicken if that, ingredients in the bite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
under cooked food,cold chicken,the steak looked like it had been sitting out for a while,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is cold,  I always get crispy tacos,chips are stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so we know the food is delicious,I asked the lady if she put cheese on my burrito,wrong bowl (simple,mistake) i then got my bowl ,she said some words and slapped some guacamole in a cup ,Snatched the lid off and and yes there was cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And another thing why is it when I ask for a bowl they add a lil bit of rice ,Every time I come to this location they never have anything fresh guacamole is black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First time having a burrito at chipotle,It was good but i didn't realize that they put coriander in salsa sauce which i can't eat,I ate one with steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
different than anything I'd ever had but it added such a nice flavor to the chicken ,and black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Come on in and see the portions that are so inconsistent that you never know what you'll get and see the food spilled all over the counter to include sour, cream in the spicy salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food is still Chipotle delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
though from time to time this location is out of something required for a burrito (e,rice) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
please post something on your door to inform me next time you run out of an ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But those smiles seemed genuine and they rolled a mean burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and flat out get my order wrong when I order using the iPhone app (not just ""I said only a little rice",""" stuff-- they'll add cheese",forget sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fast-food restaurant,Last time ever eating at any chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the chicken was overly spicy, I usually get the carnitas but the rest of my family gets the chicken as it is supposed to be one of the least spicy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle never fails me and if it does they always make it right (usually) I used my buy one get one free coupon and got to enjoy my yummy Chipotle burrito bowl :) This location is always very fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(even though the food is fresh,I would look forward to the amazing hard tacos or a delicious burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The manager of course was REALLY nice and even gave me a card for a free burrito or bowl,Oh and like another poster said they are stingy with their rice,I mean they charge you 10-11 bucks for a bowl and only want to give you little rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Something is always wrong with the food,including over/undercooked rice,undercooked meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's generally a decent deal for good food,I got a burrito,I'm eatin on this here free burrito,since one of those burritos can be stretched to two meals,chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice,steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their food is always fresh,black beans are decent,they charge extra for their super shitty guacamole,steak actually has color,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great tasting food ,and a restaurant that seems to care about quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My bowl was awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The guy on the line started to dump pico on my bowl before I even asked,And why do you only spoon out 6 pieces of chicken on a bowl ,I'd like my bowl to be remade,""" I've completely stopped ordering from this location via the app because I know my bowl will be salsa soup ",but you DUMP half a pound of salsa on it,"Even though I write in special instructions ""please go light on the salsa","'"" I love cheese just as much",Chipotle is so delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
soggy burrito,Long lines to get said burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food however was awesomely good,I ordered a burrito bowl with pork in it,the burrito bowl was full,I also ordered some chips and Tomatillo- green chilli salsa,the salsa had a zip ,I found my self eating the whole bag long after the salsa was gone,the chips had a nice, salty taste to them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They don't seem to run out of food nearly as much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle experience ever,Neither the beans or the rice had any flavor,The meat was mediocre,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's truly the McDonald's of the burrito world,The rice is blah,If you need something quick and potentially healthy for a decent price,but do not expect for your taste buds to get excited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really great food at a decent,price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We drive past 2 chipotle location to dine at the mill plain location because of the wonderful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They had all the food in stock ,The food was fresh,I enjoy this chipotle ,On this visit I got 3 bowls during dinner rush so there was a line,The bowls were full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then you have the young lady that comes from the back and wipes all the trash from around the heated food to the floor or into the container,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went there to pickup a burrito for me,I take a couple of bites into my burrito ,The girl who answered said they would replace my burrito,Go back and get a burrito with the same,and tacos for the wife,Why would I want it replaced after I found a hair cooked in the meat, batch of meat,What ticks me off is that they didn't even say they would toss out the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ok food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
below average food,Had to have the burrito rewrapped,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the quality of the food is comparable,especially when it comes to the meat, My biggest problem is that this Chipotle in particular uses less ingredients than all the other,but I do not appreciate how they always skimp on the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basic stuff like white rice or chicken),once the chicken is low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your topping station worker randomly walking to the back kitchen for 90 sec while your food just sits,the most startling thing to me: this is the only Chipotle where the food often looks different,"from a vat of sour cream being spilt on the floor to a cashier giving me a free guac & chips because he claimed ""it comes with the vegetarian burrito""",It is literally impossible to order brown rice via online,I've put it in ALL CAPS and copied and pasted it 5 times in a row in the requests section and they still give me white rice,he turned around and in the process almost stabbed another female employee walking up behind him with a new pan of chicken,Tonight they were out of the corn salsa ,And many times the corn salsa ,and pico de gallo salsa actually look different,Often the corn salsa looks like a straight-up,directly over the meat station,When I pointed out he was raining razor sharp shards of metal into the meat,Earlier this week they were out of steak,The steak is often far undercooked,I love rare steak ,but I imagine some of the deep blood-red chunks of steak I've seen at this location turn many,and lettuce,lettuce, can of corn with a few,The most impressive thing about Chipotle is how consistent the quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love burrito fix at this place,This is the only place I will indeed have a burrito seriously trust me I am Mexican,I always top my bowl or burrito with mild,The white lemon parsley rice is one of my favorite, parts with black beans,Anyways the Barbacoa meat had the right,cheese ,sour cream,corn,The ingredients are simple, amount of spicy and juicy and is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the steak burrito ,and was very disappointed in the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The customer service is subpar and good luck on getting your food in under 20 minutes,The worst chipotle I have ever been too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tasty food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I work in the area so it's one of the few options since georgesville food places have horrible,A week ago we went in after ordering online to pick up our food,The last order we had didn't have any hot sauce when we requested it on the burrito ,I order a chicken burrito (which the chicken did take really good,She then huffs and went to wrap my burrito WITHOUT PUTTING the cheese in,I proceed to sit down to eat and I open my burrito ,and from where the woman wrapped my burrito she had split the tortilla in half ,and I had to eat my burrito with a fork because it was spilling out everywhere,I asked for extra of sour cream cheese ,A drop of sour cream and crumbs of cheese, this time) but I get down to the topping and ask for extra cheese ,and lettuce,Got like 2 pieces of lettuce,my cousin asked for no lettuce ,and she received more lettuce than I did,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I eat here once a week and the food is always so yummy,I just LOVE their guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once I went and they were out of lids for burrito bowls however every time Im here some white,chips are stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I mean it's chipotle so obviously it's amazing,The chips and guac are really good too but it can get pricey,I like the steak the most,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"one person whose job is just ""marker"" and they STILL have a hard time keeping track of the food",This place is pure stress that not even a burrito bowl can cure,The only good thing about this place is that they are so disorganized they often times forget to mark off that you got guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We all know the food you get at Chipotle,The food is what it is, Do they roll the best burrito, Plenty of times the tortilla is breaking apart as they pack my burrito for a to go meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went last Sunday & ended up with a bad case of food poisoning that is still lingering,but food poisoning once is food poisoning one too many,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The WORST chipotle i,also the portions were very small and they will literally charge you extra dollar for everything on the side or extra (obviously meat but im talking about other ones like salsa ,and cheese),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is by far the worst chipotle location,Good quality is HORRIBLE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My biggest complaint is that the food portions have definitely gotten smaller since I first ate here over a year ago,If you want better quality and higher quantity of similar food,Get a bowl not a burrito (tortilla on the side is free,Ask for double of everything (rice,beans,double meat costs extra,lettuce,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was planning on one star- but the second star is for the good food,The music is insufferably loud- to the point where you need to yell at the employee making your food just so they can underst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love that it's on the drag and ridiculously close to campus and that they serve great tasting food,Can't go wrong with the steak burrito bowl,Something about their cilantro lime rice makes it super,They also have a brown rice alternative too if you prefer it,I took a star off because sometimes they skimp out on portions but I just ask for extra rice in that case,I always end up only eating half of the bowl ,The steak comes out in delicious, cubed chunks and the corn is super,Still tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is also reminiscent, I can buy all the ingredients myself and make food for a week for less than the cost of those 3 mediocre, It was over $11 for the burrito,On the on-going burrito tour, Over $9 for 3 soft shell tacos, tacos,It is also WAY overpriced, They layer on the guacamole , w/guacamole (,and sour cream to the point that it really starts detracting from the overall, taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Absolutely the slowest chipotle I have ever been to in my life,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food has gone downhill recently,I usually order a salad bowl,The last two times I barely had a cup of lettuce in my bowl,It tasted pretty much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,you can count on same food,and price,price ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food is always delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The flavor and quality have become more consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They ran out of black beans ,so there was a 10 minute wait if you wanted black beans instead of pinto,beans,How is Chipotle out of lettuce,and they were out of several ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From the burritos to the bowls it's all delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
+ great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I told the guy I didn't want it on my food, The serving sizes are pathetic for the price,Everyone is always adding guacamole to their dish so I asked to sample it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 And the corn is often very cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What didn't make sense to me was that the staff had decided to start their closing duties a whole two hours early and decided not to continue remaking/stocking their food items once it reached a particular,By this point the line had diminished and I was one of two other people ordering food,We were never asked if our food was to go,she had already smothered my whole bowl with salsa before I even finished my sentence,and the cashier just stared at us after pushing our bowls to my friend ,the workers informed us that they were out of black beans,So much so that when I asked the lady for salsa on the side,and guacamole,steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also give way less food than all of the other,And half the time we're left wondering if it's the employee's first time folding a burrito,They can't even cook rice correctly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle slowly losing their food quality ,I got Stake bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for my tortilla inside my bowl and he not only put it on the outside he also put the incorrect rice in both of our bowls,I reached what I thought was the end of just an unfortunate string of events and when I asked for guacamole I received the most scathing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,- no complaints regarding taste & quality of the food itself,but don't get a burrito unless you want to end up eating it off the floor,but I was promptly reminded the second I got to the end of the burrito line,Every time I have gotten a burrito at Chipotle,the employees prove to be incompetent in the simple task of rolling a burrito,I used to ask for them to re-wrap my burritos ,So today I stormed back up to the front after my burrito fell apart after 2 bites,I had never even noticed the way people wrap their burritos,Stay away from their burritos,Today I forgot why it was that I had converted to bowls after my first,and I asked for a bowl to dump the contents into,Again - bowls are delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is decent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
More times than not it's a positive experience when I get the food to go,pull the food to the back before you roll the tortilla up,Only chipotle in ,How do you work at chipotle ,and not know how to drain the beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today the chicken lacked flavor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so be prepared to wait 20+ minutes for your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the burrito bowl keeps bringing me back, My favorite is the chicken bowl with rice,or rice,black beans,  I've never had wilted lettuce or undercooked beans, I think they put something in the salsa that makes me crave them,green salsa,meat,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my food has been super,I tossed my whole bowl in the garbage the first,I'm not sure who they have cooking the meat in the evenings ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Chipotle may be the reason I stop going to chipotle in general,Congratulations New Albany chipotle,and I walk in and get told they are out of cheese and the corn salsa,the annoyingly under portioned ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,rice,chicken,hot salsa etc,guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My experience in this chipotle location is magnificent,Fair enough this chipotle have to deal rude,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They ripped my burrito while rolling it 3 times,but they didn't give me any free chips for it or anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only is the food healthy,Chipotle's burritos ,and burrito bowls are above,but did you know that the business is also very charitable and will give away a free burrito if you dress like one on Halloween,and the rice is super,This is because Chipotle uses naturally grown meat (or so the business claims) ,The meat is well-seasoned,and very fresh ingredients, and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are true fast-food workers here,So I ignore the kids behind the counter and just make sure my bowl is made right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the slowest chipotle ever,This particular establishment brings shame to the chipotle franchise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I order the veggie burrito, The white rice is so delicious,it made me like white rice again-,I surmise by taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food has been cold and tasteless each time I have tried to give them another chance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brice Rd or Pickerington locations are much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's the best way to get your food as a customer,My wife says that consistently this location has the best guacamole of any Chipotle in Orl,how different some of the items can taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We are pretty easy when it comes to ordering our food ,meaning that we don't ask too many questions about the ingredient composition of the various things you can add to your burrito/bowl/taco/whatever,The veggies seemed fresh enough and his steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You get more food at a higher quality including fresh,Or you could go to one of the other millions of places with authentic Mexican food, tortillas made on the spot for a lower price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I made it out the door with a burrito in less than 10mins,eat half the burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Used to be a lunch go-to with hearty portions and tasty ingredients,Stale ingredients that taste frozen ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just find it later and enjoy your food,Obviously the food was delicious,Just enjoy your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I eat here all the time and the food is very consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay so my life is totally and completely engulfed with burrito bowls from Chipotle,this chipotle in particular,and the steak is always cooked perfectly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nothing worse than someone sitting BEYOND close into your personal space and you can hear food breaking down in their mouths,Chipotle has fresh food,love the brown rice ,and their lime chips are just amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The last time my food came 2 minutes late,I really enjoy their taco bowls ,I love chipotle so much,and they are only seven dollars which is very reasonably priced,and their guacamole is really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I thought previous reviewers/quick-tippers were exaggerating but literally 4 out of 4 people I encountered while ordering/preparing my burrito bowl had to ask me to repeat myself multiple,They didn't even get the contents right but I stopped caring halfway through making my burrito once they got to the salsas/cheese/lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've only ordered online at this location and picked up my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I originally went to the chipotle off stassney,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I guess the only thing negative I can say is that there isn't a frequent buyer's card because I would be getting free vegetarian burrito bowls left ,chipotle,but these things are minor when it comes to how delicious you know your meal is going to be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Today the steak has so much,The steak was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Almost no one there knows how to roll a burrito (not too loaded),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the chicken was veryyyyy,But the chicken was very burnt,Doesn't help I forgot guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 While the food is st,predictable quality at a reasonable price - the service is absolutely awful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brown rice felt like I was eating hard elongated pieces of sand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ate half my bowl before I even got Guac because they took 7 years to make it in the back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
under-seasoned food,I've had so many issues here: undercooked rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really enjoy the taste of chipotle food,Anyone that knows chipotle knows how good,I love love love love love love love loooooove chipotle,I eat at chipotle twice weekly if not more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just upset about the amount of food they give,I've been to chipotles in many different states but this one doesn't even fill a burrito bowl to the top of the bowl, They easily give no more than 3/4 of what I can get at any other chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am 100% sick of ordering online then coming in and having to wait 15 minutes for them to make my food,After waiting 10 minutes the boy working at the register jumped off and made my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I am a big fan of the recently added brown rice and always enjoy my burrito or taco's, I wish they had more options such as plain tomato's and other vegetables to fill up the burrito with,pico and corn salsa), I am not a fan of onions (which are found in the guacamole,"not listening when I said ""no cheese please""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Did an online order and sent someone to go pick up food,chips ,and guacamole,Food isn't ready because they ran out of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They want you to get your food ,This chipotle is sllllloooowww,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seemed like they forgot to season the food,Chicken burrito bowl tasted awful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and then she proceeded to touch everything he told her to skip while she was prepping his food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We were asked to wait 20 minutes for rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am not a huge fan of burritos nor do I usually love chicken breast,This is the creation that I love from Chipotle: burrito bowl,no rice,marinated chicken breast,topped with the corn salsa,I eat it with their delicious chips,a bit of lettuce and lots of guacamole,tons of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Staff gave literally heaping portions of every ingredient to their ""friends"" ",and informed the rest of us that they were out of 2 main ingredients immediately afterward,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If your paying that much for food you should get what they advertise which you don't ,Also food is usually cold,Literally the worst chipotle ever,Not saying chipotle is bad,They barely give you a small scoop of rice,Literally got yelled at by one of their managers because she was trying to tell me a certain bowl was mine ,give you super small meat portions when your supposed to get 4oz of chicken,when it wasn't because it had like no chicken on it ,and beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and now I regret that I didn't ask for a refund as I watched what they did to my food,I went in yesterday for a burrito,But the girl wrapping my burrito was not finished with my burrito,I had to wait a few minutes watching the other workers wrap and re-wrap my burrito like they were training the girl,The girl couldn't wrap my burrito,They then proceeded to dump the contents of my burrito into another tortilla,Then another worker showed the girl how to wrap the burrito,The worker purposely unwrapped the burrito again ,I was surprised that the burrito hadn't made it to the floor at this point,The girl proceeded to try to wrap my burrito,My burrito ended up being a mushed up mess,Why would the workers use my burrito to practice on,Why not train your employees how to wrap them in the back with a practice burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's good food,Given the price and the amount of food you get,I would try it for the taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality hasn't been as acceptable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was good,it was my bad for forgetting to ask for a shell in my burrito bowl until I noticed at the end,with better quality chicken than I remember from previous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So happy they opened this new chipotle right across the street from me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no scarecrow or spin on how fresh the food is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The amount of food you typically get at a chipotle is pretty, top notch especially if you get the burrito bowl,I just want to say that I am a huge chipotle fan,I was so excited to hear that they opened up a chipotle so close to my apartment,this chipotle was not up to par with the other,She gave me about half a scoop of brown rice ,"It barely filled up the bowl even with the ""extra",""" lettuce in it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even though it's impossible to truly say that since their meats are most likely,+ 1 Star for pledging to no longer use GMO ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is a food fast food place to eat,but you meed the right combination of ingredients,and organic ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would stick with the burrito bowls here since every time I've been,they've always had someone new/training rolling up the burritos poorly,they skimped on every ingredient in my burrito except for pico de gallo ,My burrito fell apart the second,90% of the time they're out of rice,The barbacoa tasted suspiciously like beans ,The guacamole had more full,steak,and sour cream (I asked for only a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burrito bowls offer a great alternative to burritos, Their cilantro rice is perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my rice was very much,the rice was still undercooked,my bowl was half filled,but I was not in line when he made my bowl over,And it should be common sense that a paying customer would like their bowl to be filled,and hard and my meat was not cooked thoroughly,except meat,he explained that anyone is able to ask for extra ingredients without paying extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It takes away from the other flavors of the burrito,They put way too much salsa ,They completely ignore your request for less salsa ,someone would not complain about portions but when you add a crap load of hot salsa ,and sour cream all you can taste is the crap load of the salsa ,and sour cream and barely any cheese,and sour cream and when you ask for more cheese they add a dash of cheese,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am a racist gentrifier who loves pushing out POC from their homes and businesses and destroying local cultures by supporting cheap and insulting imitations of their food ,I love how mild their food is, Real Mexican food is TOO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Still great food though which I why I will return,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Runing out of the only meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the chicken here ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Closest chipotle to my house ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And made my burrito so sloppy,Unless you love sloppy burritos that have not fresh, meat and aren't consistent with other chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always the slowest chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also they don't give ENOUGH meat in their burritos,I still love chipotle,just run down to chipotle,The chicken is a little,it tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
taco,full of rice,lettuce, If you hestiate for one second you suffer the scorn of the employees ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and they are always out of foods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the place was filthy with food crumbs all over tables ,tasted like lime scented detergent cleaner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My first chicken bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-Plenty of food,I had to destroy my burrito,- undercooked rice,The chicken here Sucks,I found myself taking the chicken out so that I could eat the veggies which were like whatever,- shitty chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second while ordering my food I didn't even have time to say ""black",Once I finally sat down to eat my bowl I noticed my rice was swimming in a water-tomato," beans please"" when my bowl was already at the register",So in the end my bowl was the worst tasting Chipotle bowl I have ever had,How can you mess up a bowl,I got half a scoop of burnt chicken, As far as the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have a couple of young girls on the line making people's food that seem very unhappy,I used to LOVE chipotle,My horrible experiences with this one location has changed my perception of chipotle forever,You order a bowl ,and they give you barely a spoonful of meat,but then 3 pounds of sour cream,Who wants that much sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best chipotle h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plus thus location seems to screw you over more than any other on the amount they put in the burrito,Taste the same as any chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered a burrito,a chorizo and a biw with steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a bowl with chicken ,and chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I live in canal and will drive to tussling rd or pickerington for the service and better food,They constantly burn your food,I love chipotle,I loathe this chipotle,have stale chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She tries to be so quick and starts wrapping up your burrito while you are still talking,It happened today and she only gave me very little guacamole which felt bad,Food quality has gone down at this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and until recently the food was kept hot,I know you probably have new standards for meal prep with the recent food illness,They create the perfect bowl every time ,"PS- Staff may need educating on what ""a tiny little bit of sour cream"" means as it has not ever translated correctly and I wind up with a liqui-bowl",there's recently been a change to your steak,I loved this Chipotle for their steak cooking abilities,All in all- steak need more melt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and acts like each ingredient or topping I ask for is a terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Watched my food get cold," Overpriced for bad service and cold ""fresh"" food"," Rather go somewhere other than ""fast food"" for a decent lunch meal at the same price",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-If you're not food baby hungry,you can also have your burrito wrapped in TWO tortillas,95) or a single taco ($2,-Even though they ask you if you want black or pinto beans and white or brown rice,even if you order a bowl or a salad,"(So if I say ""half chicken",Everyone's all I could eat Chipotle every second of my life or like I used to like Chipotle but now they don't smile and give me less meat,-Those grilled vegetables for vegetarian entrees can also be added to meat entrees for free,-You can also do this with meats,half steak,""" I'll get charged for steak)",You can always get a big flour tortilla or up to three corn tortillas on the side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is our second time eating here and the food was nothing ,The rice was under cooked,The rice was hard,my husband and I ordered 2 bowls with steak,mushy pieces in our bowls,we ordered exactly same things with 2 bowls,the bowls were full,they used that same hands to grab the lettuces and put into our bowls,lettuce was old, of lettuce ends,corn kernels were still hard,All i wanted is to tell her to check the quality before serving to customers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am still giving 3 stars because of the food itself,I got my usual burrito bowl - awesome as usual,"I had to repeat ""a burrito bowl not a burrito"" three times for them to get it right",because when the staff were wrapping the burritos for the customers in front of as well as behind me,the tortilla ripped and the burritos EXPLODED,This goes to show two things: 1) they don't skimp on ingredients 2) they lack the competency to properly roll a burrito,It's still a good place to get your burrito fix,The staff who made my bowl barely made any eye contact with me,Good thing I got a bowl though,I would just recommend you getting a bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I get a lot of food for a very reasonable, I always get a burrito bowl , price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I feel great when I eat here because the food is high,and they always hook me up with extra veggies and lettuce , quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
running out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
juice and we had To wait for the kids' bags of chips to be made up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The flavor and quality of the food is getting significantly worse,The food quality isn't completely terrible,The employees are not careful about keeping the worktop clear of food,But the worst part is that they contaminate food because of their lack of sanitation,My roommate is vegan - chipotle is one of the few,I ordered a bowl for pick up,got home and found that it didn't even fill up half of the bowl which everyone knows is not normal, - when chicken still looks ,and tastes like chicken,there is cheese in the guacamole,but the employees here truly must not care about accidentally mixing cheese into their vegan guacamole,You can't trust this location to have a clean workstation and you can't trust that there isn't cheese in the guacamole - vegans beware,it's corporate's fault for thinking that it's a good idea to put cheese right next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food for a decent,Chipotle has some fresh tasting food ,Might I add that despite being as busy as hey were and getting food out as fast as they were,My only issue with chipotle is its lack of toppings,Despite the line moving pretty fast for a chipotle line (chipotle,I applaud you chipotle,price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fresh food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its almost like they are downsizing their burritos because of the recession,Compared to other chipotles,Id recommend staying away from this place unless you are looking for a cheap lunch or have to have chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I expect better quality food from y'all,a steak burrito bowl,that was the worst steak I've ever had at your restaurant,I remember having amazing steak at Chipotle before,This last one contrasted in that it seemed the steak had been fished out of a soup with no seasoning,it tasted as if it had been boiled instead of grilled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cold food,Just moved to the area and decided to check out the closets chipotle,I got told by a super rude employee that they were out of white rice,I got towards the end of the line and asked for only one of my bowls to have corn salsa,they didn't have any chicken,they gave the tiniest scoop of chicken to all the people waiting,and I told her I only asked for corn on one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually love chipotle with a burning passion,I was not given lettuce ,So when I went up to the cashier I asked for lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(I like it on my tacos,they are ALWAYS out of something and it's usually one of the meats,This is also the only location that charges me an extra 90 cents for their salad dressing,since I am not getting a salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can always get a friendly chat while designing my own burrito,but always a quality meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I couldn't even hear the workers ask what I wanted in my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the burrito makers are fast,and the burrito that is waiting for you at the end is worth the wait,and the ingredients are always FRESH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always flavorful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I paid for guacamole on my taco ,and my bowl,Dressing for my salad bowl missing too,No guacamole in either so I had to use the one I bought for my chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typically during peak hours the line is out the door so expect a wait for your burrito, But the wait for these burritos is worth it,   Overall chipotle is still a great,I'll take black beans please,this location has been inconsistent in speed and quality of service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They pick up food ,they handle your food,We eat chipotle very often,The rice is undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a salad with no rice (trying to be low,and it clearly has brown rice all up ,I couldn't even eat half of the salad because of all this flagrant rice,and through this salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They use cage free beefs and chickens in their food which is much better than in the cage,The burritos can be big,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito I had was fine, (they were out of taco shells),During the 27 minutes I was in line there was a wait for chicken twice,a wait for steak twice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chipotle here is actually pretty,mediocre compared the the chipotles i have gone to,This location gives small quantities of meat and protein like beans so don't be surpri,The meat i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always so yummy,but the price for guacamole is ridiculous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not bad for food in an airport, 1st time having chipotle, I will defiantly be checking out a chipotle back home for sure, The bowls where fantastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
huge burritos, Chipotle is a good choice for meat eaters,fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Placed an order online and the food was not prepared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food ,I really love eating at Chipotle and my favorite item is the the burrito bowl,They gave me way to much and I had dig to find the rest of the ingredients in my bowl,"when I say ""a little bit of lettuce"" that means a little",I did not come for a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On my last visit I left without food,They didn't have lids for the bowls ,One girl was getting orders wrong despite being right in front of the customers - I said pinto beans,she tried to give me black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff acts as if they are doing me a favor by preparing my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I mean it's chipotle so the flavor ,and the quality is the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would recommend driving another 5-10 miles to find another chipotle before stopping here,It seems like it would be difficult to screw up a meal in a chain restaurant that has only 15 ingredients available,It's obvious the owner/manager does not care about their quality of employees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are good at rolling a good fat burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's definitely a keeper and a good place to go for consistently good food,everything tastes pretty st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Chipotle food , I usually eat the soft tacos with chicken ,and they put so little meat in each taco it is ridiculous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My complaint was about the food,My husband complained more than I did and he usually always salts his food,My husband and I both had the vegetarian burrito bowl ,but maybe the beans,I am on a restricted salt diet so it's not just about the taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and stingy on the chips,stingy on the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It's hard to find decent food close to a college campus, I bit down on my burrito , I usually get chicken ,and one thing I hate about getting chicken in a restaurant is biting down into a huge,and felt the sickening squeak of inedible chicken part on my teeth," There are absolutely zero people in the entire world who would prefer ""more volume by means of cartilage"" to ""less volume of real chicken meat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If any chipotle employees/management are reading this,If the customer thinks they need a little more rice/carnitas it would be a good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I ordered the 3 tacos, combination (2 chicken ,the chicken ,and 1 steak) along with an order of chips , I decided at last moment to get the chips ,and steak was DRY and the chips were HALF-BAKED ,and guacamole plus a beer,and guacamole ,told me he was waiting on the steak to complete my order , I pointed the other dude out and said he was supposed to be getting the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is just like any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love their burrito bowls,The burrito bowl is bigger than the burrito wrap itself,I usually pick chipotle,The chicken has a spice to it so if you don't like spicy be careful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
especially meat,but compared to other others it is stingy on ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was not fresh,I'll never go back to this chipotle ever again,The lettuce was old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food looked,I visited this location yesterday and let me just tell you it was the worst experience I've ever had at chipotle,When I asked them to make me some more steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They gave me less in my burrito here than anywhere else,'extra rice',and 'extra salsa',despite me asking for 'extra lettuce',it was delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A lot of people seem to give the staff hell over the proportions of the meat you get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are always out of food,Most of the time the employees barely give you any food in your bowl/burrito,Some days only one employee is working the food line while you see other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 and washing some food trays things could only get better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
skip all the other overpriced drag food ,You will get a burrito that is borderline too much food for you to eat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only is the food delish,I get the burrito- double rice,I support Chipotle's save the earth through burritos cause,corn salsa,and cheese- and the chips with medium salsa,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A few employees peeked out from behind the back to see who the asshole was that demanded clean food,She asked us what we wanted and I said A salad please and before I could finish she had a fistful of lettuce,"""  She THREW the the lettuce back in the in ",A few minutes passed and a different employee came put put on clean gloves and made our salads with the lettuce dirty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the Chicken bowl,she double said with the lady who made the bowl if I got extra,and the cashier asked me if I got extra chicken, chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never will go back it was horrible either the meat is bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I decided on chicken,sharpen her knife and the cut into some cooked steak for the line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expanded nationwide and then started cutting corners,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't get me wrong their food was consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle isn't cheap and yet they made my burrito about half the size it usually is,We usually get the chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is gross,This is the worst chipotle I've ever seen ,The meat is chewy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,I'm used to when food drippings fall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Run out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They always ask me about my day and accommodating if I want extra rice or veggies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually avoid the chains in Austin since the local food scene is so good,but got some food here by the campus due,Pretty solid food as always,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had to ask the employee to wipe down the station before making my food,Dirtiest chipotle I've ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was lucky to receive a coupon for a free burrito (post e,Got myself a fully-loaded burrito bowl ,the rice a perfect,I love that they use real ingredients - the chicken is juicy ,I also love the lime infused chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is no longer consistent,other times the food has no flavor,Some days the food is right,kind of miss having chipotle's,The chips either come out to salty or have a stale, in flavor or taste, taste to them,in taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chewy meat is not good food,If you like chewing on gristly chicken,Seems like the quality of the meat is going down hill over the years,steak etc then this is the place for you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito had almost no rice,The burrito as a whole was kind of stale ,and too many beans,But the worst part was the chips,When I got home and tried to eat the chips ,I realized most of the chips were completely undercooked,So now I have a jar full of decent (but oversalted) guacamole and no chips to eat them with,and guacamole,The steak was all cartlidge ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you really want a burrito,the burrito isn't bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Like every chipotle I'm always pleased,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is inexpensive,you know what I mean when I say some of their employees can be skimpy with the ingredients (especially meat),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its my money paying for food i want so why do these people tey so hard,Now when it comes time to roll my burrito i,always ask please roll it longer and thinner as i dont enjoy trying to stuff a 4inch wide 4 inch long burrito in my mouth,The steak is less than good so i end up having to gset the chicken which is on par with baby Acapulco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had the barbacoa burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All the food is bl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh did I mention that they really do skimp on meats ,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the moment we got to the register the cashier bagged all our stuff then went and proceeded to fill ten bags of chips before letting us pay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I normally get the white rice ,Some days the rice is a little,And I wish they'd stop trying to skimp me on the rice ,"and chicken b/c I am not trying to eat a ""veggie bowl""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love their food, I told him I'd go just to prove how nasty the food is, Their food didn't give me migraines like McDonalds does,My burrito bowl was super, Even the rice was good,cheese & chicken,The only thing I could ding them on is that their chips are WAY too salty,so I am guessing they use less chemicals and real meat (I'm serious, Their guacamole is fab as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The menu is your typical corporate one with the typical quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The guy preparing my food was laughing ,and joking with a coworker and subsequently forgot to put the guacamole in the bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I like the seating options (of which there are plenty) and the food is the same,good Chipotle food you love ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The line is always understaffed and it takes a good 45 minutes to an hour just to get your food,This chipotle is by far the worst service in the area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They took my order and made my food,I went to eat my food,One of my tacos had a heck lot of meat,The lettuce was taste like straight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything was luke warm at best including the rice,They tried to not give me any salsa or sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are much better food options in the mall food court than this establishment,Service was friendly but food was only subpar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great people great food,This chipotle is fucking amazing,which is odd for a chipotle,because they love chipotle too ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop complaining and just get your damn burrito,All chipotles have a line because everyone wants to eat there,More seating than most chipotles ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This isn't about the quality of food at this location ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It looked like all the food was out so I'm not sure,And they ran out of white rice that time too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wouln't recommend this place to eat burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chicken burrito bowl,-A heated up tortilla along with your burrito bowl at no extra,-Half brown/half white rice,If you want more rice or peppers or beans,-A pinch of cilantro on top of your bowl (if you love cilantro as much,no beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is delish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
decent quality food that is quite filling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered two burrito bowls,The red salsa (hot,We mixed that with fresh salsa,but that's expected for that type of meat,We asked whether the steak was tender ,The steak was terrible,They need to do something about the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I not only had to ask for more meat on my bowl,but I was told after waiting to pay that the restaurant was out of chips , Had I known that there were no chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as we work 3rd shift I I thought what a nice way to get food with out me having to get up early,I ordered 2 bowls to pick up on my way to work for a friend ,However at 2am when we took our lunch to eat our bowls,One bowl was made wrong,I asked him why he couldn't write down what I wanted in my bowl I would pick it up on my way to work ,Half the ingredients we wanted were missing ,but it had ingredients on there that we never asked for ,and she couldn't eat it because she didn't like the ingredients that was on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the worst chipotle restaurants out there,Two stars since its a chipotle ,we ordered the same order and paid four different prices,They have the skills to ruin chips and even the rice at times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food always tastes deliciou,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Since Freebirds is the greatest burrito place ever,I don't try the burrito bowls,because that would entirely defeat the purpose of eating at a burrito place,and beans (Pinto is a no-go,cheese (uh,sour cream is free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also added a bag of chips and salsa to my order at the end ,but when I got back to my office noticed that they had not included the salsa,75 for a bag of chips,veggies & steak),and there was a 10-15 minute wait on lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but really quick service & same quality of food as bigger locations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location served some of the freshest food I've had at a Chipotle in years,delicious rice,EXCELLENT guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you're tired of the burrito go with a bowl or salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I stopped in at 9:00 for my usual steak burrito bowl, I cut my losses at this point and went a couple blocks away to a competing burrito place, It took 15 minutes to finally be asked what I wanted only to be informed that no chicken or steak was available, The service has always been awful but healthy ingredients kept me coming back ,  Then the manager showed up and said despite having the ingredients that she did not want to dirty the stove again even though they were open,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food is always cold,I was given burnt chicken scraps in my burrito bowl because they had not taken the time to replenish the stock,Worst chipotle I've ever been to,Until then I will start driving to Easton or Hamilton road when a chipotle craving strikes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My boyfriend said no one was helpful when he was ordering and the chips were stale, The steak in our meals were fishy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All three people who helped prepare the food were completely oblivious,Never looked at me or smiled and (I had a double wrapped burrito) managed to roll my burrito with the insides spilling out both ends,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seriously the best chipotle in Austin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yesterday I went for lunch and ordered 2 bowls to go,etc) was doing my bowls (both were the same,ingredients) she went to add to the third bowl,And then the man behind me (who had the 3rd bowl she was about to garnish) she just put a lid on his ,When the girl who does the garnishes (salsa,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stingy with meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cold food because the line is slow,and noticeably smaller portions than other chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  The additional option of a burrito in a bowl is very nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They don't give you as much food as other,chipotles but the food quality is the same,kinda reminded me of the cheese they serve you in elementary school) and some of the chips were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99 Plato from the dollar store and this is the first time it's happened like three times now it's a huge turn off for me because I go to chipotle because it's only thing the area and I like it when my food smells like The preschool room it just grosses me out,I go here prob once to twice a week and last few times I've went my tortillas for my burritos have smelt like Plato they've been cold,you going to take a big bite of your burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't know how the food was today because myself ,This location is consistently the worst staffed and slowest chipotle in the Columbus area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is awesome, Keep offering great food Chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fresh,chips were perfection as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food warmers were still empty,This is the third time I have gotten cold food from this location,I'm not sure if it is a management issue but the staff really doesn't seem to care much about the quality and freshness of their food,My least favorite of all chipotle locations in the Portl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of my favorite burrito chains,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to the fresh food ,I have never been charged for salsa on the side of my salad I was told it's a new,policy although my boyfriend who was behind me in line wasn't charged for his side of salsa nor have I ever been since then or before at any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really i think its overtly expensive for the food it is,Chipotle is chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mexican food is always a delight for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle service ever,I hate that this is the chipotle I live closest to because the service is terrible,they have ingredients in other things - cheese in the salsa (what if someone wants that salsa ,They unevenly distribute ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You know what doesn't fix the slow service and below par food,bad food quality,or a casual black hair in my food,and quality of food,if I'm making an order of 3 burritos - I might choose the first,If I order 15 burritos- I would give around 45 minutes from the time ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle ever,and it took them 20 minutes to make from when they put the lettuce in the bowl until I checked out,I ordered a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
real food ,I have not had any issues with this location or my food,Thank you Chipotle for offering fresh real food,A fast food type restaurant that uses fresh and ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and usage of organic and local source foods ,Now my calling card is that you can switch the rice for the whole,grain rice,It taste just as good to me as the regular rice: the cilantro always steals the show,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get the 3 taco tortillas instead of the burrito one unless you like ripping up tortilla pieces and trying to awkwardly wrap food in them ,and hoping the food stays in on its way to your mouth,if you get a burrito bowl ,it's chipotle,it's what you'd expect from chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food they put together,it reminds me of the first time i discovered the delicacy of burrito heaven that is Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's first time I ever tried chipotle food ,I would go to local Mexican spots to get real and tasty food at better price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How does a cooperate business like chipotle allow such,I love a chipotle finally being close,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a Flour Burrito with Cilantro-lime rice,All 3 salsa's,Best choice I made was to get all 3 salsa choices in one,and hot salsa's ,cheese,sour cream,lettuce ,and provided a fresh spicy taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get the chicken burrito or bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  Chipotle corporate should come in and have a talk with them before they drag the chipotle name even further through the mud,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GREAT customer service and healthy food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
teenagers training newly hired teenagers who have no concept of how to make a taco or wrap a burrito,Chipotle is not chipotle if you have an extra,burnt chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like my guac on top of a Chipotle bowl with brown rice,chicken,pico salsa,corn salsa,I'll get a side of chips to go with it,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff is always friendly and the food is always fresh,I do mix the medium and hot salsa together for a dynamic addition to any burrito,I also love the vegetable burrito,chipotle does not have Queso,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I visited the Camp Creek location after work for a bowl and to my dismay they only had white rice,The server offered no explanation as to why or when some more brown rice would arrive,I've been to many different Chipotle's and not once have they ever only had white rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never had a problem ordering from this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Probably my worst chipotle experience ever,very small portions of everything else in the bowl including guac,My chicken was so burnt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's average Chipotle food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pick up orders also always have at least one mistake (like no guacamole on a veggie burrito) ,and sometimes they try to charge you extra for guac on the veggie burrito,They're running low on ingredients half the time so they skimp you on veggies and cheese ALL the time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Received my yummy food with a smile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only one guy was preparing all of the food ,and one girl was emptying the garbage and then handing out the food ,but  they were out of black beans -- wow ,this Chipotle location is next door to PUBLIX -- why don't they just go to publix and buy some black beans,I was expecting them to be out of some exotic ingredient or something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got back to my office to a cold burrito for me,"1:13 (I really like my watch) and someone comes out and says ""did you have the tacos",She made the tacos,and tacos missing part of their order for my co-worker,How long is a sec in chipotle land,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is always good,casual food options,reasonably priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've had the best burritos here and I've also had them collapse in a hot mess that quite often is comparable to their food line,This location has run out of cheese more than once ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lines are super long and slower then other chipotles I have been to,Other then that I love their chicken bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also great food as always Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ordered some food for a lunch with potential,Took the food by the store after our meeting , clients and the first salad they opened had a bug crawling around in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of food seems to be improved ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is sooo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Both the steak and chicken were full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't get a lot of food for the price ,Plus they charged me extra for guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my tacos had so little,I didn't get any beans or rice, meat in them I'm currently eating some chicken curry across the street at H-Mart,so on top of the paltry serving of meat,Still tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the best chipotles I've been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff were all friendly and customized my Chipotle regular (steak burrito with black,white rice, beans,cheese,sour cream,corn ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Went back today after going to Brice Rd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is one of those places if you want to get some quick mexican food in the form of a burrito,This food is not only cheap in price,tacos,"I have read numerous articles online about what it says on ""how to get the most value from a chipotle"" or ""how to not cheap out at chipotle""",-Get brown rice,bowls,-Ask for a bowl with tortillas on the side (make sure,chicken ,black beans,corn salsa,cheese ,and lettuce to finish it off (I like extra,lettuce for mines),or salad form,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amazing staff and the best steak I've had out of a chipotle h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go here quite often for lunch and my burrito is always a different,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grab your burrito ,Get a chicken salad or even a veggie salad for a healthy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 which it is what it is but the food was horrible, and the person wraping the burritos had no idea what she was doing ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I go they're nice and give good portions of meat,Any Chipotle that gives me good portions of meat is a Chipotle I will always go to,The meat here looks good,I usually get a steak salad,but I've been opting for a steak quesadilla with diced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
end up smashing the crap out of the burrito to the point where you can't even eat it without dumping it out onto a plate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the standard of burritos,When you ask for double meat,I hope on my next visit I can get that full scoop of delicious steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$9 for a burrito bowl w/no drink cost them a star,Holy guacamole,fast and generous with the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have good food,and the food tasted like any other,It's one of my favorite burrito chains,They stuff the heck out of the burritos,This is another Chipotle that tastes like any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am no longer a vegetarian yet i usually order a veggie burrito because i,plus i like beans,McDonald's owned chain and all (edit-no longer as of late 2008/early 2009) The meat they use is  free,t  comes with guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They've often gone out of their way for me and hooked me up with a free burrito (likely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've always appreciated Chipotle's soy-free food options,It is a life-saver for vegans with food allergies,The food quality is off,I've also had the weirdest chips - no salt or oil,I'm a vegan but the people I've been with continually have problems with meats - always fat,the steak was all fat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have eaten chicken burritos at chipotle,and it was the worst chicken burrito ,it made the chicken room temperature,The chicken was also tasteless,the salsa ,and salad was so cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had to ask for 3 scoops of rice,guacamole and meat just to get the same,2 scoops of veggies and extra cheese,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He took off the old ones after touching non food service things ,I work in fast/casual food service ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food at Chipotle is made with quality ingredients,my wife who is vegetarian loves the food,My favorite item on the menu is the burrito bowl,then try the burrito or the tacos,I highly recommend getting the pinto beans ,All the same ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and a good burrito you can count on is something to appreciate,"""Drag"" Location: Although this locale is generally packed with patrons the line moves like a bowl of rice ",and beans,presented with the hardest decision you may face all day: chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One star off for the rather unfriendly staff and being charged for chips even though we never asked for it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 This used to be the best Chipotle with efficient staff and fresh food, The food, Crunchy rice,dried up beans,chewy chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came in at 9pm tonight and all the food looked old,All of the food looked like it had not been stirred ,I would have left as soon as I saw the cold stale looking food,As a big chipotle fan I was extremely disappointed,a bowl to go with brown rice ,"the girl grabbed the bowl and asked ""what kind of rice",and a little of both beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted okay,All I can say about this particular location is that the quality was not good.chipotle is usually on point ,never been to a chipotle where I actually had to wait a long,but it wasn't as fresh as it should've been which affected the taste of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is the same,They do a great job making bowls and burritos (other,This is a 5 star chipotle, as any other chipotle,The service is the best I've had at a chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I still ordered and they just assumed that I wanted my food to go ,The food itself wasn't too bad,I have never been inside of a chipotle like this one before,It's in such a weird location that I wasn't even sure it was a chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tomato salsa has improved,Food always tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
before that brown rice,The last time it was chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a salad and when I found out they don't offer white meat chicken I opted for the steak,Hard cheap steak meat,chewy-non-meat parts,very cheap meat,I only ate about 4 real pieces of meat ,Don't get the steak unless you like a lot of gristle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however that they changed from romaine lettuce to iceberg lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is on point ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually get the steak burrito bowl,The lime chips used to be good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food I got today was surprisingly worse than I've gotten at other,The rice in my burrito was undercooked,I greatly prefer Boloco for burritos,and I had to spit out a small chicken bone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cheapskate tip #2:  You mean I can get a burrito bowl,burrito bowls make great,use my own tortillas to make tacos,Brown rice - healthy,Cheapskate tip #1:  Extra rice ,and then eat off that same bowl for three days, Just throw the contents of the bowl over some spinach ,Their chicken has sort of a grilled,flavor to it and is way better than Freebird's chicken,and beans are free, salads,I love that they at least think about organic and local sources for their ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff stopped serving food during peak on Labor Day weekend,We were waiting on chicken,I don't want chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been going to this one for a year & have yet to experience poor service or bad food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This particular location suffers from quality control ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We've gone several times and experienced less than stellar food,This chipotle is one of the worst,several of us went to chipotle to take advantage of their buy get one free,You'd think that regular items like salsa ,and guacamole would be kept prepared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle but can only make the stop when I have 15 minutes to spare (on a good day) to wait in line for the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For a $1 extra you can get guacamole added to your burrito or bowl,I typically stick to the cheap side though and just a chicken fajita bowl with tons of vegetables,I like Chipotle because the meat ,I love their guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great service and filling food,I dined in and ordered 3 soft flour tacos in person,I'm going to order the soft tacos in person for sure,Next time I go to chipotle,The first time I ate here I order a salad bowl with sofritas,online and when I opened it up at work I saw that there was hardly anything in the bowl,I finished the bowl in a few,black beans,salsa ,and cheese,sour cream,lettuce,They could have our way more salad or something,Fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle - rude staff,I always get gobbles of fat all in my bowl ,the meat is NEVER COOKED all the way ,and it's super disgusting plus they never cut out the fat from their steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because the food is still good,Waiting in line is always going to happen at his chipotle, and it's the nearest chipotle so I'll have to make due,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle location in GA,salad dressing is gross,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The most I've ever gotten was three fourths and I was disgustingly full of food ,I always get a nice big burrito with beans ,and meat and cheese and rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was fresh, I had the pork burrito,The hot sauce they put on it was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this place takes forever to get your food (compare to other,I used to go to one in New York that had twice the line and I would get my food in half the time,Also - I've had some inconsistency with the food here,hot salsa ,meat,I go with a salad with extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was VERY tasty, You can also do a more healthy option by forgoing the tortilla shell for a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As far as chipotle goes,this location is prob the best one when it come to cooking the rice all of the way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location is no different then any other chipotle I've been to,Stay consistent chipotle,To their credit the chicken always seemed to be cooked OK,If there's one gripe with me about this location is that they shrimp you out on your meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never had any issues with the food here,I love their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Chipotle may be the reason I stop going to chipotle in general,Congratulations New Albany chipotle,and I walk in and get told they are out of cheese and the corn salsa,the annoyingly under portioned ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"or is this place seriously the best place to get a giant bowl of mush (beans,rice",salsa),",meat",",cheese",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food and service is consistently good as in all chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The store seems busy enough to where the food is used ,Pretty solid chipotle,I've only been once and encountered that they have run out of steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as we work 3rd shift I I thought what a nice way to get food with out me having to get up early,I ordered 2 bowls to pick up on my way to work for a friend ,However at 2am when we took our lunch to eat our bowls,One bowl was made wrong,I asked him why he couldn't write down what I wanted in my bowl I would pick it up on my way to work ,Half the ingredients we wanted were missing ,but it had ingredients on there that we never asked for ,and she couldn't eat it because she didn't like the ingredients that was on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My wife loved her Chicken taco with mild,no rice,had the barbacoa with black beans & veggies,and the hot and corn salsas, salsa, Also some of the chips where soft,unsettling when eating chips,Only drawback was the side of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I had a bowl that was barely half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been to this chipotle numerous,I let this slide being that it was probably new employees but the second time did it and I will never go back to chipotle with the Ebola outbreaks you should be focusing on treating your customers with respect,Screw chipotle ,I went and ordered a chicken bowl as the guy started at what I thought would be a scoop of chicken he instead used the containers they put the guacamole in,So I said is that it as it looked like the unusually small so he scooped another with the plastic container I went to pay and my order came to $10 dollar for a damn chicken bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Generous portions and the house made lime tortilla chips are so good with the corn salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also like that I can go here with my vegan friends (any chipotle),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fresh ingredients (chicken is excellent,"""half chicken","BEST KEPT SECRET: Ask for ""half and half"" meat",you inevitably get more meat than you would if you just asked for a normal,serving of one meat,steak is good,"half steak""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Feeling like a burrito,but I won't let that ruin my burrito,I did not see a salsa bar at this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was served slightly frozen corn salsa on my tacos the last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the kicker- a long hair in my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steak burrito in a bowl with no soul,Thus burrito was terribly bl,could save this bland flavor-free burrito wanna-be,Not even salsa,hot salsa or pick itself,cheese,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food speaks for itself as we all know chipotle is awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the chicken is better , More lettuce isn't going to kill anybody,Just discovered the salads this week, Not as big as a Jack in the Box quick salad, It wouldn't hurt to make the salad a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You guys gave me SEVERE food poisoning,I came in on Wednesday and got a steak burrito ,Last time I ever visit a chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The meat is way,The fact that they can get away with charging $2 for a scoop of guacamole is ridiculous,They get +1 stars for great transparency on their website and full disclosure of their ingredients as well as the fact that they use GMOs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never been to chipotle before,Got a salad bowl with grilled, chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
D$@n you chipotle for having good food or I would never come back here,Guess it was 3/4 bowl day at Chipotle inCanal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I found hair in my food ,Worst chipotle ever it's was my first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" she then put sour cream on my tacos while I repeated ""no thank you",She went to redo the peppers and literally put ONE pepper on each taco,The girl at the second station asked me if u wanted sour cream,""" once she finished I asked what she just put on and she said I thought you wanted sour cream",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NC and the food was absolutely amazing,however when I received my food ,I went back to the counter and asked one of the attendants if they could heat my food up in a microwave or oven ,and was informed that they had nothing to heat up the food,packed up my food,I understand that their food may be warm/hot,but this restaurant should have a warmer or microwave to be able to heat up customer's food since they are a dine in place to eat as well,""" I love my food hot",and at any other restaurant I've visited in the past if the food wasn't hot,for I spent $7 for a burrito ,the chicken was cold,but I expect my meat to at least be warm,and understand that the lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only complaint was I order the cheese sauce for the first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There were two staff members making a bowl,To top it off they had no guacamole made, Why in the world would there be no guacamole made prior to doors opening,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food doesn't taste as great,except for the one gentleman that's serves the rice ,and beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I go here I get a burrito bowl,After a well shaken burrito bowl,I pour half of it into the tortilla and make a small version of a burrito,because I like having more tortilla in ratio to the other stuff in the burrito,extra rice,I get a lid for the bowl,Then I finish off the bowl,It is also a good idea to save the half of the bowl ,half fajita and half black beans,The meat is totally up to you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sit outside if the weather is nice or get your food to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Halfway through the burrito ,Online order was supposed to have double meat and had special instructions to have very little rice,and all I've had is rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They're not grilling steaks they're pouring ready made food into a container, what's it cost to make a freakin bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now maybe I have an over simplified understanding of what goes into making or serving Chipotle food ,Things were forgotten and there was a serious lag on food,I'm not sure how you can mess up a food line ,My food had bypassed him ,The earliest order was some hodge podge of burritos ,but I really feel sorry for the company because of the quality here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Last time I went there the person I was there with got a vege burrito,because they take so long the burrito tends to get cold,it took 10 minutes to get 2 burritos , They hardly gave her any beans ,and then put 2 full ladles of tomato salsa on top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I often have to ask for them to change their gloves because they clean with the same gloves they prepare food with,I give two stars because I love chipotle,I live so close to this chipotle ,Beware of chipotle Howell mill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I red bad reviews about this chipotle about some girl manager being rude ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food ,Vegan options are delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,I looooooove chipotle,I was driving down Murray this evening and decided to try the new location as I haven't had chipotle in quite some time,but it does not taste like the chipotle I know ,Never run into this at any other chipotle,The woman who put together my bowl had no emotion,I get home and my entire bowl is almost flavorless,I even asked for chips ,Also I noticed some of the steak pieces were a bit rare,not to mention the steak is all pieces of fat,and love I am currently eating around the steak pieces , for my taste ,I don't know if my tastes buds are off,but am on the verge of throwing away my tasteless meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food wasn't ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like tortilla chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I always love eating and relaxing at chipotle ,The rice was overcooked ,and my bowl was sloppy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Each time my food was excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very nice and friendly waitress food taste really good,This is one of the best steak house I have been to in a long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their food doesn't have that chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,The quality of food is comparable,I've never had any concerns with ingredient freshness or under or over cooked meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am a huge fan of Chipotle burritos,At Freebirds I have to put the devil sauce on the steak burritos just to make it comparable,Another great thing about Chipotle is what I can only describe as the post-chipotle poo,I soon discovered the joy of double meat (I don't like rice) ,The chicken is usually nice,pinto beans,corn salsa, and juicy and I have discovered that their guacamole is great on chips,And oh the chips,Chipotle will always stand above Freebirds in my mind because the meat is so much more flavorful,Double steak, to Chipotle's amazing steak,cheese,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was able to draft this in less time than what it took the 4 poor staff members to make ONE bowl for one customer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love these burritos,the burrito is still a pretty,I heard the burritos have more calories than a Big Mac,I was sad when they raised the prices by 50 cents,I'm not a fan of the beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Extremely rude and racist food server,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
friendly service and great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hand a telephone to a coworker that was ordering over the food ,She went back to preparing food with those SAME gloves,she puts the phone down and starts back preparing food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I live in Whitehall and this chipotle is less than a minute from me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with choice of quesadilla or two tacos -- incl,Got two tacos with their new,ordered a kid's meal b/c I can never finish a bowl ,and fruit or chips,and all the ingredients were great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered 2 salad bowls ,they were both missing the fajita mix and the bowls were only half,the chicken was salty ,there was only a few pieces of lettuce even though they were salads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is by far the worst chipotle location I've ever been to,Both white and brown rice are extremely undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they gave us a very dirty tray to put out food on that had a lot of sour,Only reason this location got two stars is because of the food, cream and lettuce on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Then as I am in my car I look at the receipt and I was charged for guacamole when I had no guacamole in my burrito didnt even order guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also need to install a microwave next to the soda machine because my food was super,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle food is always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 stars mainly for the service not the food,Since the burritos are so huge,and I can never finish one in one sitting I had planned to have them make my burrito ,VEGGIE burrito,I asked if she could cut my burrito in half ,""" all of this for a Veggie burrito",Finally I asked for guacamole (which comes complimentary,As I'm moving down the line she skimps again on the corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019: 3 tacos (steak,As my tacos were being assembled in front of me,I noticed that the young woman was putting approximately 1 tablespoon of meat on each taco,I asked the Person assembling my tacos if the micro-portions were new,My 3 soft tacos were put in foil ,I should have checked the average rating of this chipotle before I even walked in,pork and barbacoa) and a small chicken quesadilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I work in the food industry ,and I completely understand forgetting a napkin or to go sauce but when you COMPLETELY forget an entire burrito that all you had to do was add to the bag,Worst chipotle I have ever been to,if you want quality I'm sure ANY other chipotle in Ohio is better,And they didn't say anything about running out of sour cream until the very end,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I order salads I always request the dressing,and thus time was no different: 2 salads with 2 dressings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but each time I'm overwhelmed with the portions and the delicious food,it's good food, The employees are very nice and kindly let me know that the pinto beans have bacon in them and I've selected a veggie burrito bowl,decently priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Omg I found a huge LEAF in my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can't give 1 star because I love Chipotle's food--,They have consistently made the worst burritos I've experienced from any Chipotle,and this is coming from a guy who once ate 20+ chipotle meals in under 20 days (don't ask),then almost no rice, Simple things like putting WAY too many beans,Then the guacamole levels,then scooping way too much liquid in with the corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Now I should know better than to go into a restaurant less than 30 minutes from closing but I was looking for Mexicanesque food , I ordered a steak burrito, Not many salsa options or other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it seems like the food is never hot, The food tastes soooooo different,00 burrito , I ordered a quesadilla tonight and it was just warm and the cheese was not even melted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a veggie bowl ,I was happy to see the grill filled with what looked to be real chicken,The meals were good and my only complaint is the amount of chips you get for $1,and a steak salad for the mister, steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another bowl was completely wrong and could not be consumed since the person ordering if cannot eat spicy food,The manager needs to be aware that this is the kind of food they are sending out,"We also got an extra burrito labeled ""Nathan""",you don't work with us and you did not receive your burrito since it was in our bag,It was literally a bowl of salsa,black beans,and a ton of salsa,One person ordered a salad and there was absolutely NO lettuce on it- just meat,Three people ordered salads ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I spent 15 min in the parking lot trying to ""contact chipotle"" to request refund",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the lady fixing my salad was rude abruptly yelling ""I can't hear you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and my company will no longer be associated with chipotle as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The bags of chips were also pre-made,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food did not taste right,Having Bad chipotle is like having bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Chipotle is located within the Lenox food court,but the quality of food was great,is no longer burnt or dry and had good flavor as well as the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chain always seems to have quick service and quality food which has brought us back for many,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle's food is so good,this is the worst chipotle location I've been too,yet we paid the same) and a general environment of unhappiness made this by far my worst chipotle experience,Inconsistent portion sizes between customers (customer before me was given a decently large guacamole portion while I was given about 65% of what she received,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waiting for the food takes like 6 or 7 minutes not so bad,Well the quesadillas are ok in my opinion the sour cream tastes like yogurt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been eating chipotle for years ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All the food was delicious,I usually get a veggie bowl cause their meat is usually very fatty,but I went with chicken this time ,Food is very fresh and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Expect to pay about $7 per burrito or bowl,but bills can run to to $13 with pricey extras (guac,and beans are the freshest I've ever seen at a restaurant,chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they source their foods (e,Can you get better tex-mex food at a quadrazillion places in Austin,build-your-own tacos and burritos in tastefully minimalist, midcentury modern spaces at highly reasonable prices,quasi-organic chicken) better than any other,and they have vegetarian options (digging the sofritas) that are not a caesar salad or french,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Come to find out they were still cooking the rice ,finally they just started making everyone's orders and telling them to wait for the rice ,and black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Wait in line 15 minutes to find out the do not have 3 of the main things people order including chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hot salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiissssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss my rice was hard,( I had to make it longer bc it said jt was to short to post as a comment the original was just sis my rice was hard so I decided to make sis really long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like chipotle，,cashier was so mean，no smile when I buy a bowl they don't care about you ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was quite disappointed in the chewy stale chips that taste like they were sitting in the fridge,fresh ingredients of Chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those speedy workers are able to churn out burritos,burrito bowls,these delicious meals are nothing more than an upside down burrito bowl with some extra,tacos, lettuce ,"and ""salads"" like it's nobody's business","speaking of ""salads",""" here's a fun fact: even though they call them salads",and salad dressing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but going on a Sunday and getting stale chips and  a burrito so tough,"and 2/3 bags of chips we took ""to go"" were STALE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of food is just okay,This chipotle is crowded ,They were short of grilled veggies and steaks,so I had to wait a bit while waiting on steaks ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sometimes the lines are long but that's what happens when you have good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food ,one employee scratching his head before serving the food with the same,at 10:15 PM they had nothing left and we're not making any more food,They had no white rice,plates in the salad lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asked for a bowl and they didn't have white rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 subway or McDonald's and not to mention we have a small child with severe food allergies,Although this is one of the busier chipotle locations ( it's right,Unless we are on the other side of town we try not visit any other chipotle location,You again chipotle on south,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the new foodcourt,The food prices are the same,We love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle needs to fire everyone ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The employees here always load up on the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like this Chipotle because the line staff and cashiers are friendly and the food is always fantastic,Better than most of the places in a food court,and meats are tender ,The guacamole is fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food is great,it's a nice place to eat with great food,Occasionally you also get someone who does not wrap the burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
given that a lot of fast-food places tend to get rather filthy,I'd recommend picking up food early ,The quality here is consistent,given the horrific quality of most Tex-Mex,What makes it 4-stars is the quality of the service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seems like the chicken always runs out right as I try to order ,At least they have free guacamole now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What a disappointment and so irritating as we wanted to take a night off from cooking and now paid and didn't get our food,Just beans and rice,We ordered a kids meal with steak ,No steak at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food staff either does the typical,Today I have missed feeling because the people preparing my food were great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tonight they announce they're OUT of brown rice,OUT of white rice,and OUT of salad dressing,How are am I going to have a salad with no dressing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" We find the food delicious",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were so nice to all the customers left in the store and the food was better than the chipotles' back home,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location of Chipotle is a terrible experience for those who have had actual Chipotle food from a well-run, I went for some food ,and lettuce on my burrito faster than it came out of my mouth, He almost had the salsa,sour cream,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am in no way complaining about the food,I understand chipotle is a fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is consistently good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The employees were nice enough but the food was awful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was bl,Oh how i miss the chips ,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and food that looks anything ,This is the third time I have been in and they have been out of hard taco shells,This chipotle is nothing short,They definitely don't deserve their restaurantuer status and they are putting the chipotle name to sham,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the absolute worse chipotle in America,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It felt like she was going to go do something gross to my food that I wouldn't be able,Not extra rice as specified etc),try the Brice rd location down the road, I usually get bowls since I am celiac,I wish I had asked that girl to follow me through the line instead of pass my bowl to the next, She went somewhere w my bowl to get lettuce, I got guacamole and chips too ,It seems to have rude lazy staff more often and stale chips,too many messed up or shorted on the guacamole,I'm ok with all the stuff that is spooned out but have to ask for new lettuce since the lettuce is not dished out w,This means that wheat stuff is all over the lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All chipotles are the same,I have eaten at dozens of chipotles ,they pile on the ingredients like nobody's business,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fast and good flavors but the quality of the chicken was terrible-,little bits and pieces and much of it fatty or unknown chicken part, No piece of meat was bigger than a dime, For a salad- not much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 One employee sweeping the floor around the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really disappointed since chipotle normally serves fresh food ,It took me 10 minutes to get home and when I opened my chipotle the guac was already browned,Ordered a chicken bowl with guac ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food at this Chipotle is much like the food at other,One caution though: sometimes they can skimp on some ingredients,Chipotle--delicious as hell,Everything tastes fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really almost want to drive 10-15 mins out of the way just to get better chipotle because I'm literally NEVER satisfied at this one,I've also worked at a chipotle,brown rice is crispy(,black beans ,steak is over cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lady making my burrito then puts the burnt chicken in my burrito ,Add the fact that the fresh chicken guy holds the line up and now my burrito is cold,And I've been to more than a few chipotles,The chicken was black,The gentleman in front of me gets to hold up the line as he waits for fresh chicken to be grilled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
water dripping from the ceiling onto the food assembly area behind the sneeze guard glass - right in between the white,cutting board material and the food bins,Stopped in here last month to get a burrito during the lunch rush,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Close to $10 for a mediocre burrito,Not much meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cold food,the young woman who was fixing my two chicken bowls did not greet me, I asked her for more chicken on one of my bowls since I was getting two of them to go,she attempted to be sarcastic and scooped out a huge amount of sour cream onto my bowl,but not forgetting to mark double chicken on the container,the sour cream was completely out,and sprinted to the back to refill the sour cream, I proceeded up to the register so that I can watch her refill the sour cream,it is out of ingredients, Once I told her what other ingredients I wanted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place his continually going down in service and in food quality,The last time I visited they charged me for two burritos ,This time the brown rice was under cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a veggie burrito ,I bit into my burrito ,and chips , I decided I'd just settle for the chips ,but my chips were stale,and it had meat throughout,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am a huge chipotle fan,I know chipotle is usually on the saltier,Went here to get a bowl on my lunch break,I get at least one bowl a week,The bowl I got from here,Even after skipping on the salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but you roll burritos,and when I ordered my burrito the woman working the line who put it together rolled me the bad,to the point she literally couldn't shut the burrito on any side,She did this with every burrito that she rolled,I asked for a bowl to set the burrito in because the line had built up significantly by this point ,Every single time I go to a chipotle,so I just dumped it into a bowl ,It was oozing sauce and about three times as much sour cream as any rational,I know she realized that she should've paid attention to her portioning because she scooped off some of the sour cream with her gloved,My foil was still completely covered in sauce and sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered my usual burrito chicken bowl,And the amount of rice ,and chicken went in was below than normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came to Austin during the 2018 October water issue and was extremely disappointed that this chipotle was not taking extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle use to be very fast with great food ,due to the employees who are constantly joking around food takes forever ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So as they were left in the cooler all night and pulled out today they had that lovely freeze stink rotting tomato taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food was great,They left the chicken off my daughter's taco kit,the quesadilla hardly had anything on it (just an overpriced tortilla shell with a small, amount of cheese and a tablespoon or two of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm officially done with chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The employees look disgruntled and seem like they could care less what your food looks like,No one wants to bite into a spoonful of sour cream  Location is close to my home but I'm always willing to avoid this one and drive to another to avoid the horrible service and mediocre food,the rice seems old as it sticks together and you verbally have to tell them to remove it and replace it and get your sour cream on the side or it'll be in one large dollop at one end of your burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I appreciate that the food preparer didnt throw a lot of toppings on since I asked for the pico,I had the burrito bowl , I asked for the corn to be on the side and it was put in  a small condiment bowl for me,and salsa to be light,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice was undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you get half the portions of any other chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It comes with rice,salsa ,and some lettuce and Ofcourse the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
.burrito bowl with no beans,white rice,extra chicken,She proceeded to tell me that the chicken ,mild salsa,and MILD salsa were spicy,When I got it home this time  the meat was so spicy,light sour cream and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Have been coming to this chipotle for the past 2-3 years and wasn't that good when I use to go and came back and they did a 360 the line was fast the food was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I work minutes from this location and my team and I have resorted to driving to Hamilton road or Easton Chipotle just to avoid the reoccurring poor service and quality of food we are continually offered by this location,never have brown rice that was not undercooked,if they are not out or rice in general,no chicken,No steak,This location is humorously disconnected from the quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am usually able to eat half of my lunch and save the rest for later but the portion size is so small I ate all of it including chips ,They're serving size are extremely small with each ingredient and they are always out of something especially guacamole,My coworker ordered a salad so I asked for salad,I visited today and was totally annoyed that I had to ask for 5 containers of salad dressing to get a decent,amount of salad dressing for my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No chips several,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Out of sour cream then the measurement of meat was off on my steak bowl,Ran out of steak had to wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I bought a burrito bowl ,Clearly someone didn't want to come to work today and blend the guacamole correctly because I had two big HARD chunks of Avocado and lettuce in my bowl ,and a side of chips ,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would only go again if I'm starving and want to get a large amount of food in a short,burrito was okay ,The tortilla chips were slightly stale,but guacamole costs 2$ extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A few times there has only one person behind the counter making food for the 4-5, The food quality is still CHIPOTLE quality,brown rice,I always get the same thing when I come to Chipotle: chicken bowl,and a great website that shows all their nutritional values (just FYI the chicken has the same,black beans,Didn't have black beans one visit (can't fault them for not getting the shipment though),mild salsa,med or hot salsa, I think they have the best flavor meats,lettuce and side of guacamole,I also think that their guacamole is a lot more liquidy than other, number of calories as the steak,The ONE time I get the steak it is so chewy,cheese,some of the ingredients are low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
steak, They seem to run out of things (cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hovering over the food,A chocolate woman in line quietly asked the woman to keep her dog away from the food,The dog was clearly hovering over the food,#chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food prep,It's so loud they can't hear what you order and become offended when corrected or just blatantly ignore you and then your food is wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ingredients are very fresh,you already know its sooooo delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not my first unsatisfactory visit to this chipotle since I work at the mall,and salsa,Wish there was a sign at the front of the line about them not selling the corn salsa at the moment because that's mainly what I go for,"it was basically just sour cream,meat",I could have probably counted how many romaine sprigs were in my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
None the less they have 2 ppl working the food prep,In the back food prepping the food,Not in the QSR business but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see you need more help and faster employees in the food prep,The food was good,Of 5 ppl behind me that just left to go to Moes around the corner because after 22 min,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pretty good friendly employees delicious kinda upset 5hey made everything a little,the Chicken was spicy like everything else but was juicy and delicious overall,Spicy and very strange taste the queso also didn't stick ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and they had killer chips,I thought the ingredients were all tasty,but it was still a good lime taste despite being a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From the employees working there to be quality of food that I have purchased,Please hire a team of people that care for the food & value its customers,This chipotle by far has the worst service,but chewy steak & chicken that still has fat on it isn't even worth it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And food is always fresh,Only problem is the quantity they serve when it comes to rice ,Do you really want half a scoop of chicken ,and what ever meat is served,That's pretty much what you're paying for is the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it will move fast and you will get good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While the food is more or less the same,I stopped by here today to (1) redeem my free burrito coupon ,There is GREAT service at this chipotle,and (2) treat my family to their first chipotle experience ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lady in front of us had called earlier in the day and spoke to a manager about a wrong order or something like that and the manger was nice enough to offer a free burrito on her next,She instructed her to just say that she spoke to the manager earlier and that she approved the free burrito,just gave her a damn free burrito,I really do hope somebody in their quality department reads these reviews,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every thing tastes as it should,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got the Chicken bowl for lunch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the tacos ,glad for the choices they offer and the price you can not beat,and the salad bowls,The best part is the ingredients are all natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Wonderful staff amd great food,My bowl ripped from some freak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was hooked on the salad bowl,That was until this last Sunday when I ordered a salad bowl with chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I took her to immediate care this morning to confirm food poisoning,She still can't keep fluid or food down,of food poisoning story's that stem from this chain,My daughter and I got a chicken burrito last, night and she opted to have guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their value is incredible because you can always get as much rice ,4-6 scoops of white rice,I always get the double chicken bowl with a tortilla on the side,and beans as you want with no additional,and extra beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was above what I was expecting,I'm not sure what all the 1 star reviews are about- I'm a big fan of Chipotle and I always get a chicken burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mild and medium salsa and got some pretty severe food poisoning from it,"You can say ""you never know exactly who gave you food poisoning"" ",All chipotle locations in Vancouver are very sloppy with their food h,Grabbed a chicken bowl with white rice,black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and how careful and purposeful the employees were in doling out food,I'm guessing the management at this location highly emphasizes giving out as little food as possible,This Chipotle is the stingiest Chipotle on giving ingredients--the only,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I absolutely love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All chipotles have standard portions they give out and the food is always generally the same,These are the smallest portions of food I have ever seen,After visiting here for my third time it is truly the worst chipotle out there,I visit chipotles everywhere ,They will hardly give you a quarter scoop of rice ,and beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm near the market place district so not many healthy food choices ,I believe this is the closest I can get when it comes to health conscious food choices ,the quality of service and food is always a hit ,I love the burrito bowls with brown, rice ,chicken,mild salsa ,lettuce ,corn and lettuce ,corn ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their main items on the menu are burritos ,what else can you get in your burrito),they were out of rice,and bowls ,one type of beans or veggies (now if you are a vegetarian,The staff is not proactive in replenishing ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burrito bowl with white,Worst chipotle experience I have ever had, rice,There was barely any rice in there ,I asked the girl to put more rice ,After putting these 3 items in my bowl ,and pushing it down to the salsa guy I realized my bowl was only half filled,I had to tell him 4 times I wanted more sour cream (which equaled out to the normal amount they put on) I then asked for extra cheese and he proceeded to sprinkle a thin layer or cheese into the bowl,pinto beans,Now comes the salsas,she put a good amount of green chili and corn salsa ,There was barely any in there and a small amount of meat,I asked for sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No more soft corn tortillas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worst chipotle I've been to,Half the time they're out of rice,This time it was rice ,How does a restaurant where rice ,meat or grilled peppers ,coli scare but they're losing me on sucky service and being out of basic ingredients too often,and veggies are common or essential ingredients run out of both at the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I eat chipotle all the time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They didn't wrap my burrito right ,So next time when I go to chipotle and ask for a burrito they better wrap it right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I leave annoyed and get home to see that they didn't even make my food right they forgot sour,I went to this location yesterday 12-9-2018 @ 8pm i ordered a chicken burrito , cream and pico on the burrito ,and a chicken rice bowl the guy charged me $26 YES $26,I questioned it and asked for my receipt he proceeded to say that's the price ,and the bowl,and chicken i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was the absolute worst chipotle I have ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they found a way to destroy the once-amazing limey Chipotle rice,The chicken seems like it went from breasts to wings,more gristle than meat,The guacamole once so good,It now tastes like hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He then goes off on the original kid about how he's giving food away,I asked for steak and chicken in my burrito bowl,I get home and my bowl was great,I pull it out my mouth and it was a sticker from the guacamole(avocado),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight I was there and in line getting food ,they skip with chips which isn't what other chipotle style restaurant would do,They also forgot to give me salsa ,a bit rude that I was asking for salsa,that I ordered and paid for with my chips,Speaking of chips,but others offer free chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food line looks disgusting,The people preparing the food literally moved so slow,The young lady made 2 burritos wrong (she couldn't fold them) proceeded to get a new tortilla and just PLOP the food from the previous,the food quality is really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but i always ask for more to stuff up my burrito so its not really a problem,dr: standard chipotle nothing different,but still tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like undercooked chicken or even the rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I could have braved the drive and went to the Chipotle down on Livingston and high Street but no I had to go to East Broad chipotle,I will never get a bowl from that chipotle ever agai,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get chicken and there was a piece of steak in my taco,I just don't really like this chipotle,The chicken always seems like it's burnt,the chips were beyond salty also,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything from the food to the customer service was great,I have been to this particular location on a few occasions and always leave with fresh warm food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Witnessed a female worker with a large blonde wig preparing food with no Hair-net,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your food will be super,low quality overall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also paid 51 dollars for four burritos ,I will never ever go to chipotle again ,and a bag of chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is decent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food never disappoints,Sometimes it does depend on luck with how much food you get,I'm obsessed with chipotle so what can I say,but chipotle is one of my favorite,Sometimes the servers will skimp out on rice so don't hesitate to ask for a little more rice because they will always give you more if you ask,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Felt a little weird having a young lady making me a carnitas burrito with a Hijab on,Not as good as the burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How hard is it to screw up a chicken salad with extra, cheese,How about NO cheese,and the saddest looking sour cream they could possibly provide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I usually get the burrito bowl with steak ,bring on the burrito bowls," Their red ""hot"" salsa (not really hot",I don't typically eat fast food but Chipotle's meat/veggies are responsibly raised without hormones/chemicals,The ingredients are fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's probably because it's really convenient but literally they barely give any food,This is so disappointing since if I'm going to be charged the full price I expect the full amount of food to be given,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Burrito looks more like a rock than a burrito- ,but thankfully it tasted better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is ok,but I think a food h,walls and table and using the same gloved hand to prepare food,I  just expect to see safer food h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but how hard is it to sling the limited amount of ingredients onto a piece of bread ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle in general,Please chipotle teach your employees how to read,On the last order they forget guacamole that they charge an extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I should have left when I saw the food serving area was an absolute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I gave this location 3 stars because I go here all the time and every time I order they give me so little portion like they went and bought the shit themselves like dang I order extra rice ,and only get a regular portion rice so I can only imagine what the regular,And what's the point of labeling the chips LARGE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and good food,Word of advice: Get the burrito bowl w/ the tortilla on the side if you want a bigger portion as they don't need to wrap the ingredients they're usually serve more,either say it's to go or ask for the lid to the bowl,as you can put everything into the bowl,I don't know how they make simple grilled chicken taste so good,even when I'm sick of chicken at the time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last night I watched the cook grilling raw chicken with bare,Then that same cook turned around and reached into a container of cooked chicken ,I then watched the employees continue to serve the cross contaminated chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customer service and the food were good,My food was cooked ,I like the fact that I can see my food being prepared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hot sauce and cheese (I got both rices ,but this Chipotle was honestly the worst of all of the ones in Columbus I ordered a bowl with chicken,and beans),I didn't like it that much since it had to much hot sauce and they didn't have that many beans :( beans make the meal good,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got the steak bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lettuce yesterday looked old,I am very particular when it comes to lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My tortilla was almost crunchy and the green salsa looked like it was made last,Where were the other ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you're craving chipotle ,Bros always want to give you like 4 grains of rice ,If you ask for more rice they always act like it's coming out of their personal,rice supply that is feeding their starving Gr,Burrito Bro needs that rice for his Gr,I'm getting a vegetarian bowl with no beans,and a slice of chicken,"Guy tonight kept making ""hurry up"" gestures with his hands and saying ""keep going"" while I was in the middle if naming an ingredient",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only do they run out of ingredients they give you tude for asking questions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
move slower than turtles and the food also reflects their attitude,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got food poisoning from the food in my bowl ,I literally had a bowl yesterday ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've dined here 10-12 times and I have consistently delicious food ,so I paid for the chips and salsa with a credit card,I might have received the chIps and salsa for free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My all time favorite food is chipotle,do they think they are giving away food for free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no rice,Everything tasted fresh and well worth the price,Opted for a chicken bowl,extra beans,corn salsa,lettuce and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,If you want the best Chipotle in town go to the Brice/Tussing location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So - 11:35 on a Thursday and you don't have anything other than black lettuce,When I asked for other lettuce,you say it'll take 25 min to make more then proceed to give other lettuce that is STILL BLACK to other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dirty and poor quality food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and decent food,every other things are pretty typical of a chipotle restaurant,Overall I'll stop by whenever I'm in the area and craves chipotle,Apart from you walking on rice,corns ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A good cheap lunch option overall with decent portions and consistent food quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went in for a veggie bowl I think they are short,Waited around 15mins for a bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food at the same,If you have a craving for quick decent burrito or burrito bowl stop here, decent price as other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I requested brown rice ,and they gave me white rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-If you're not food baby hungry,Here are some tips for a better burrito experience from a previous,you can also have your burrito wrapped in TWO tortillas,95) or a single taco ($2,-Even though they ask you if you want black or pinto beans and white or brown rice,even if you order a bowl or a salad,"(So if I say ""half chicken",-Those grilled vegetables for vegetarian entrees can also be added to meat entrees for free,-You can also do this with meats,half steak,""" I'll get charged for steak)",You can always get a big flour tortilla or up to three corn tortillas on the side,But it's still delicious Chipotle crack so of course I'll keep coming back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the guy on register came out to ask everyone if their food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super trash food was cold ,I asked for a little bit of sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have multiple food allergies,They make sure they are as safe as possible with my food ,and ensure that only the person who changed their gloves and washed their hands is the person who takes my food through the whole,since I know dealing with a customer with food allergies can be a pain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I need my carnitas bowl ,Excess lettuce & salsa everywhere,I felt like I was shorted on my meat serving because they were low,I didn't go at the end of night but it seemed like I was there at closing time and they were trying to wrap everything up without refilling sides or meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My vegetarian burrito only has a few,Out of guacamole for the day at 7 pm,and guacamole is key, ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As i waited I observed one employee walking away from the food line (3 times once to walk in the back to bring up more tortilla,When it was time for my food to get prepared,They prepared my food with an attitude,I ordered the Barbacoa bowl,Well I know that is not true because i get it every time I go to Chipotle ( adds more flavor to the bowl),as it's getting prepared I noticed that the meat was dried out ,left off my lettuce that i requested,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cooked fresh chicken ,and made fresh guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fast service with good food, Not sure if the food fairy is always on my side ,I usually stick with the same thing - a burrito bowl,but there's all sorts of options when it comes to burritos,tacos, I was pretty pleased with my bowl ,but the chicken was a bit too salty for me,and salads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we ordered 3 burritos,Don't waste you time with this chipotle ,I had to ask for more rice as I was not given a whole,I asked for extra cheese ,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I only want this food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Probably the nastiest burrito from any Chipotle I've ever been to,Nearly $8 for a small burrito with three unseasoned, ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when I received it didn't have the super greens In the bowl,they just dumped lettuce on top of the meal,Ordered a lifestyle keto salad via door dash,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy food that is pretty good,I don't like spicy food ,hoping that maybe I'll finally acquire the taste for spicy foods,the burrito looks like a football,I like that fact that you can customize your burrito,or taco,bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 bad experiences in a row = a burned chipotle location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
suggesting much better food than what you actually end up with, Nice to have the option of brown rice,not just white rice,which allows you the option of a couple of (very overpriced) menu options not available, No refried beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was in the area & needed to get food so why not here,I waited for the manager to make my food to get home to food with absolutely no flavor,I'm shocked at the extremely poor service & the horrible food,The corn was very hard and not cooked enough and honestly my chicken was not cooked well enough,I have never tasted anything from here that was so bland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Legitimately the worst chipotle I've ever ordered from,Go to any other chipotle in the area save yourself the hassle,Pictured below is a 16 dollar bowl with double, steak double chicken extra, cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No quality control when it comes to food I guess,Stale chips: Took the bag of chips back ,Said it was made for the day - tasted like it was made 1-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I literally have a burrito bowl with  LOTS OF UNCOOKED RICE,The absolutely worst chipotle establishment known to GA,I waited 30 minutes for chips in the middle of the day ,when the store was clearly busy enough to have enough chips prepared,and there were literally 13 chips in my bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
two adults and one kid have food,It's this wimpy ass tortilla with a smidgen of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoy the food however the portion seems smaller ,Overall not my favorite chipotle,and the chicken isn't the best in my opinion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We did not get any food that we had paid for ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food ,one employee scratching his head before serving the food with the same,at 10:15 PM they had nothing left and we're not making any more food,They had no white rice,plates in the salad lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My steak/chicken bowl has been excellent,I wish I could take a bucket of your amazingly delicious chicken home with me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never had an issue with the quality of Chipotle's food before,Ordered a steak burrito bowl for take out this evening,The rice was overcooked ,If this was not take out and I wasn't already home with my bowl,The steak was undercooked,there were exactly 4 strips of lettuce laid across the top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They didn't tell us they were out of sour cream and cheese until we were at the end of the line,Meat was sitting out on the counter and ingredients were everywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As he was deciding what he wanted on top of his steak bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoy the food ,and the paranoia that your burrito will not come out just exactly the way you want,Nowhere can I find that perfect combination of rice ,and meat to end a long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food didn't taste good,I ordered rice with spicy chicken,They were out of cilantro-lime rice,so I had to get brown rice,They were also out of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I order a steak salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Line moves the slowest compared to ANY chipotle I've ever been to,If they ran out of rice I wouldn't be shocked,whether it be salsa,lettuce,One day it tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Left with no food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They used 1  taco sized tortilla for the quesadillas,Rice in bowl was clearly scraped from the bottom ,95 and another one with chicken for $4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Their food has been average,but they finally crossed the line when they attacked my wife while trying to order a burrito bowl for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most recently my Door Dash driver waited over an hour and my food was still not ready,No burrito ,delicious delivery to my door in 30-ish,over the last several months the quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let's talk about the food,like adult baby food,This place is cool because you can put lettuce in your burrito,I used to live in Los Angeles and they never put lettuce on any of the tacos or burritos ,which I guess is practically the case now that chipotle is everywhere,you've got yourself a big bowl of yumminess,which I use to cover the bowl ,And the meat options are amazing because there are so many,I took a spanish class in high school and I'm pretty sure it means something meat,Now I put lettuce on everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also I bit into a plastic object while eating my burrito bowl,The restaurant are out of lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I requested my lettuce be placed on top of my rice ,She proceeded to continue with her attitude as she prepared the rest of my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,depending on managers food (may or may not be fresh,It's best to go especially when they have a catering order because food will stay fresh,They did your food also in the midst of filling catering orders so you are guaranteed to get fresh,food,but you have to pay for chips when you get a bowl,You might as well buy a big bag of Tositos Lime Chips and get more than pay over $2 for a wide brown lunch bag of chips from Chipotle,not just guacamole,more like different cheeses (vegan,cheese),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first time they gave me a burrito instead of a bowl ,I drove back and they made it right by giving me a  bowl ,and the chips tasted like they had been sitting out for multiple,and a new bag of chips(still stale though),I ordered double meat only to get what looks like half of a normal, scoop and a massive amount of sour cream to cover it up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a bowl of brown rice with steak,got less the half a scoop of brown rice ,and 7 fucken pieces of steak,when I got over to pay they charged me for double steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food wasn't bad,and frankly for what you pay for a burrito bowl I would expect to at least have a lot of rice,the cost was 3$ more but finally I was full with just the burrito bowl,I have eaten dine in here a couple of times and I have had to ask for a little more rice ,My solution was get double rice ,The free delivery softened the extra meat price,it barely covered the bottom of the bowl,but it was weird because I was able to actually finish the bowl ,Dining in I can't finish a bowl in one sitting ,but for take out my bowl was a sad,and eat chips ,and double meat,and guacamole,and cheese at the counter ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this chipotle keeps letting me down,They keep forgetting to give me dressing for my salad ,So why didn't they tell me before I ordered my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was really bad,very loudly to remove guacamole before putting it on my bowl, The beans were undercooked, I watched a manager at this location chastise an employee for giving too much guacamole,the employee put guacamole on the spoon , The guacamole had two large,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
especially as the employees openly eat the food as they chop it,When I ordered my bowl,they put RAW CHICKEN on my bowl today,I kindly asked for a whole new bowl ,when I said I would like a completely new bowl with only,they said the chicken was cooked ,To just scoop out the pink parts of the chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on the clock and can't afford to wait forever for my food (that is the point of online ordering,This store was an hour behind on orders so I left without my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are always out of something tonight it was guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would love to explain how the food tastes ,BUT I wasn't able to get any since they didn't have Guacamole or rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I haven't been to Chipotle recently but their  salad bowl did the trick to fill me up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food (especially the hard,THIS chipotle though,cold rice) is less than ideal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a side of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every meat looked like it had a crust on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Usually there are idle employees standing around looking lost or throwing food at each other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This week they are out of chips and tops for bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too many other places to get good food ,The burrito was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,Great chipotle taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm told I have to wait for rice,I just scoop rice ,and chicken,"""we're out of veggies and guacamole ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Honestly was not going to eat chipotle slop today ,Was overcharged for double steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
order of two burritos ,and two bowls was ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I see them messing up on burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food literally tasted HORRIBLE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know they most likely the have a protocol of the amount of serving of the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Honestly walking in I was excited to eat at chipotle ,but the employees were so rude and charged me extra for my sides when every chipotle has never changed me for lettuce ,the chipotle on university would never,and corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Out of food or simply to lazy to go to the back ,and get additional food,Went to order a bowl at 9:40pm tonight,Since half the bowl was missing you would of thought they would offer a free,maybe guacamole (probably out lol),Was told they were out of steak,cheese,lettuce,and corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it is chipotle so obviously it is amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so food is always hot,you should always get some on your burrito,the cilantro-rice is DELICIOUS the way it is made,Always are keeping stalk of sodas and chips,If you go you MUST get some chips, and tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a pickup order and the rice is uncooked,but uncooked rice,Pairs nicely with what looks like day old brown guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food prep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My salad/bowl was half empty, no lettuce in it ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered chips ,35 for the chips ,and a tiny container so for 2 servings of queso and chips I paid ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your food will be cold by the time it reaches you,I would give 0 stars based on the service alone but they get a 3 because the food is still pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I drove 15 mins for cold unsavory food that just threw out after 6 or so bites,I will not be eating chipotle for a couple,Chips were stale and Queso tasted like water and cheese ,I ordered for a pick up and it wasn't even placed on the shelf I had to wait in line to ask the cashier for her to point at it in the corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the smallest burrito ever ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first time I ordered chips ,and queso but they were out if chips,Tonight I ordered chips ,The chips are so stale,They also taste like they've been saturated in lime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband found a piece of medal scrubber in his food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is consistently tasty,I love getting food from here,) chipotle manages to make ordering easy,I love that they are constantly adding new and fun meats/veggie options to the menu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Out of lettuce and rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my food online ,Speaking to me as if I'm begging her for my food,The food wasn't that great,My chicken was burnt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Decided to come to this location at 11am hoping that they would have fresh food ,when they opened as soon as I saw The food it looks cold,more importantly the steak was cold I asked the lady if this was fresh she told me it was and apparently it was not I got my bowl and the rice the steak ,and the beans were all freezing cold I skipped the fajita veggies because they look like mush very disappointing considering they just raised their prices,Was offered another bowl to compensate however I'm already back at work in my lunch breaks don,and hold the race the beans peppers were old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I mean the only thing I hate is when they rush me while I order 3+ bowls ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will never visit this chipotle again,The woman making my bowl moved as slowly as possible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the staff was attentive and helpful and the end was a burrito that was perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle ever,I would rather eat long John silvers then return to this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uncooked rice is something I dislike a lot and burn chicken makes my food experience the worst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As a frequent flyer at chipotle's restaurant chain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know some fast food restaurants are known for skimping out on food,Delicious food,I couldn't even eat my bowl in one sitting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I had cheese on my food that I didn't request, My daughter said her food was ok,My order was the sofritos bowl, My son said his chips were too salty, I didn't receive the sour cream requested,I was just ready for my sour cream lol,and no one answering the phone when I attempted to stop the delivery driver to make sure my sour cream wasn't in the car,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My new Carne Asada steak bowl was not that tender ,I am dreading tomorrow morning when this tough meat starts making its way to my exit,Now a 3rd piece of steak super,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location has been my local chipotle for almost two years since moving to this neighborhood,It's just not worth the price anymore,and the prices they're charging,I have to coach the employees to go heavier on the ingredients because the portions have gotten comically small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food prep wasnt playing with the portions either,Honestly this location gave me a large amount of food ,Another day another chipotle location lol,Big up whitehall chipotle lo,He gave me a mountain of rice lol I had to tell him to take some out,He mindfully put my beans on my rice which I liked,The only draw back was just a small amount of my rice was salty,Most of the time they dont drain the beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chips are old and stale 50% of the time and they run out of food frequently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and for the prices going up ,With that being said every bowl i have gotten in the last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito was fine,I'm to start off with I love chipotle barbacoa meat,Ive never had bad guacamole at a chipotle before so it must just be this location,I asked for light rice ,and got an entire cup of rice,What IS a big deal is that they charge $3 for guacamole ,and then serve old guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can't complain about the food,the guacamole and chips are top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my experience at this chipotle has been AWFUL,I asked why the chips I ordered (,"and I was told with a straight face ""We don't have anymore chips"" (as if that was an acceptable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was food all over the place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food at Chipotle is ALWAYS delicious,I don't know if it's a management issue or a problem of not having enough food ready,but the small portions here don't justify the price of an average,I asked for peppers and got two slices of peppers on my veggie bowl,I ordered a salad and got 5 piece of iceberg lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No guacamole no brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They say it's a standard sized scoop - and I point out that all other chipotles can fit more into a st,I told her - Is it possible that YOUR chipotle is the one that under-serves,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From now on if I want chipotle I wi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This time I ordered online for 7:15pm and had to wait over 40 minutes for my food,It's a burrito so I can't see the inside,sour cream and avocado on my burrito ,waited 40 minutes drove back in the pouring rain only to have to give the burrito to my dog,I get home and these people put lettuce,Come to find out they have all the online orders in the corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
healthy and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also noticed quite a few employees were texting on their phones with their gloves on and then touching the food,Unfortunately this chipotle is not taking the government precautions for wearing mask seriously,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I picked up food from another location ,and was not told they were out of salad dressing until I was checking out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super greens salad is just 90% romaine lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered food from here on Uber Eats that was AN HOUR ,You can't put together precooked food in a timely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
salsa,chips,I've had missing lettuce (ON THE SALAD,I order a salad most times ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but today was literally the worst experience I have ever had at a chipotle or take out food resturant,Coming home with food that was almost inedible,The employees were all over the place when I was the only customer in line and a 2 burrito bowl order that normally takes less than 10 min,Worst chipotle EVER,Literally half way cut up chicken that was dropped in the bowl without care,The chicken wasn't chopped AT ALL,The employee even tried to excuse the large chunk of chicken the size of a normal,chicken thigh,by poking at it with his fingerThe outside of my container was covered in chicken ,and sour cream (I didn't even order) and the chips I had received had to have sat in the to go bags for days,I've worked in the service industry for 7 years and the amount of inefficiency and lack of quality coming from the employees was unacceptable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tortilla chips were fresh,guacamole was fair-,Fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food itself is pretty on par with the others I've been,There is nothing that particularly stands out about this chipotle location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They had no foil tops for the food,I have also never seen the area where the food sits as dirty as it was today,There was steak in the fajitas and food was everywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I give two stars on the food because you really can't mess up the food here,I've also made the mistake of ordering through the many delivery services and they always spend wayyyy too much time waiting at the restaurant for my food,I've received bowls with foil on top,I've also ordered bowls that have shown up completely different,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So 1 hour and 45 min waiting on food,Chicken salad with white rice - turned out to be a brown,rice bowl no lettuce at all,Literally just grabbed a bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Watched as the staff practically counted 5 pieces of the smallest steak to put on the burrito,Usually it's guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And they are nasty wiping counters with their hands then touching food never changing gloves,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food quality had already been on the decline,I put in an online order for a burrito bowl ,and had to throw the entire thing away because they completely disregarded my order and doused it entirely with the hottest salsa (I didn't ask for any of it),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fast-food style restaurant ,tacos (soft,then weather you want beans and rice or onions , or hard shelled) or they can put the fajita in a bowl,You then select the meat - chicken,They are delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,The tables hadn't been cleanes and the floors under the table were filled with trash and food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everybody in front of me were getting huge portions with lids on the bowls barely being able to fit down and burritos about ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food quality you cant fu, The girls could GAF and dont DARE ask for the tortilla that comes with your burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typical chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tierra was beyond generous and extremely accommodating when we asked if we could share a bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today there was no wait and I got three chicken pinto tomato corn lettuce and cheese tacos on a flour,I also got chips and tomato salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've loved chipotle for 10+ years , Not happy and having second thoughts now in returning to chipotle, The salt in the rice was not mixed,the steak had a weird,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As I'm a consumer and pay money for my food,Normally employees at chipotle are very professional,chicken and veggies so I literally watched the gentleman scrape the last scraggly cold pieces onto my bowl,There were a lot of items not stocked like cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
D$@n you chipotle for having good food or I would never come back here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and there were little gnats flying near the food area,They had skimpy portions of the chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't have chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had to ask for extra rice twice ,and still never received a full cup of rice,When it was all finished it looks like a kids meal yet they charged for full price,I ordered chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first time we ordered over the app and the food was cold,All the food we received was overly salted,Not to mention my burrito was completely wrapped wrong so everything fell out as soon as the foil came off,burrito was a mess again,wrong sauces and rice,and for the bowl the veggies they used were  burnt, and left a bad taste in the mouth,I would really like my collection of taste buds back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is sometimes ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food taste like cold,My tacos and burrito were cold,I order from this chipotle,This is the only chipotle I can get delivery from,Every time I get from this chipotle they never follow directions at this point I'm gonna stop ordering from chipotle,period and tell more people not to go to that chipotle or get delivery,I paid for extra meat ,I'm sick of it and nothing has taste to it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Management at this location must either have copied the wrong recipe or they actually believe that adding ridiculous amounts of salt makes food taste better,In the meanwhile I'll have to drive further for another chipotle or suffer a stroke at this one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who thinks it's ok to joke with and play with someone's food,I asked for sour cream light on the sour cream because sometimes they drown your food in it,but the date was 7/03/19 at 8:30 pm also the rice was hard,I asked for lettuce in my bowl,and the meat was dry,I also asked for cheese ,tiny spec of cheese on top that you can barely even see,so they decided to skip the sour cream that I asked for in general,tiny piece of lettuce as you can see in the photo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered online and when I came back into work as I was dipping my chip into the blanco cheese I noticed this long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which I didn't want I just wanted dmy food,It initially started off as a bad review but not because of chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We use the mobile app for ordering and used to always order guac on our burrito/bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never been to a Chipotle that doesn't make your food to order in front of you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do not remember the food, bored teen is feeling take out food deprived,Our food showed up fast,Our food was good,The burrito bowls are enormous,Even though we had my amazing  homemade leftover chicken  ,The guacamole is decent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always at this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consistently good food,Some of the other locations ruin the experience with dry meat or bland rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've had the displeasure of having the same rude older woman make my food on 3 different,smallest burritos I've ever had,Out of chicken,cold and tasteless (just like the staff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk if i came there for food or a fight ,this is by far the worst chipotle,I ordered a veggie bowl that comes with free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who is going to eat  undercooked hard rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually go with the classic burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is delicious,This chipotle isn't stingy on their portions they always give me a good,I used to work at chipotle,there were 2 gloved people on the line and one of them was just standing there bagging chips while the other,You don't stand there and bag chips while there's already some bagged ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I've got say that the rice is what really separates Chipotle from all the other burrito places in town,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
steak and black beans,They had the nerve to be out of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when she got to me simple said "" go ahead "" when it came to any extras I want on my food no smile", I won't be returning the food is great,I work in this area so I come to this chipotle quite often ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
made me wait while they made their own food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I kept seeing new patrons come and order food and walk out before they even started on the mobile pick up orders and there were 4 workers on the assembly line for the burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I shouldn't have to say something to get a normal quantity of food - especially given the bump in prices,If I pay for a bowl,give me a bowl - not half a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:57 and I've witnessed more than at least 20 people walk in to purchase this awesome food ,but when you come and find out they are out of food because they are close,Not cool chipotle my bowl wasn't the same,if you see your out of chips , w/out you're chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have attempted to order online from the chipotle app 3 different,This is ridiculous I will be deleting this app and I will never spend another dime at chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consistently good food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One thing that I've noticed when I go to chipotle is that the service is usually very fast even if there's a line that the people are always pretty polite never rude I've never had a very rude person help me that works there and that the food it's basically the same,almost every way I haven't been to a place where it's two different sometimes it seems like the steak isn't cook the same everywhere and it's chewy and some locations in some locations it taste good but one thing that I have noticed that basically stays the same with every single chipotle that I go to is it the food is never hot,it's never hot sometimes it's warm but it is never hot I have no clue what they're doing But they are not keeping the food hard ,when I go to Freebirds the food is hot,I get the burrito and it's warm to the touch it's hot if I keep my hands on it too long I need to switch it to the other hand when I go to chipotle the food is never hot,if you want it hot you have to put it in the microwave which means I have to ask them to put everything on the side the sour cream the tomatoes anything that I want cold it Hass to go on the side in those little containers and it's annoying and I don't know why they can't do something simple like keep their food ho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 This time I got a chicken burrito,they could up the quality of the chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We did not receive the food until 8:45PM,Came home around 8:55PM and opened the two bowls ,while another bowl missed the 2 MAIN INGREDIENTS: steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had maybe 5 pieces of meat,I asked for extra corn ,and there was barely any corn there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's so hard about it like I wanted cheese not fucking tomato's dumbas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burned rice,Out of steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is by far the worst chipotle I've ever ordered from in my life,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last time they were super rude about fixing it and messed up one of our orders giving a bowl instead of a burrito even though the receipt said burrito,They have missed or messed up something every single time we have ever ordered off the app and it's usually something we pay extra for like guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I opted for the bowl with rice,You put what you want in a bowl,your chicken has a bunch of chewy nasty,chicken,it was a great meal as Chipotle never disappoints except that I kept having to spit out pieces of fat from my chicken,I guess I should be happy to know that they use real chicken breast ,and not some processed chicken mystery meat mixture,black beans ,I guess I should be happy to know that they use real  breast and not some processed  mystery meat mixture,tortilla or salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tomatoes and guacamole,only to find out they were out of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Man took 30min to get a veggies burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can easily park right by the food court as it has its own,The food is just like any other,This isn't the best chipotle , chipotle,I've never seen a chipotle that always a sign about something they ran out of except this one,it's a chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my food on the mobile,I arrived about 5 minutes early and my food was already there waiting for me,I don't understand how my food could have gotten so cold,Today was National Guacamole day so nationally I had order some chipotle with free,I used to be a huge chipotle fan ,Not sure if I'll be going back to New Albany chipotle anytime soon,Last time we ordered my chips were covered in salt that we were unable,guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Asked for more chicken in my bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I believe I was lied to as my food is as cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Very disappointing as I've spent so much money on chipotle over the years, Under cooked rice every time,stingy portions of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asking what you'd like - a burrito,my two burritos were wonderful,or tacos),bowl,Everything was fresh - I even got newly grilled chicken,I witnessed one of the best examples of quality customer service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the entire burrito I found no more then 5 small, pieces of chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who thinks it's ok to joke with and play with someone's food,I asked for sour cream light on the sour cream because sometimes they drown your food in it,but the date was 7/03/19 at 8:30 pm also the rice was hard,I asked for lettuce in my bowl,and the meat was dry,I also asked for cheese ,tiny spec of cheese on top that you can barely even see,so they decided to skip the sour cream that I asked for in general,tiny piece of lettuce as you can see in the photo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The employees are always smiling and friendly and the food is consistently good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Classic chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I shouldn't have to say something to get a normal quantity of food - especially given the bump in prices,If I pay for a bowl,give me a bowl - not half a bowl,stale chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jittery male behind the glass kept dropping food on the side ,and picking it up and putting it in the bowl or back with the rest of the food,those in business would step up and practice proper food h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the bowl leaked all over my car,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food quality is inconsistent,The rice is often undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seriously show some love for the food you are serving,Ruins your whole burrito bowl ,Stale undercooked rice,and the hardest undercooked rice I have had was given to me both times,when you have hard little rice pellets that are barely cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My burrito was filled nicely ,and tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Where else can you get solid fresh food at fast,food prices,you should add it your food rotation,As long as you set your expectations that chipotle is a fast,Just recently started keto and would get chicken salad bowl with fajitas,salsa,cheese ,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So they may have seen my review or something changed got burrito bowl today ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is it just me or has anyone else tried to make their chipotle lime,My dish of choice there is a bowl with white rice, rice at home ,That rice is THEE best,chicken,beans,lots of tomatoes and cheese,but Chipotle happens to be healthy and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sooo I ordered food online at 7:15 got an alert it was ready,to pick up at 7:41 I've been waiting since 7:39 it's now 8:40 and still no food my son is inside I've called no answer this is horrible,by time I get the food it will be 9pm ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I ended up waiting when I finally got my food it was cold,I know food service can be tough,Insanely bad service I waited an hour and a half and couldn't get a refund unless I called and scheduled an appointment with some chipotle bureaucrat over the phone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the second time I have come to chipotle to get food that I've ordered online ,I have small children that I have to come out of the house with to come pick up my food ,and when I get here to find out that they don't even have the food that I've ordered is a huge,So to make matters worse after receiving my food it wasn't even prepared, properly I ordered a burrito bowl that was to have salsa as well as fajita, vegetables and black beans and my bowl only consist of rice lettuce ,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My daughter placed a to-go order and she drove to the location to pick up her food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I've ""reordered"" a steak burrito via the app 6 times in the past",Unfortunately I've received one delicious steak burrito,one sofritas burrito,one chicken burrito that was actually pretty good,one half-sized chicken burrito looked like a kids menu item,guacamole is always good,and two with steak so salty that I couldn't eat it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I drive out of my way to come here because of the amazing staff and the quality of food,They truly look happy to see you coming and always makw my food with care,I came here on chance because the chipotle near my house closed early,I will never go to another chipotle,We eat chipotle two times a week,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only that but a lot of the food tastes completely different,The employees seemed bothered to help and accommodate a decent burrito bowl i am paying $11 for,This chipotle is inconsistent,Just overall interesting chipotle,""" rice",Ordered my bowl ,salsa,steak,almost like the ingredients are off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I could taste the rawness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service is fast and food is always consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is the food,I've eaten chipotle all over the country ,Anyone who has given this place less than four stars has never been to a poorly managed chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For our kid's burrito bowl,but I can't say I'm a fan of the riced cauliflower i paid $2 extra for,My bowl was done right,Instead we got spicy green salsa,One was corn which we didn't get,we ordered just four ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sour cream and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been to several chipotle locations,very stingy on meat meat portions and the rice was undercooked so some of it was a little,other than that guac was fresh and everything else tasted averag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food,The rice was cold,Got a chicken bowl Togo,The chicken was unseasoned,the room where you usually see employees making guacamole,was coming from that back room (the guacamole room),And I got a huge glob of sour cream,it didn't taste like Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was OK,The manager and some other staffs were really unprofessional and dislike when you go there to buy food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible l spent $20 just to get burnt steak this not acceptable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice is hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I settled on the chicken bowl ,they were out of lettuce and guacamole,and it had a good taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I work in food service so I have a certain,I ordered a to go order (literally only 1 burrito) through Uber ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food has always been the chipotle, deliciousness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They gave me someone else's food,my burrito wasn't even wrapped,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't care if anyone's food gets stolen ,If someone takes your food it's your problem not there's even though you have no other,The ordering process isn't even fast through the app had to wait 40 minutes to get food here once ordering mobile,Been to a lot of chipotles ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get home and I am like 5 bites away from finishing my food ,and just so happen to look down at my fork and there was a small green worm CRAWLING on my food,I called the store I got my food from ,I ordered a chicken rice bowl,I don't know whether or not there were more in the bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
brown rice,mild salsa,Add guacamole ,and load up on sour cream,and corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is why they scooped so little food into my bowl,As a result of their sting amount of food I was served,which is why they gave me a tiny portion of rice,because the amount of meat in my bowl was so little,Same for the meat,My favorite topping- cheese,Usually I get lot and lots of cheese,The employees gave me a small sprinkle because cheese is dairy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 But the rest of the food is solid, They charge for their chips and salsa,and sometimes the chips taste like they could use a little more salt, They use fresh ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food taste is superior,and the food is much more satisfying,my favorite burrito joint in the area, to all other area burrito/taco, The portions are larger for the same price,I base this on taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's just a burrito,(or tacos,a bowl,or a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are sloppy,There are only two good things about this place: the location (right in the heart of Davis Square) and the price (it's cheap,"-- I don't get the complaints that it's ""over priced",The ingredients aren't fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I take the food ,the food is leaking through the container they put my food in,causing the food container to fall through ,A huge waste of money and food,If you're going to charge me that much for food,I bought a burrito bowl for lunch today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
salsa just the right,meat cooked just right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Running out of stake or chicken durring a busy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Haven't been through the line a single time when they weren't out of and waiting for at least one particular ingredient to be prepared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was no line and I got my burrito quickly,The server failed to inform me until the very end that guacamole comes free with the veggie burrito (couldn't he have said this before he wrapped it up,The burrito was rather bl,The rice was hard,The medium salsa was lacking flavor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ran in to non of the issues the other reviewers came upon (maybe I just didn't go in to chipotle expecting 5 star dining and super clean I can eat the food off the floor),thats typically a GOOD thing when it comes to food serve,The steak burrito bowl was great,As expected for a chipotle location,The store was as clean as I expect a busy chipotle too be, and ordered nachos and salsa (only real, complaint was the chips were too salty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Recently we've had service so slow that we would have gotten food at a sit down restaurant in the same,I literally am standing in line writing this review and am still not close to getting our food,The last 3 times we have come now they have consistently been out of more than one type of meat ,and we've had to wait a minimum of 10 minutes each time for the meat just to be made (in addition to the long,there was always fresh and fully stocked ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Polaris has more food options then you could ever eat at,They again forgot the rice/beans/chips for the kids meal which I got after asking this time,you should at least understand black or pinto beans,what kind of meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
solid food,burrito,taco or salad,Maybe because you have the freedom and responsibility to make yourself the perfect bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always good,"But this last visit I asked for the ""Veggie taco""",They were out of several things like mild an medium salsa too,Then I was asked what type of meat on it,Told him it was vegetarian so there is no meat on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I expected more considering the price: $23 for 2 for dinner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats a lot of food,If you ever need a chipotle eating partner,- 1 chicken bowl - rice only - with a little,At first you feel like its a bit overpriced,and dip away with guac and my bowl mixture,we were approached by one of the workers who came to our table and took our empty bowls to throw away,bit of every sauce on it - extra corn salsa (that stuff is good,like more chips or salsa,) - guac and chips on the side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First time coming to a chipotle after hearing about queso,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you need some quality tacos fast,The guacamole is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've always loved Chipotle so when they closed for a day and offered free burrito coupons we were all over it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but food quality ,messy ball rather than a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
forgive me my love of infant-sized burritos,chipotle is chipotle,is chipotle,but i usually don't have cash in my pocket so i end up at chipotle just because i,i will defend my preference of chipotle to qdoba to the point of a swift,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I feel like the amount of food you get at Chipotle depends on the person making it for you,it would make the food a lot better,To be honest I'd rather have my food cooked by a Mexican,At least that's why I think they did that image where you have to show it to them and get a free burrito or bowl ,I think I'll just stick to the Sawmill Road location for better taste in burritos ,and bowls,like the fajitas tasted burnt and the chicken was off,Today I got very minimal but the taste was also off too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food,and the burrito was huge,I had a Barbacoa burrito,the burrito was cold,The cheese on on a burrito with warm,I sat in a Chipotle wishing my burrito wasn't as big,rice,beans,The meat was dry,and meat should melt,and it tasted funny,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I absolutely love there food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't know where the water came from enough to wet the bag and had my food dropped on street,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First food court location for Chipotle, I'm there 4 times per week place is always busy and food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chicken at this location is mostly charred,Why even serve chicken ,connective tissue with a little meat in there somewhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is decent,chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My steak burrito was lukewarm ,I know you can't expect all the steak to be fat free but the amount of fatty unchewable steak in my burrito was disgusting, I couldn't even make it through half of my burrito,What really turned me off was the fat on the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice filled peewee football in my mouth today,I just was looking for something else a different salsa to experiment,My expectations walking in the door was deflated when I discovered you had to ask for salsa ,I felt like I put a juicy meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food ,Ordered a burrito,I understand that Chipotle burritos end up being relatively big,in scale yet the burrito wrapper lady did a horrible,If I wanted a burrito bowl,I would've ordered it -- preferably in a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just waiting to hear about another outbreak from dirty handling of food by employees,SLOW service also and when I order a chicken Quesadilla they ask if I want cheese,Doesn't the name imply it comes with cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for brown rice and he almost put 3 grains on my third taco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They're always so friendly here and they always give me extra cheese on my burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We are a family with meat eaters ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the chicken was totally dry,stale chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,sometimes they undercook the rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am currently addicted to their guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A friend warned me to avoid Chipotle's burritos ,"and instead eat a ""Burrito Bowl"" which is a burrito without the tortilla",You will get soggy rice,beans,salsa,covered with your choice of meat,The only thing redeeming about this place is their use of hormone-free meat,If you get steak,pre-shredded cheese,iceberg lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice bowl came with plastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is what you expect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 You either like the food or don't,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Price of three crispy steak tacos + guacamole, These tacos may or may not be enough to count as a full, Order these with guacamole as a side ,The steak has been cold in the evening lately,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it has good food ,and most of the time they have lots of food in stock,Prices are average,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  The food quality does not seem to be what it was a year ago,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so obviously getting Clarissa's food makes no sense,at least double check because god knows I trusted you enough not to open up my food,But only because the chick working the counter is cute and the food is pretty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the Barbacoa and burrito bowls are my favorit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was however my first bad experience with chipotle,it was disappointing to come across burnt veggies in my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very tasty food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chicken bowl is my new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the chips were literally coated in salt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Everyone is very friendly and the food is good,It's nice to finally have a good burrito place in the area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FInally we got our food,We had to return our food,I haven't been to chipotle since then,we ordered chicken bowl,They had ran out of chicken so we had to wait,Half of the chicken was uncooked,I still cant get over that uncooked chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's not often that I leave chipotle still feeling hungry,Don't bother with this location if you want to avoid paying a double portion price just to receive the same,You're practically forced to settle for lots of rice ,just to achieve a regular portion of any ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was honestly disappointed with the food that I received today,Never going to this chipotle again,The worker gave me one scoop of rice,When I ended up eating the rice wasn't cook,It first began when I asked for a bowl,And one scoop of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll stop cheating on you with other burrito joints,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It has delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,the usual good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I hated burritos and Mexican food before I tasted a Chipotle steak burrito, It was enough to get me hooked on gourmet burritos,If you get a burrito bowl,A burrito here is approximately $6 to $7,The rice at Chipotle is what makes Chipotle excel more than Moe's , Chipotle rice is white,rice with lime,which gives it more zest than the standard red Mexican rice at Moe's ,mild salsa,green salsa,hot salsa, Although Chipotle does not provide free chips like its aforementioned, The meats at Chipotle are always tender,cheese,sour cream,lettuce,corn,it does provide very generous servings (you can always ask for more up front if you're not satisfied) and a wider selection of fresh ingredients at no extra,delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Veggie burritos with gobs of black,yummy rice,beans,corn salsa,and yum yum yummy guacamole,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they wouldn't include the guac with it even though another chipotle included it,Their bowls are half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both service and food wise,The burritos are significantly bigger than Anna's,The best burrito you can get here:,rice,black beans,half corn salsa,half hot red salsa,"this is ""non-standard"" (two salsas) ",and I find the meat much more flavorful,cheese,but a few times it's been obvious the ingredients have been sitting out too long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I go here the food is always great,and I get my food quick enough to eat in my lunch break,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56 for one burrito seems a bit steep, If you are into stuffing your face with burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"
food tastes like crap",dog food would taste better,way too much rice in everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I've stopped in the season necessitated there be volleyball moms placing orders for several people and leaving with shopping bags of food,The food tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never felt as if they have served me less meat, I went back in today and tried to pay for it (as well as the salad that I was getting) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and not great food at that,burrito st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always great service and food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is consistently good, if not better (actually I find the chicken to be less fatty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the chicken burrito-all the veggies were fresh,the problem is their chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It makes me wonder why the cashier knows but the people making your food don't,They keep stuffing my burrito bowl so full,I've been to well over a dozen locations over the past half a decade and they all seem to charge what they want to for different items like guacamole or tofu, of everything that by the time I get down toward the guacamole ,they have to crush everything down which sticks the guacamole to the top of the inside of the cover,and lettuce and cheese,I once became a vegan for about 2 1/2 weeks when I saw a gnat in my salad here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and perhaps if i were into more traditional spicy mexican food,If i can i go elsewhere for a burrito,I was disappointed to find that the only mild meat they had was pork (not a big,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As for the actual food itself,I was so disappointed in this visit and the service and the food ,neither burrito was labelled so it was impossible,when I got out to the car and checked my bag I notice I was missing an order of chips ,the chips were seriously stale,and an order of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I love their food, I still enjoy the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I thought that the food gave me the BG's for minute there ,I got a burrito this time ,Normally I get a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burrito bowl & guacamole was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Good food,How can you run out of brown rice or any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I've ever gone the food is cold,Have been to every chipotle in the Boston area ,and honestly this one literally makes chipotle look bad,lettuce isn't even chopped,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is quite good, I get the chicken burrito, The burritos are huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the burrito bowls at this place, I have been to other burrito places (Qdoba) , At work we have many who swear by Anna's burritos,but without getting into that debate I feel that Chipotle is a great burrito place , The best thing is that you can add everything you want aside from the guacamole and still pay the same price, They are also happy to give you extra salsa if you run out,Chipotle claims to use hormone free meats so thats a plus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chicken bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I'm a teacher down the street and everyday I look forward to the familiar faces and consistently excellent food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chips can sometimes be under done ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I come to any chipotle they are pretty,not here I got here no brown rice no chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We arrived at 2:40 and the food was still not ready,My husband then brought the food to the car , When we finally got our food ,My food (chicken bowl) was drenched ,After discovering this my husband called chipotle ,and brought it home we realized the kids order didnt come with kids chips as ordered,I suppose I could munch on my sons chips ,Of course it wasnt there and he had to go back in and ask for the sauce and lettuce we ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also realize you don't need to get a big ole burrito ,and that I can get hard tacos with all my fixings ,and end up with a pretty good steak taco lunch or dinner,I never like rice in my stuff so these made to order tacos hit the spot,Their chips idk why are so salty at every location,The steak is always a bit tough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is Anna's Taqueria a minute away - which is so much better and their guacamole is amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have to say though the dude at the end of the line needs to go back to burrito wrapping school,My burrito ALWAYS falls apart ,not cheap with their meat ,and other ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered chips and salsa and a burrito bowl,and bowl cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
decent sized portions of food,Every other chipotle I have been to gives normal,I asked for double meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you get to watch them prep your food,Too much for lunch in fact -kudos to chipotle for not skimping on portions,Reasonably priced,Fresh slightly spiced chicken over brown or white rice,The rice had a good,"kick to it while being ""rice""",Price was good,Let's start with the chicken bowl,The chicken was hot,black beans,Guac (which was extra) and salsa,I got chips and medium salsa on the side for an additional,I added cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Slowest chipotle ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,there is no other restaurant of its type that you can go to and not suffer from food allergies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food was soOOOooOOo,My husband and I recently moved to the area and we are chipotle fanatics,I had my birthday party at a chipotle once,I'm not sure if it was the chicken or the rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ended up getting tacos with only,beans and rice no meat and no veggie and they charged me the full price for the tacos,I asked the lady why so much If i only got rice ,and beans ,They did not have carnitas wich is the only thing I can eat due to the spiciness of the other meats for my pallat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super yummy food in a great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff is ok however the food quality is terrible,I love chipotle food,This is sad because I really like chipotle but can't eat at this location the staff are just not able to keep things sanitary and food at healthy,Also the chips here where like,Once the meat tastes weird, second was one of the staff was playing in the lettuce with his finger with no gloves just st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I go regularly because the food is great, The set-up was easy and the food was as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Great food that you can expect from chipotle, But how do they pack so many calories into those damn burrito shells,I'll be forced to start eating bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,There it's no way filling up half the bottom bowl is worth,the salsa is spot on,the steak is juicy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they can't wrap a burrito worth a damn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My order was messed up and I was given food that had gone bad,Doug answered my call and immediately offered to remake my food free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food station had almost completely ran out of brown,I love the burrito bowls - their ingredients always taste fresh,they half-assed the BF's burrito wrap,so as he unwrapped the foil the burrito came apart,I love the tacos, rice,but I noticed there was a container ready to go in the kitchen - so I asked for brown rice,so it had to be white rice, and  delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they were out of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another example: with my husband's burrito bowl,(What if you want to hold your burrito bowl close to your heart,they used the inside of the bowl to scrape the guac off the spoon instead of shaking it off,I ended up eating everything in my bowl except for the meat,) And my steak,I love Chipotle for their steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think the standards of food is going down since this was,It was at  4:30 I purchased the food,I always order 3 chicken soft tacos with side on the side so it doesn't get soggy,I'm so upset that Lake Nona chipotle would mess up my order to go,I get home and there's literally 5 price of chicken with crumbs in a tortilla ,and as am eating the lettuce was brown and had lumps of guacamole mixed,(I didn't order guacamole) , in it like old thrown back lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice is flavorless,It's like the Chipotle vegetarian (vegan) bowl takes over my brain,The vegetarian beans are bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really great food as well,I would highly recommend this chipotle,I was new to chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really like the burrito bowls here, They have the choice of brown rice (healthy,but blah) or lime white rice (not healthy, I like both the black and pinto beans, Most people go for black beans,but pinto beans taste pretty good, The salsas are good, I wish they had fresh cilantro and gave out free chips, The corn one is a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If I didn't enjoy their food I would stay away,They are always out of ingredients while people have to wait for them to cut up the chicken or whatever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for my free lunch I got a burrito,I think that they should put baby-tacos on the menu or something,The rice is delicious,the chicken is flavored wonderfully,different levels of spicy salsa,and I just cannot rave enough about their salsa,I love me some salsa,"My first experience I went the ""safe"" way and had a salad that was unimpressive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which overwhelmed other flavors and added to the cold food aspect,and they dumped a huge amount of sour cream on my burrito,This was my worst chipotle experience ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is always great,Wish I got more steak in my bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,my son got a half chicken/half steak burrito,The manager made him a new burrito,and he didn't think the steak tasted quite right, You don't find quality service in fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a chicken burrito,The burrito tasted horrible,compared to other chipotle's I've been to,and a side of guac with chips,The guac was really bland (usually my favorite) and the chips were stale,doesn't mean it's delicious,it tasted slightly sweet,and plain distasteful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos  here are HUGE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank u chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The name of this location should be ""TABLESPOON"" from the rice all the way to the guacamole I watched the employees slowly measure off the smallest possible",scoop of items for my bowl as if saving corn got them a raise,If your hungry then DRIVE PAST this ridiculous location and go to another where they will give a FAIR scoop of options in your bowl or burrit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This McDonald's Owned burrito place is the best I've ever come by Anna's is a close,second and all others just taste plain and dry like a burrito with just rice ,I recommend a chicken burrito with everything on it for those with the big,and beans in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not the biggest fan of burrito's bigger than my stomach,When we got our gigantic burrito,All the ingredients tasted fresh and the rice,I could have just had a bowl of plain rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can literally see that they are really trying to pick up as little food as possible,I ordered a veggie bowl ,I asked for extra corn ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for the mild salsa on my veggie burrito,The make a pretty hefty burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Low prices,Their tortilla chips are a fave,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I literally am not even calling to get free food because I would rather not have to babysit the staf,About a month ago I had started ordering online and after screwing up my order twice and speaking with the management I was given four burritos,It's two simple bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service was quick and the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been coming to this specific Chipotle for the past 3 years and ever since I tried their burrito bowl wi,I'm not a huge fan of burritos,It just feels like a healthy bowl of rice,one time I had to wait a little while longer because they just ran out of rice ,once the contents are presented to me in bowl form,"Here's the ""recipe"" for my routine bowl: Rice",and then they gave me my bowl for free,th chicken,chicken,(no beans),mild salsa,a little medium salsa,and salsa- who can turn that down,and sometimes a dollop of guacamole (costs extra unfortunately),a little cheese,lettuce,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They made recommendations and let me taste food before I ordered it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a shredded beef burrito with the corn salsa ,The burrito was as cold,My DC ordered a grilled steak burrito with mild,wouldn't you know her burrito was about 3-4,and the hot salsa,the corn salsa was super, salsa because she is allergic,times hotter than mine to the point where she had to eat plain tortilla chips in between bites to calm her taste buds,and I have yet to taste anything hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came to Chipotle with high hopes and I can't honestly complain about the food,) seem to matter to my review more as I am not qualified to knowledgeably critique this style of food,the tables were all covered in food ,""" If you have a coupon be sure to check before they make your food",Another thing that irritated me was I had a coupon for buy one - get one for a taco ,"but the manager would not honor it as it was for ""an order of tacos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sometimes they do skimp out on the meat,I just hope and pray I get someone nice enough to give me the right amount of meat I'm paying for,I love the steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I hadn't had Chipotle in months and was really craving it but my burrito was really salty,We think it was the chicken that was the problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great salsas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are always topped off with ingredients ,You can't beat the quality of their offerings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my only delay while ordering during the peak Saturday lunch rush was about 30 seconds when they were diligently cleaning the food prep,area and swapping nearly empty containers for fresh food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks for keeping your ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like Chipotle for the burritos,A regular burrito is 1000 calories,and the meats are tasty,Their steak is usually tender,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
before handling my food,Gloves aren't to protect your hands from food,they are to protect food from your h,With all of the trouble chipotle has experienced with food-born,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll drive the 10 or 15 extra minutes to another location next time I need my chipotle fix,rice was hard,and my lettuce had been soggy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband & I ordered online & his burrito was fine,they gave me more rice than I requested,from the tortilla to the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I generally like other Chipotle's but was not impressed with the food at this location, They ran out of lettuce for the salad bowl so had to use shredded,The salad bowl did not have much, lettuce instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I like to think they give me a little extra meat in my burrito,I ordered my burrito tonight off of my iPhone (an awesome,I always arrive early because I don't want to chance my burrito getting prepared,they apologized for not having my burrito done,He didn't let me leave without throwing a bag of chips in with my burrito,Disclaimer: I feel perfectly okay giving Chipotle 5 stars even though they don't serve an authentic burrito,The issue is that no one out here can make a good burrito (no one can get the mexican,the white rice almost makes it a wrap, rice correct),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As for the food, They double checked with me to confirm my order and asked me if I wanted more of each of the fillings for my burrito,it's Chipotle: massive burritos that taste extremely good, I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of five only because the prices are higher than Chipotle restaurants in other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She was also nice enough to offer me a free meal with chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- who uses white rice for burritos anyway,you best put a few spoonfuls of that bad boy in my damn burrito,08 including tax for ONE friggin' burrito ,Who eats a burrito with a fork,At least they can wrap a burrito ,white rice with parsley (,I got over the price once I sat down,beans,and guacamole (which you have to pay $1,I'm not getting a side of guacamole,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I thought I'd never eat a burrito again,(I believe even their dairy products and beans are organic/no-antibiotics/sustainable,Having recently sworn off corn-fed antibiotic laden meats,hormone and antibiotic-free meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two thumbs up on the food,First and foremost chipotle has good burritos,Almost $13 for one burrito,I can't say I've ever had a bad burrito it wouldn't be my first,Don't get my wrong my review will not solely reflect on the negative attributes of chipotle,and a thumbs down on the price,but the price is just the ultimate,- Price,The price,- Great pita chips,-$2 guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,The server actually scooped one cube of chicken out thinking she put too much,I have to get double meat just to get a reasonable,I  like extra cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is always perfect, And they always give you a lot of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great food ,tends to stare a bit to long at you) but otherwise the food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
crunchy foreign objects in my undercooked beans,chunks of hard fat in my overcooked steak,My theory is that most Chipotle locations don't get enough business to keep their ingredients fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They gave me maybe half the amount in a bowl I would typically get from other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which wouldn't matter if it was because there was too much food in it ,This past time my burrito tore ,I love the brand of chipotle first off,I got more beans than rice ,In even or consistent amounts of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I find Chipotle superior to other burrito places,I remember one time when I hesitated to ask for more rice,the guy behind the counter said to never worry about asking for more rice because he'd be glad,Another instance is when I went and they ran out of chicken ,But is Chipotle delicious anyways,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for double chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
despite the astronomical caloric price of a burrito,I can opt for a more reasonable burrito bowl (,the cilantro lime rice is perfect, But it's trying to be a socially responsible chain by using hormone free meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent burritos,They use all local produce and meats from humane places,the freshest ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they always give you ALOT of food,"no asking ""would you like pinto or black beans""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the only Chipotle in the world that can't figure out that a burrito shouldn't leave your fingers feeling cold ,And they are back to forgetting to thaw their frozen corn or salsa or cheese or something before serving it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every location is consistent with style and taste of their cooking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been to other chipotle places around the country hundreds or thous,This isn't my worst chipotle experience ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the food is always st,I don't care if it's a $30 entree or a $7 burrito,andard chipotle fare,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
open seating area of industrial style tables and booths for eating your burrito bowl or giant,super-stuffed burrito at,He had guac added to his burrito bowl,and there was so much guacamole on his bowl you couldn't see anything beneath it,He literally had a blanket of guacamole and sour cream covering his bowl,A line around the corner moving extremely efficiently,fresh ingredients you can see them preparing behind the front,it always tastes the way Chipotle should ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let alone a burrito joint, The chicken is always flavorful, and juicy and all the meats are of the highest quality,the guacamole is an extra,"Chipotle is one of my favorite ""fast food"" chains for the quality consistency of its products",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered online so it was nice to be able to walk-in and go straight to the cashier and pick up my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food (same,did not give me time to even say 'double meat',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even if food is still good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but this is the third time I've been here and the chips are CONSISTENTLY stal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only one person working the food line,and did not spend a second to slow down and realize she was putting a very small amount of food in my bowl,Suggestions: 1) hire another worker on the food line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 they are very rude and I have even been mocked for asking them to change gloves so as not to contaminate my food with gluten, the food has seemed below par here too lately,this particular chipotle location is the twilight, chipotles are usually really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best food,healthy food,tasty food,delicious food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got the chicken burrito,rice with cilantro is the bomb,Would get the bowl next,The chicken was nicely seasoned,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The taste of the food is average,and cleanliness is a problem here (I've seen people tasting the food where the meat is cooked) , The burrito-builders,at this location seem to have difficulty making a burrito that doesn't rip apart (perhaps that is indicative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They didn't even have tortillas for soft tacos,The guacamole was turning brown ,and the steak was dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I have never waited 20 minutes for my food, I'm used to seeing my entire bowl covered with lettuce ,I didn't bother asking for guacamole because they would have charged me $2 for a teaspoon, The only plus is that the staff were friendly and of course it tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the same amount of money you can go to your local mom and pop taqueria and get a REAL burrito,i don't know why people freak out about chipotle so much,"
rice=bland",pinto beans=not even vegetarian,overall taste=bland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I'd go here for lunch and eat my burrito on the patio, The burritos are huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is just okay now,I can believe it but how does a place that touts fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location makes great burritos like every other,Sometimes my burritos are rolled wacky,I love chipotle, chipotle,And other times they skimp on the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always a fan and food is good,I always get the bowl which is filling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The last couple of times I went here the bar area was quite sloppy and the food was dripped on other,foods during service, The so-called​ vegetarian black beans get plenty of pork bens dripped in them ,The service is also not very attentive and the chips are alternately too salty or not salty ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At this chipotle I feel like they gip you on the food,I usually get my bowl filled in other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered my food earlier via online about 2 hours before pick up time chosen,Only complaint is that the chips were half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
while getting the food she still continued to speak ,She than gave me my receipt and it was as she wanted to just take my food ,I use to work at chipotle at one point ,"The Cashier asked me ""chips or drinks"" I said a drink ",and chips,I waited for a couple seconds for my chips,The chips were also stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not usually a fan of chain fast-food,And their food i consistently good,but their burritos really get me,I'm big on the steak burrito,You can count on the fact that your burrito/taco will be HOT if you want it to (,sometimes worse) burrito establishments,loves their vegi tacos,I love the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was really good,Everyone seemed happy with their food,I love the burrito that i got,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's Chipotle - it's delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so for a burrito or bowl it's a measle,rice,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I recommend the vegetarian burrito with black,but it's kind of not the re-heatable kind of burrito, beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are stingy with the food ,One taco will have an ok,same with the salsa, amount of meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food is always top,It is a steak bowl with brown rice black,medium salsa,We absolutely love the chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While the food tastes good,I've frequent this chipotle for lunches ,a couple times they have undercooked the white rice to where they were still a bit grainy,I paid for extra chicken for my bowl ,I paid for chicken in my kid's quesadilla ,sometimes you got meager portion of the meat even if you order ,AND PAY for extra meat,the consistency of quality is not up-to-par,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food for thought: offer free,Davis/Porter Square is already so laden with burrito joints, guacamole in the burrito,2) Chipotle (close second - salsa's better than Qdoba ,but meat was chewier),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great decor and delicious food,a bowl,Their guacamole is super, Choosing your own ingredients,fresh and delicious too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is serviceable chain Mexican food,your burrito made in about 25 seconds,loaded with the ingedients and put into tacos or burritos,your best bet is to go down to Boca Grande and get a Chicken Colorado burrito or a tamale there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
friendly staff and the food always fresh,my favorite Bowl burrito or the Salad,We all enjoyed as usual and my guest were marveled with such taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's been open over a year and I still have yet to receive a burrito in a burrito shape,What's more concerning is the amount of times I've been given undercooked chicken,I don't eat the chicken anymore,Tastes like meat,It's delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Chipotle and their burrito bowls,I opt for the burrito bowls (,and not the full-on burrito) to save a few,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Found a fly in my food,Don't think I could ever eat chipotle again which is unfortunate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I seem to have an abnormally small mouth which makes eating Chipotle burritos difficult, Then I tried the burrito bowl,& cheese in a burrito bowl, On to the tacos, The tacos worked for a while,black beans,lettuce,but could never get the right taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The portion was very small and for got to place lettuce in one of orders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quality amounts of food (they are all consistently the same,Story time: I had a promotion that expired 1/31 (free burrito if you bought $30 in gift card),We won't take that for this burrito,I leave with my burrito (after threatening to call corporate,They skimp on meats ,and ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Me and my husband order the bowls and he seem already overwhelmed throwing just the food inside the ball as he didn't care,I ask for two kids build your own meal and specifically ask for crispy tacos,A couple minutes passed and steak was ready and he gave me my kids meals with soft tortillas and I said I wanted crispy tacos,when I told him I wanted crispy tacos he rolled his eyes ,Then a Chinese looking guy stepped up and ask me what kind of meat we wanted,I asked for steak,there was no steak ,and he told me I had to choose sometime else because steak was going to take more than 5 min to be ready,but he looked upset because I wanted to wait for the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Essentially one of the largest burritos I've had was right here at this Chipotle,Decent tasting for the price ,but extra for the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is like any other Chipotle - food is consistently great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food always tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They're constantly switching out the food at the bar,I like knowing that the food is fresh,Other days the line will be right out the door and all the tables will be covered in stray straw wrappers and smashed grains of rice,The worst mess you could find here would be stray pieces of rice that have been smashed into the concrete,Just ask for double rice if you'd want more,You can't put a price on that,The kitchen is also open so you can see the employees making the guacamole,Had the steak burn my tongue with it's spiciness,There's been one time where the steak was a little,This place has never done me wrong (Okay maybe once because they didn't give me a lot of steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is always gives you the smallest amount possible,I think this chipotle needs to be looked in to,One thing that bothers me the most is that one day I got fresh chips ,her chips were much like stale,I checked the chips to see if they were fresh,or the imposter chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I guess that they are still having issues with bad food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and affordable prices, Great quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tacos and though they always charge extra for guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their (very large) burrito is a mushy,Barbacoa burrito with guacamole,A bigger problem was the temperature: the salsa ,Chipotle is all about not adding any weird stuff to your meats,and guacamole were ICE COLD,"If this is what ""natural"" tastes like",BUT it should still taste good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is good,I will keep coming back for the food (,Often I go in to find a really long line and only one person working on the burrito line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
brown rice,And then when you ask them for extra rice or chicken of course they charge you extra,If I'm only getting meat and rice,Some locations charge me this price ,shouldn't my bowl only be $4,chicken,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you didn't even have any lettuce to top my tacos,This was twice in the last two weeks that the person behind the counter forgot to put in the black beans into my wife's bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gauc and salsa,meat,but always pissed I still have to pay $9 for only lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really appreciate the fact that you can make your burrito the way you want with extra,prices,The corn salsa is my fav,Barbacoa is succulent and the sour cream is tangy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first one I see in a food court ,and they seem happy at all times if I was 18 again I will work for this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Minus two stars for the bits of gristle in my chicken burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I LOVED me some chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the food portions were small,Our daughter likes corn on her quesadilla so we do that instead of meat usually,asked for extra sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not sure why people feel comfortable dropping rice,beans,After waiting about 3-4 minutes for steak,they gave me cold (like out of the refrigerator cold) steak,cheese,lettuce on the floor ,I haven't been to Chipotle in about a year because I felt like the quality had declined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but there's a lady behind the register most days who never fails to brighten my day and slide a joke in with the food,Chipotle burritos are good,If you're just looking for a standard chicken burrito,I like carnitas in my burritos,but they lack the flavor and extra little kick that you get out of ordering carnitas at most other burrito places,I'm in general a non-enthusiastic but content chipotle fan,and the carnitas at chipotle are a little,kicked this chipotle up from a 3 to a 4 - I don't remember her name,The guac is pretty pricey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've got to admit that I am terribly not pleased with Chipotle quality of food ,One thing that I was suprise was that this place did not offer quesadilla and the chips and salsa had to be purchase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never know Mexican food can be so good,Prefer chicken over beef,Please add the guacamole,every ingredient st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's nice because you can skip the line and your food is usually ready,I go to this chipotle all the time ,I shouldn't have to wait ten min for you to wash and cut lettuce ,when the employees working at the counter knew the lettuce was running low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This particular location can be very inconsistent with the quality of their food,you'll never know if your burrito bowl's going to be amazing,The rice can be perfect,I get minuscule amounts of rice or vegetables,Sometimes their chicken is tender ,sometimes I get good portions of each ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been a couple of times so far and the food has been great,I had quit going to the Semoran location as the food quality had gone down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we will be back to order more food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get one free burritos,I don't personally care for their rice,Their barbacoa is tasty as well as their black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tastier burrito, Not many options and the ingredients are just-OK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is fresh,the prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but this location was stingy with the cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 the food bar is a disaster,guacamole in the lettuce,Tonight it is cheese (Because someone cannot find the blade to shred it) ,corn in sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's because the food is consistently excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Totally un-inspired burritos,The chips are good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service is usually excellent and food is always up to par as well,I love this chipotle in specific,they always have the line moving steadily and never cheat me on the amount of rice,chicken ect,beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vegetarian burrito with two kinds of salsa: corn ,Built on a sturdy base of white rice,When you can fill up on beans ,the black beans meshed perfectly with the addition of bell peppers ,Yay for the bag of chips and the spicy salsa,A sweet topping of guacamole made the wrapped,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went in today to get my favorite burrito bowl, I do believe the person making the burrito bowl is the Restaurant Manager/Owner,He made the vegetarian burrito bowl perfectly, Everyone knows a screwed up burrito bowl can ruin your day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So you either like their food or not,The veggies and the chicken I definitely liked ,She also throws in some free chips an guac,They also have the option to double up on the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wish the dining area was larger-- but that has nothing to do with the food/staff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I go here my food isn't the greatest ,rice,Oh and my brown rice is equivalent,I placed an online order and when i go to eat it its literally just chicken,",cheese ",and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito was ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All of the guys who work here are super friendly and can make a burrito with good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wish they had some vegan protein options as a substitute for meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I recently moved to altamonte after living in Dr Phillips for 8 years and I miss MY chipotle everyday since I've been gone the dry food is only matched by the unprofessional,There is only one Chipotle that gives you the quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
brown rice,black beans,Rotate meat accordingly,free ingredients are a touch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gimmie 3 tacos,My favorite thing there has to be the chili corn salsa,The meat is always fresh,Its a delightfully sweet and spicy mix of corn,as are the other ingredients,Chipotle is still delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food sucks ,It didn't taste good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everyone is loving this craze/trend of customizing your own food (think Piada,I always get my steak bowl with half white and half brown rice,corn salsa,tomato salsa,it's a good idea for me not to get sour cream or cheese,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice ,When I walked up to the counter I noticed they had just a few pieces of steak and a little dried up chicken that had definitely been there for a while,When I asked the young lady if they were going to make any more steak or chicken anytime soon she just replied with a No,and beans also didn't look great, and there was even pieces of lettuce floating in the bean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was able to sample the WONDERFUL Sofritas with brown rice, It is a wonderful meat alternative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is decent,When my food arrived,for the price point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually get burritos,but the tacos I find fantastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They always get my food right,"Nice ""chipotle"" atmosphere",Go see them and get the bowl with the tortilla on the side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But today the staff was not attentive and super stingy on their servings to the point where you can tell that half the burrito bowl was filled by the end,I asked for double the corn ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so if you are looking for a quick burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was always good,and stop making a mess with my food, He would throw rice in my bowl,and slide my bowl down to the other,sling the beans all over the side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food, Stuff and food all over the floor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they barely drain the juice from it and they just dump it on my food,The food assembly seems to either be a careless,mess or just odd portions of food depending on who is making it,So after my food was assembled ,Now as for the food it was mostly okay,You are better off going to the taco Bell,I always avoid chipotle because I'm not the biggest fan due,One thing I hate that Chipotle employees do is when I'm getting mild salsa,she didn't ask if I wanted a drink or chips,then I asked for chips , however the chips we're darn,and the guacamole was the most disgusting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I called one time to confirm how late they were open thinking they might be closed and my daughter was picking up food after work,they were out of chicken ,and steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Usually have to wait for something to finish cooking (it was the chicken this time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On to the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when I went in yesterday to get a burrito,the lady making my burrito utterly changed that for me, Not to mention when I unwrapped my burrito, It's 3 pieces of steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plus chipotle is quick, and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
More often than not the food prep,space is covered in spilled food,I should start off by saying that my husband and I love chipotle so frequent,95 for guacamole ,The ingredient bins are mostly empty,and the employees will try to give you what little bit is left instead of refilling the bin and giving you fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food: I went for lunch ,and got a tasty burrito that could serve a small,not good considering the amount of beans being consumed,I asked for black and got pinto and didn't mention anything about cheese yet received a h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it's also not a lot of food,I'm giving 2 stars because it's cheap and the food is like other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good clean chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quality of food is about the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is chipotle, Quick and good chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I received a coupon for a free burrito in my mailbox, I had a steak burrito with hot,- burrito was huge,50 more than a similar super burrito at Anna's),I'd rather walk two doors down and have an Anna's burrito,- prices were high, salsa ,- salsa was actually hot,- steak was tough,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A man cutting the meats had his hair (long) hanging over the food while he was cutting,and the food tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 For a while I tried to switch over to the burrito bowl,but being the fat dude that I am came running back to the burrito proper,the veggie burrito with the works is almost 900 calories, In the short time that this Chipotle has been open I have won burritos for four twice,price,I don't even want to know what it is if you add meat in,and quality that Chipotle provides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First food court location for Chipotle, I'm there 4 times per week place is always busy and food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I told him if that is their policy then they should also make it policy to hand them out with what they are calling food,he started giving me an issue about me only returning it because of the price,NEWS FLASH if the price was the issue my husb,stating the steak was considered a bowl on its own,The beans looked like a bowl of vomit ,My husband went in to order me a side of steak with beans , and the beans a side item WHY DON'T BEANS COME IN THE BOWL I DIDN'T WANT RICE FOR,and the uniformly cubed chunks of what loosely resembled meat tasted of nothing ,and cheese,and cheese with a lovely,they tasted bl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efficient and I can get a nice amount of protein with some hot salsa,it costs me as much as a sit down place and I have that regretful taste in my stomach afterwards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Also- to the people complaining about the burritos,complain on the basis of taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle gives very small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My son gets a really bare taco with chicken,They gave me both beans and rice with my favorite,lettuce and rice,I've been trying to eat better so I ordered the veggie bowl, salsa verde ,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just once would I like to get a burrito bowl from Davis ,and not worry about getting uncooked rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Look - we're out of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Forgot stuff in kids meal and also ran out of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a place to get a burrito bowl ,and burrito i really like it ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wish they offered brown rice on the menu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and food was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
omg ewwwwwwwwww i h8 chipotle bc its all like,Oh wait: Chipotle is actually fucking delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For the amount of food I received at this location I should have just gone to Wendy's next,The burrito was so small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they always have all their offered ingredients on hand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ingredients they use have always seemed fresher than Anna's to me and in my opinion the burritos,the burritos always taste the same,plus the majority of their meat is antibiotic,Another draw for me about Chipotle is that they try to use as many organic ingredients as possible, taste better because of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best chipotle in Massachusetts,Their ingredients are very fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I LOVE spicy food,My veggie burrito was huge,Not the best burrito in town,There is cilantro in pretty much everything (including the rice,I took one look at the green rice ,when the woman offered to just whip up some cilantro-free rice for me,She then went on to let me know that there was one salsa that lacked the green,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food was fresh,I ripped up my giant burrito tortilla to make mini-tacos and had enough food left over for at least two more meals,I got the burrito bol , and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,Teeny tiny scoop of rice,Small scoop of meat,Maybe two shreds of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I immediately contacted chipotle customer service where they questioned me ,Around 10 am the next day I was sick all day from the bowl I ate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I worked in the restaurant industry for over 5 years so I understand food preparation ,This location doesn't understand how to prep food ahead of time ,This time they were also out of rice as well,This is my 4th time in a row coming here and they are out of chicken,and you will see multiple people waiting around for the chicken to be cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  When asked for a slightly bigger portion of the beans , Extra meat cost me ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the food ,The first two people that prepared my food were helpful,He asked why I didn't want the guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which I really don't like in Mexican food,but you do get a lot of very fresh food,I was sent a coupon for a free burrito from Chipotle in the mail,I sometimes feel like getting a burrito anywhere else is a waste of money, All the ingredients in my and my man's burritos were really fresh,and the burritos,burritos,tacos,they weren't perfect-- I have to subtract 1/2 a star for the use of white rice,and came with a choice of 4 salsas (you have a choice for anything you get, All the salsas we tried were yummy, The chips were fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it's rare in a quick-service restaurant to find freshness and quality predictable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I asked about getting a bowl , The lady putting it together changed her gloves to make my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They keep grabbing from the taco cut romaine,But the taste is def consistently good from other chipotles I've been to,So far I have come to the new location in Lake Nona about 4 times and each and every time they have not had romaine lettuce prepared ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the burrito bowl is h,However the burrito itself packs more calories,a taco (soft,You get rice,Prices are good,beans ,chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get fast service and perfectly delicious burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I have had at least 1000 burritos in the last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Always had a great meal and especially recommend the chips , Just be sure to shack the bag of chips before  opening as the sea salt has probably settled to the bottom of the ba,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is a big deal in this age of highly-processed food,I'm not sure if other Chipotle's have the brown rice available,as I'm hypoglycemic and struggle to find sushi places- let alone Chipotles- that have brown rice,high value price for what you pay for,and guacamole available,I believe the ingredients they use here are from local,I'll always be loyal to Chipotle as long as they keep their local ingredients,quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food is good,but I still like the food so I keep going back,Despite being burned on numerous occasions I go because it's close to work and the chicken is much better than said competitor,chips are stale,I don't think it's cheese,Chipotle has such fresh and good ingredients,I don't care what they say about the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I've never had a problem with this location before today and I felt awful about complaining because people do it to get free food,their customer service is great and their food is usually 100% great, Unfortunately found two short black hairs in my bowl so I'm thinking it came from the guy who put my bowl together ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just bought the biggest burrito bowl of my life for $6,definitely chipotle,and way higher quality stuff than the competitors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was over cooked, and the chips were vary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had a chicken bowl w/ hot,sauce and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The real point of contention was that when my 5 year old was getting a kids taco kit,He then asked for a little bit of cheese,Just give the lad a wee bit o' cheese for fucks sake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had a 30 minute drive and still had to wait 20 minutes for my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 During the meal the zombies either stare at their phone or stare into their burrito, Staff looks up blankly from their ladels of beans only to ask what type you'd like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it would make the food better,I got chicken tacos on corn tortillas,The chicken was somewhat lukewarm/room,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito shell was a ripped on the corner ,Not only was the burrito not closed ,so I left with a half opened burrito,corn ,I get the same ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have seen employees changing trash bags and then switch to handling food using the same,Their service is fast and the food is tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Facts:  Good fresh quality ingredients made in front of you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just visited and literally received a burrito that had half of the tortilla unfilled,I found the rice ,and beans to be so undercooked,You can only ask that add more ingredients once or twice before you suck it up ,The service and quality at the location has really turned poor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And always delicious food,Great chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Good hot food , I grabbed the hard tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burrito bowl & guacamole was good,It tasted bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well I literally came here for the greatness of the burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Didn't disappoint - the rice ,and beans were on-point and the chicken was moist ,and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No Izzy drinks available and the chips were stale,No corn available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The plywood wall still has weird food spatter on it for months,(They served two small half sides of beans  and rice,tried to charge as three full sides at the price of a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,It's not true Mexican in my book but it's yummy and reliable food,you can custom tailor your food however you like,I always wanted to create for the world a burrito chain with great fresh food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have finally come to grips that the service and quality of food here will never be up to par,Come there during dinner rush there somehow always understaffed 30 minutes for a burrito thanks chipotle,I'd rather drive 25 miles outside of Dublin to get chipotle somewhere else,Several occasions come in when they open don't have half the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always have been a fan of chipotle,it's a standard chipotle,Fajita Carnita with plenty of salsa ,and sour cream has never disappointed me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is always good,raw purple onions in the mild salsa,corn salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I have found worse things in food- so I threw the hair away ,this is a ridiculously nasty thing to happen when eating food from a favorite,I spend lots of money at Chipotle and normally enjoy the food,Went in early this afternoon and got a couple burritos , And then I eat part of my chicken burrito back at the house,and finished the burrito,not just the burrito, He went on to say that the store policy was only to refund or replace the one burrito,and the chips have way too much,which is a cut far below others) only complaints I had until now were not enough meat,sometimes the meat tastes funny,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 For $2 I can buy 4 avocados and make a big bowl of guacamole,cheese and meat (basically, We both added guacamole , I don't mind paying the $2 extra for the guacamole because I like it , We both ordered salads and we got very little lettuce,and order it everytime but I would like to taste it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Could this chipotle be anymore prepared,the manager asked me if I wanted chips,We made chips then we ran out ,"and we made chips again then we ran out again"" it was beyond awkward",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not what I expect from chipotle,They skimped on all the fillings and the ones I did get we're dry and tasted kind of old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got all the way back to the office and they put chicken on the vegetarians employees order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go here all the time and the service and food are always great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted pretty good,you get free chips and salsa bar,The quality is equal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is good,but I guess in lieu of burritos everywhere I can only with good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We've not had to wait long for our food,I mean literally 2-3 times a week because this is the only place my daughter will eat a proper meal (kids build your own taco),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go to this location at least 4 times a week and get good service and great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They had to pour my food into a new,But they destroyed my burrito the other, tortilla and I lost some of my ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My daughter's burrito bowl had a hair on it,Top that off with a burrito bowl where the carnitas were colder than the pico, When I took my burrito bowl back to the counter, No offer to make a new bowl, Eat cold meat at your own,grainy taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just have to say I don't think much beats the chicken burrito bowl,I alternate between the cilantro lime rice ,and the brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
healthy food (relatively),recyclable paper food containers (yay)," Your kid gets to choose 3 taco fillings (with ""real"" food choices from the regular",your suspicious kid can see EXACTLY what is going into his/her food ,reasonable prices,rice,Chipotle added brown rice as an alternative to white,rice on the menu, Brown rice at a fast,so much better than the standard fatty cheeeeeeeese quesadillas that most Tex-Mex places throw on the kids' menu alongside the ubiquitous deep fried chicken fingers ,pinto or black beans, menu- diced meats,and not get hung up on the worry that lurking inside might be a stray bit of lettuce,fresh corn relish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can't get past the employees' attitudes long enough to rate Chipoltle's food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I work right around the corner and since I discovered the carnitas salad bowl,it's a great spicy salad ,I would go regularly to Central Market for soup and salad for lunch ,but now I prefer the carnitas salad to a CM salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are gross,and as customizable as the burrito,Unlike the burrito,The tacos,the tacos are actually a reasonable,and overpriced,The guacamole is so salty,there is no flavor and you just want a big glass of water to wash the taste away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordering and customizing your burrito is simple,The ingredients are so fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I tend to get can't-fit-in-burrito portions without even trying to do or order anything special,though: you know how there was that burrito comic,floating around the internet about how making burritos the incorrect,because my burritos always tend to fall apart ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I visited today and got a burrito bowl,They were very stingy with the items even the rice,which I thought was awkward since rice is by far the cheapest ingredient,Needless to say the chicken I was given was very limited,I understand that they run a business but scooping a little more of the ingredients is not going to burn their bottom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never been in here when the prep area wasn't filthy with crusted food,The people putting together your food act like it's a race even ,So not only was it dead and the food prep,area FILTHY but my food was slapped together without any regard for quality,I asked for a little sour cream ,This is more sour cream than anybody would want to eat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was the same,rice,bowl it,add a few chips that seem out of place,meat - wrap it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have finally come to grips that the service and quality of food here will never be up to par,I'd rather drive 25 miles outside of Dublin to get chipotle somewhere else,Several occasions come in when they open don't have half the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The guacamole and corn salsa were obviously not fresh,and the corn was a pale, The corn also had a spoiled taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their chicken fajita burrito with the hot,salsa is just about perfect,"Not crazy ""I need an ambulance""-hot like the Jamaican beef at redbnes around the corner or boring ""americanized bland""-hot like so many other folks' salsa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for double chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is pure utility food,so I was able to drown it in hot sauce and at the very least trick my taste buds into thinking I was eating real food,I asked them to go light on the rice ,I wasn't paying attention and ended up with barely a tablespoon of rice ,I decided on a bowl,and cheese,and a light sprinkle of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Davis Square location is a bit more like the wild west of burrito making (which is appropriate,It's your burrito,If you don't get enough pinto beans,And the flip side of that coin is that you might get way more meat,guacamole,which mixes the ingredients up too much for my taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Normally a bowl will last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I contacted Chipotle about it and they confirmed what I was thinking and subsequently reprimanded the rude staffer who argued with me when I told him that my bowl was not as expensive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but when you have a bunch of folks waiting in line and only one person making burritos it really sucks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always get a good burrito here,It's the usual tasty chipotle burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the burritos/tacos/salads are awesome, Food is a bit pricey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Get the hardshell tacos--they're great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 stars as I thought was a little costly for rice ,and veggie bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality is now what you would expect from a Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even beans and rice,Everyone knows overfilling beans and rice is the easy, way to save money and give us less meat,This location is notorious for skimping on ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not that i go to the meccas of mexican food in the US ,and i thought it would be a good opportunity to check out all the change in our old 'hood and get tasty burritos,and the price of the burritos,i didn't complain because that's basically the price of a veg burrito at anna's (,and this burrito i,later in the night when my boyfriend realized he had no cash it was because his carnitas burrito was EIGHT DOLLARS,WTF kind of burrito i,i suggested to my boyfriend that we try chipotle,i had been to chipotle's before in texas ,and go to freakin chipotle of my own,i don't know if chipotle realizes this or not ,chipotle = sitting outside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My own kitchen would fail a health inspection and I've not gotten food poisoning from them,I'm here out of convenience and a need for a burrito bowl,They seem to overdo it on the rice,There's a reason I always get bowls over anything else ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they made my burrito messy &  ,when I asked for double chicken they didn't give it to me,My girlfriend ordered a chicken quesadilla & we had raw chicken in it,but the manager told us it was steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not the food (the food is always stellar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know there are many other burrito options,do I love my Chipotle burrito bo(w)l with fajita,burrito artist (,black beans,guacamole, veggies (steak since I've been pregnant,and cheese,sour cream,) recommended throwing some lettuce on top of the guac to keep it from sticking to the lid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont want chips and salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Usually I get the burrito bowl at Chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cashier has always been friendly and the food is always on point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
running out of food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 But I'm not crazy about the flavor of the food itself,they charge you extra if you want chips and salsa,Chipotle uses all natural ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All extra fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The place has tasty Mexican food for a good,I like the fact that i have received emails for free burritos ,price,I appreciate their attention to fresh ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I have my usual steak bowl burrito with double, I think they spike their burritos with something that's addictive, rice,no beans,red salsa,cheese ,sour cream,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I like that they have a small menu and that you are able to ensure that your food is prepared correctly each , I stopped eating there because of the lack of the consistency with the flavoring of the chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
simple burritos,or any other burrito place around Boston,just get the bowl of ingredients sans tortilla -- a lot less messy,the salsa,alongside the choice of several delicious salsas,Even the chips are done just right,About eight bucks for a tortilla and healthy serving of chips,Every ingredient is done well -- the meat,Making me go there constantly for its delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have some kind of ethical food policy,A decent and cheap fast food burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when I was there (2 days ago) the ""burrito builder"" forgot to put guac on a customers rolled burrito",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I ordered chips,no chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food that I was served was tasty,I had already planned to get my food to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My recommend is steak or carnitas burrito,Or bowl,It's so delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This time I asked the worker there for a little extra meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
natural ingredients in a fast-food place amazes me,I hate burritos with a passion,I love Chipotle's burritos ,and burrito bowls,No matter the overwhelming number of ingredients I get them to shove into a burrito,The burrito bowls are enough,They are ridiculously big and there is just too much rice ,and too many beans ,but the other half is delicious the next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was tasty,so maybe they did lower the prices,Their chicken option was only $5,I noticed they used WHITE corn,All the Chipotles up in the DMV area use YELLOW corn,But white corn tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like to get the burrito bowl or the salad, bowl because it is a good, I went back last week and thankfully the quality had improved,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service here is super speedy and efficient and I love all of their food (esp since a lot of it is organic, But being the organic food lover that I am, I always get the brown rice burrito bowls here, This is my go-to spot for the burrito bowls , I have to admit though if I wanta  real burrito I do still hit up anna's since it's cheaper ,and salads,I'm impressed by the quality of Chipotle's ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
full-disclosure of ingredients - I asked if their tortillas were vegetarian,taste = 5 stars,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which seems like a silly thing to say about a fast food burrito place,and made sure that his burrito bowl was on the house, The ingredients are great (the steak is medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- the food feels fresh,- the burritos are BIG,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delicious food by friendly,my burrito will come out approximately the same,that burrito will also be delicious,The burritos ,people at a reasonable price,and chips here are damn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food never disappoints ,but food is always nom,and I love love their steaks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The price is not bad for the hugemonous food you are going to get,I've been going to Chipotle for 4 years now (since freshman year) and have ordered the same burrito this whole,I always get a burrito,I always get slices of lemon to squirt on the burrito because it tastes even more yummy,rice,chicken,pinto beans,and cheese,sour cream,corn,and the water tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food quality was good,New chipotle right in the plaza I always end up for gym,It's standard chipotle that's a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By far the best Mexican food anywhere in the Greater Boston area,I am always fond of faster food restaurants with great,fast burritos made with quality ingredients, Chipotle may lack the variety of some other Mexican restaurants--burritos, The burrito-wrapper at the end of the assembly line could have used a little,tacos,cilantro-rice,plentiful salsa ,and chips are the menu,lime chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it really seems like everyone there needs to re-learn how to wrap a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love their veggie salad bowl,black beans,mild salsa,corn salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Manager were nice enough to offer free chips ,i went to the store my salad wasn't ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my burrito heaven has manifested itself in all of its deliciousness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is one of the better chipotles I've ever been to,Good vibes and fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go to a lot of chipotles because it's one of my favorite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I can always rely on good food so because this is where I come the most,They ran out of the vinaigrette and cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Looks like food,Open burrito,Overpriced,Chips & salsa were lame, Why does it taste like cuckarachas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food is very fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but all in all its good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their service is impeccable but if the food is not upto,the past few times ive been here the chicken tasted rancid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love condiments more than I like food -- hot,sauce is a food group to me,I got the barbacoa burrito with the corn salsa ,Anna's is still the #1 burrito spot in town, The rice was spiced nicely,and some hot salsa,the salsa collection is exciting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quality of food is hit or miss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have not had a Chipotle burrito in like,But for a quick delicious American style burrito with tasty,I couldn't even taste my burrito because it was drowned in tabasco, ingredients and non-scary meat (GET THE PORK) you can't beat this place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pretty good as far as chipotle goes,Good stuff - staff member was friendly and accommodating and patient since I havent been to chipotle in years ,Id guess this is probably consistent across all chipotles,The rice was a little,the meats ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I had to stop ordering my food online from this location for this reason,The place is always clean and the staff is nice but if you want to get the food you pay for I'd suggest driving up to the one in Altamonte,It's worth the drive for the right amount of food,I frequent Chipotle between 4-8 times a week and I have to say this location (Apopka) is very stingy when it comes to the meat you get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location is the most stingy chipotle I've ever been to,a half scoop of rice is the default,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The employee making our food sweetly smiled ,We ordered and got our food to go regardless because we hate keeping people past closing,To our surprise the food was hot,New to this area and this will be our go-to chipotle for now on, and delicous when we got home and everything tasted so fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Onions are the devil's food - unless fried or in salsa,""" does for Moe's and a really kcuffing fast burrito does for Anna's Taqueria",I opted for a steak and chicken burrito,cilantro rice,Black beans,She scooped the beans ,hot salsa,Even the bags of chips sitting under hot,green tomatillo and a little cheese,the cheese didn't even melt,I saw/felt/tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was one guy in there eating and one person ahead of me ordering a burrito to go,I ordered corn tacos,Finally she used tinfoil as a barrier and then made the tacos,then she warmed up the corn tortillas without tinfoil so it touched the surface where the flour tortillas touch too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food doesn't seem as up to par with other,I can barely finish my food,they sometimes give me so much rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's pretty sad when u have to pick through your food making sure,I just started to eat a chicken bowl that was ordered on takeout ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is cold,The staff act like children as they jack up your burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always consistent with their food taste ,and quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2) I have yet to eat any Texmex burrito-y type food that I liked,I take back everything I ever said about your food,great food,#2 changed once I got myself a steak burrito at Chipotle,a burrito, I didn't feel ill or heavy after eating one of your massive burritos,This is the first time I've had a burrito that wasn't just passable,I don't know if it's the cilantro rice or what,everything tasted wonderful and good-quality -- color me impressed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this chipotle gives you the least amount of food,Love chipotle ,they didn't both to start my order over (aka my rice,My bowl was nowhere near full,I had to wait about 5 min for the chicken to finish ,beans got cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle ,The standards of chipotle is ruined  at this position,less meat and uncooked chips,half full guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 If you buy food here not only watch your meat to make sure, I went to this one and ordered a burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know it's chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 That being said this location has a friendly staff and is pretty consistent with the quality of the food, The only thing keeping this location from getting 4 or 5 stars are the Dublin soccer moms who insist on ordering 8 burritos to go for their family dinner at 6pm ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality was fine,The volume at the food court at this mall seems rather low,so it makes sense that they don't blow through food as fast as a high,but it was much closer than other Chipotles and my daughter really wanted a Chipotle bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your shit bowl is ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The reason I'll be going to this one from now on is that they give me a FUCK TON OF FOOD in my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered their veggie burrito bowl without beans , That turned it into a fajita bowl, THe corn salsa is slightly sweet,I think their chips are the best in town,the lettuce is never brown ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food quality is also very good,This chipotle has excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was not even hot,I was a big fan of chipotle ,most important the chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 $10 for a bowl , No medium or mild red salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good food,Its the McDonalds of burrito joints,reasonably priced,Trivia Time: Chipotle serves more naturally raised meat than any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not serving food,One half star is deducted for the guy who turned and sneezed in the direction of the chicken being cut up on a cutting board, I'm pretty sure that batch of chicken got sprinkled with sneeze,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the end I went home w/ a card that gave a complete nutritional profile of every menu item & another card for people w/ food allergies & gluten,beans or rice,(Next time I get the BB w/ chicken,he brought me a sample of each of the 4 meats they offer on the line,It's a paid-for extra on the meat versions,the manager took the time to explain the best way to get what I was after: Opt for the Burrito Bowl w/out the corn,"locally sourced ingredients & an option to ""have it your way""",Good quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have had the other two burrito places in Davis--Anna's ,And I love all the salsas ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Couple small burritos left me hungry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 DoorDash is going to show up to get three orders of three chicken tacos,but that sounds like you should give them a total of nine tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a bit pricey for what you're getting ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is our go-to,they give the smallest scoop of meat,and look at you crazy when you ask for a little bit more than 6 cubes of steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 When you get a burrito half the size of what you expected,This place thinks skimping on beans and rice is good,"""You can always ask for extra beans and rice",they still want to charge you full price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Have ordered from here multiple times and every time when I arrive my food is ready,The food is hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This has now totally replaced Anna's for my burrito fix,Like I wanted my burrito with guacamole ,Burritos are a little pricey,but they are huge - the price seems about the same,and the chicken doesn't have those nasty, hard pieces of 'mystery meat' that I always get ,but go here for the really fresh and tasty ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My favorite burrito place in the city,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was finally able to explain the bloating & gas I would have for two days after eating their famous chicken burrito,While I was in line & saw the cook put raw chicken on the grill,the chicken was taken off the grill & diced up put into a warmer container & SERVED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,Like I said great food , I get a veggie burrito ,They act like it's sooooo much trouble to add more beans to the burrito, And a veggie burrito should be less money than the beef burritos ,and ask for more beans since I'm not gettting meat, Especially one lady that works there will only put in one tablespoon of beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the ongoing dumbing down of ethnic foods,"It is the ""Wonder Bread"" of tex-mex food",I tried a barbacoa burrito,The cilantro in the salsa was non-existent and the only consistent taste I got from my burrito was that of the beans ,This is easily one of the worst burritos I have had in recent,I think the only way I would choose to eat a burrito from Chipotle was if someone was offering me one from Taco Bell ,and the tomatoes in the salsa,I asked for guacamole ,I was informed by the menu that the barbacoa is specially spiced and marinated beef of the highest quality,tasteless ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I happily eat the delicious burritos ,"""Yes I'll construct a burrito bigger than your head ",Like every other chipotle location I've been to,and sometimes invites me to delicious member's only,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Pinto beans, Sour cream and cheese,the mild and the corn,SOMETHING in the Chipotle mix that connects with my taste buds in a way that Freebirds never has,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was awesome,it's the food that's the problem,Seriously undercooked meat ,and this last time it had a foul smell to the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I LOVE their chicken bowl,and it always tastes wonderful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So disappointing to come home and realize my food is inedible,they barely fill the bowl up half way, as it's been covered in sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reliable service and consistently well prepared food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typical chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle makes tasty burritos,To get just a small dollop on your burrito, Their guac is delicious and far superior to that of my preferred burrito joint,but Chipotle makes a fine burrito as well - just a little,tacos ,One is the price of their guacamole,they get you hooked on the good stuff and then jack up the price,same rice, overpriced ,very similar chicken (Chip's might be a tad,same (delicious) guacamole,same shredded cheese,same choices of salas including a corn-based,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ingredients appeared very fresh and the resulting burrito was ginormous,chicken,The ingredients are laid out behind the counter so you can decide what to choose like black,I think it's worth another visit and probably just a matter of finding the right combination of ingredients to hit the spot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is pretty much a burrito without the tortilla,$7 for a bowl of lettuce with chicken,I got a chicken salad,The chicken was excellent,beans,as was the chili-corn salsa,and cheese (no sour,on top of romaine lettuce,and the lettuce was really fresh,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not sure why the food here is so pale,Along with my friend's burrito,but it's qdoba over chipotle every single,I had the bowl with white rice,it was pricey at a little,I had to pick some of it out of the bowl,chicken,black beans,I wanted salsa verde ,Not sure if it was her first day there or if she was overwhelmed but she didn't hear me say I wanted salsa verde,I added chips ,The chips ,and guacamole to the order,and guacamole were,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Having worked at chipotle in my earlier years I can appreciate to the full extent their high quality food ,hoping I get a burrito for lunch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh,The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they are very light handed with the food compared to other,But the food is always good,I always get the burrito bowl to go with white,I love chipotle, rice ,I always have to ask for more rice or more steak because my goodness,black beans ,steak ,I always have to ask for moreor more steak because my goodness,and lots of hot sauce and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,I ordered a rice bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always out of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They chop the steak here a lot smaller th,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I used to really like this place - the stuff in their burritos was consistent,But I'm starting to find their burritos extremely salty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 If you don't want to cater to people's food needs,My fiancé has a Terrible dairy allergy and politely asks the person at the salsa end of the counter to change their gloves because of his allergy ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah yeah yeah I love chipotle,cause everyone already knows how good chipotle i,the steak here is always cooked perfectly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and a restaurant I trust having several food allergies,Brown rice,pintos and fresh tomato salsa,with a side of chips,The only thing that could've been better is if the chips were fresher ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
although the lettuce was a little, Fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I ordered steak as my choice of meat ,If you get steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dare I admit to how often I find myself at this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I typically order a burrito,I branched out this visit with a burrito bowl,with extra rice,the rice,chicken,The chicken was superbly seasoned,no beans,I even went so far as to add black beans ,and salsa,I normally shy away from mild salsas as they typically have too much,The corn salsa was also terrific,sour cream and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it felt a bit weird to walk right by my beloved Anna's Taqueria and head into another burrito place, But i was taking advantage of coupon for a free burrito,The ordering process was familiar (how many different ways can you setup a burrito place) ,I went with a pork burrito (a departure from my usual, I was impressed with the salsa quality - i generally don't go with much,and some mild/medium salsas don't offer much in terms of additional, taste - this one did,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When staff were not making food they were all cleaning or organizing things so kudos to management for keeping things running like a well oiled machine,They even got me a refill since there were no customers at that time to make food for,I'm not a health freak but the non-GMO is nice and you'd never know except the food tastes more fresh,Staff seemed genuinely happy to be serving up burritos which was a very pleasant,I had to scrape some off and use it with my chips ,When I asked for sour cream and guacamole they were VERY generous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They gave me both black beans and pinto beans and rice with my favorite,I've been trying to eat better so I ordered the veggie bowl, salsa verde ,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been coming to this chipotle for 4 years ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually order white rice,rice is worth,would be 3 pointer (priced separately) plus guac (priced separately),*not* a chicken bowl with guac,chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If I am staring at you while you make my food you should HOOK IT UP so I am delighted,Watching you while you skimp me on my food doesn't make the grumbling stomach happy,Last 2 times the meat is skimpy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But I assumed a Carnitas burrito had,Or maybe just put carnitas on when they order a carnitas burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never had a problem here with the freshness of the food,I never understood the hype behind their burritos,It wasn't until I left the states and traveled abroad did I realize how bad burritos ,-Normal order is the steak or chicken burrito bowl ,and tacos could be,the corn salsa always has a good, crunch and the meat is cooked perfectly,or the claims that their guacamole was tasty,It might not be but the heavy hand that Willys has on their cheese makes me feel like I'm having a cheese,My only complaint is that this location seems to really skimp on the lettuce,I am forced to emphasize how much shredded lettuce I want,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible food,Food was served with a smile though and that was nice and even with the free guacamole it still wasn't very good,Bland and tasteless for the most part ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they're all the same"" then get some new friends cause they don't know shit about a decent burrito",Barbacoa burrito, Great burrito,extra rice (no beans),salsa (hot,cheese,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my burrito was made like the usual,My burrito broke midway through trying to eat that giant,I guess the burrito become a makeshift,get it as a burrito man,I love chipotle, bowl,I know you aren't going to try and eat it in a bowl with a fork right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Restaurant was very clean customer service was friendly however the food was less than it's normal,I believe someone over seasoned some of the items I'm a regular visitor of this particular store and the food that I got was almost uneatable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went to Chipotle and ordered rice ,and beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So the quintessential attribute in a chipotle burrito is the wrap,the first time I got a burrito ,So subsequent times I'd get a burrito bowl with the tortilla on the side,but I can't help but notice their butchering of other's burritoes - it's usually between wrapping the burrito in a cube form,smashing it so that the burrito is never allowed to be elongated or somehow aggressively wrapping their fingers into the filling of the burrito in order to half-ass conjure some kind of shape they think resembles an edible,I still go here because it's chipotle and you can't mess up a burrito bowl ,But the days I want a burrito - those are terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Surprisingly good food options,"The usual conveyor-belt selection and assembly process with an emphasis on the ""everything but the kitchen sink"" burrito",So don't eat there but do try the tacos,Prices were very good,"but the ""everything"" turned out to include some smoky grilled (or roasted) chicken that was simply terrific",recently-made guacamole that was better than most of the Mexican,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the quality of the food ,Just burritos,and preparation at Chipotle is superior to what I've received at the other two area burrito places,I think Chipotle is far superior in both quality and customer service to other burrito places,the chips have always seemed better ,they do charge quite a bit for guacamole,are the freshest and best-quality ingredients of any of these places,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love that it's clean food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Druid Hills I was hoping to maybe give a little more love to the mission burrito ,the burrito-ista rolled her eyes at me ,go here if you want a quick so-so burrito,until the day I found they do have plain rice ,when I walked into this location and I asked for plain tomatoes and rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  Thought it would get better when they had a little time under their belt as a new location - but no - still oily - oddly colored guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Eight dollars worth of food into the trash, Want a half serving of rice, All they hear is RICE and slam - you got a ton of rice,It's hard to mess up rice ,  I suspect it was the beans because they looked a little milky strange coming out of the serving bowl,and beans , But today I had a Chipotle salad so bad, It was hard to identify what ingredient was the main, It was more than a taste issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a chipotle,You can't really go wrong with chipotle,They ran out of the tofu sofritas so I had chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excellent food ,and priced well below value,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle serves up absolutely delicious burritos ,Would definitely recommend chipotle to anyone,and bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is shredded organic tofu braided with chipotle chilies & aromatic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the portion of food that I got for $9,The food is good,The food looks fresh,I am GF and so I can't have the burritos ,So chipotle is a little,I had the soyfritas in a bowl with rice,Oh yeah pretty much all bowls,I totally forgot the beans though :( ,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the chips were a little, Had some fatty meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also the food was very cold,I'm assuming they made the food a couple min after I ordered so the food was sitting there on the counter for like 30min,Wish they had a way to keep the food warm,I still regretted getting food here tonight,really disappointed :/ they forgot to give me two of my steak tacos,they gave me the tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always finish whatever food is on my plate ,This is not a delusional rant about it not being top quality food,Chipotle needs to start declining in popularity to send a message because it's getting away with some terrible quality food ,Don't know if I've been spoiled by far superior burrito places (read: Cabo Bob's,but I could not eat the last bites of this burrito ,and had to rip off layer after layer of burrito (since it is so underfilled,Go to any other burrito place,and jacked up prices,"Not only was I given a horribly meager portion of ""steak""",I do remember this tortilla quality issue ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
want super quick food,The steak burrito is my usual, No one will be stealing your delicious burrito here I guarantee you that,and want a healthier and higher quality meal than a burger from a McDonalds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you are looking for authentic Mexican food,I usually split the burrito with my boyfriend,but I don't like that they put much more beans than any other, ingredient,and it tastes like that is all it has,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I corrected myself and said I'm comparing your food to the other,We visited over the weekend and I had a vegetarian burrito bowl,The chicken was under spiced,At that point he suggested I tried the steak,it doesn't taste as good,"The vegetables in my portion were stone cold and tasted ""off""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 stars since tastes like normal chipotle at least,Lettuce covered in sour cream like they took it off someone's order ,and put it back in lettuce container (can't eat dairy so gross,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am a huge chipotle fan ,and I have gone to many chipotles,and finally I just went and they had no cheese,third time they had no sour cream,The first time I went they had no salad dressing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is tasty,Although I always order my burrito with steak or chicken,and the prices are just fine,but seeing all these reviews about barbacoa is making me want to go grab my keys and taste it for myself,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So-so to ""Is the gal making my taco in La La L",guac prices going up ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the manager gave us our food for free,Just like any other chipotle,but the manager offers impeccable customer service - I had to wait aside for chicken to be cooked since they ran out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is any restaurant out of food at 6pm on a Saturday (,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they've pulled all the lettuce off the line due,I came in wanting a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The foods are generously served,One of the best chipotle around,Anytime I crave chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My friend said his burrito wasn't as good,Just your average chipotle,My salad was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They don't cut the fat off the steaks they love to give the last of the pans bottom of the barrel food just before flipping there food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff here at this location were always so nice and the food was always good,I came in just before closing one night and they'd ran out of chicken,They actually provided 1 of my orders (and those of other customers) free of charge to compensate for having to wait until they chicken was ready,They stayed open a bit past closing to finish cooking the chicken as well so that I ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seems that I still get too much sodium in my food somehow,Excellent salsas ,All the salsas ,The guacamole is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,but you tell the associates what you want in your burrito ,Each person has specific items that they can put into your burrito,The first person asks if you want a burrito,The bowl is the same as a burrito ,I always get the Barbocoa burrito,unless you are really good and only eat half of the burrito,tacos or salad,Then you choose white or brown rice,with white rice,bowl,Next they ask what type of meat you want: chicken,tomato salsa,roasted chili corn salsa,This combination is a little spicy (the meat and the salsas) ,and if I want to splurge a little I'll get the guacamole (which costs extra),steak,cheese,sour cream,lettuce,and tastes really great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Turns out i have food poisoning  never will i return to this chipotle or probably any other,If i could give this chipotle 0 stars i would, chipotle again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but $12 for a burrito is expensive,If I ask for extra rice,Not that the location directly controls the prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The awfulness of this chipotle never ceases to amaze me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and no issues with the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everyone knows that chipotle is the BUSIEST within its last,"This might be melodramatic but I use my chips as a ""fork"" with my bowl",I get to the cash register and he ask if I would like chips ,He then proceeds to tell me they are out of chips for the night ,and offers me two cards for free chips the next,I'm automatically caught off guard because they don't close for another hour so why they are out of chips FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT is beyond me,So no chips changes the whole,After getting home and being disappointed about having no chips ,and having to dirty up a fork I find that the side of sour cream I asked for is not in the bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food tastes off,People and food are better,support chipotle,tastes old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they tried to charge me $2 extra for having my sour cream and salsa on the side (been doing this for years ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"who instead of a warm greeting and a smile give you a ""what the hell do you want"" look and couldn't give half a shit whether they're providing quality service or preparing a quality product",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you eat lunch here expect to be eating the food from the night before,I know food has a shelf life,And Chipotle prides itself on fresh food,I love chipotle,All the salad and the guacamole is being used,But when you're using guacamole from the day before ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is atrocious,the rice is even crunchy,The chips are always raw,Their meat sits out for hours ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is always hot,and fresh so we are never ordering food sitting out all day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's located in an area with so much potential yet the chips tend to always be stale and the food is cold,I've also known Chipotle to be generous with their bowls ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The amount of meat I was getting was barely over half a scoop ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I won't be back to this location and I'm going to spread the word at the enormous company I work for down the street how nasty the food ,3 crunchy tacos,Also the carnitas on the tacos are dry, meat ,and cheese only,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff is always friendly the restaurant is very clean the food is fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not quite sure why I decided to come back to this location and give them a second chance somethings are just not worthy of that second opportunity and this chipotle is one of them stay far away from here the route staff dry food small,Unfortunately I have to give this chipotle a second,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff are rude and act as if it they cannot give me extra meat on my rice bowl,I understand there may be an up charge (yet I don't agree with considering I only get the rice ,and meat) ,if I ask for extra meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fresh,The young gentleman who started the burrito line was excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I skipped the rice ,My bowl wasn't even half,and beans in my salad because I'm keto,There was more sour cream in my salad than there was lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything was good until I realize I had uncooked riced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I'll swing back by the next time I need a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is wonderful,--portions are great and my burrito is always hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a chicken salad ,and got a total of 6 pieces of lettuce,How does this qualify as a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
com) and on another instance my credit card was charged $80 worth of food that I did not order(through the app someone was able,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice is over cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When you go to Chipotle you know what you're craving and just cant wait to eat your food,I got to the order station and they said they ran out of cilantro rice ,I got to the meat ,I had the smallest portion of the meat I have ever gotten at a Chipotle,and ordered half steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the sloppily thrown together sofritas burrito was unsurprisingly scrumptious,meticulously constructing the tacos at a glacial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My entire bowl was skimpy,At Dublin tonight I saw three men ahead of me and they had heaped bowls,Certainly busy but not good chicken,hardly any chicken,she kept dabbing guacamole so I hardly got any maybe only a $1 worth ,The person I came with said his steak was over cooked,then the cheese I had to ask for more,I had made faces about hardly any lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They told him the system is down and they couldn't serve any food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The rice , The last time even the chips were soggy,and meat (usually go with steak) are usually dried out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the second time i have purchased guac and chips with my burrito to go ,could only imagine how nasty that would have tasted if it was on my burrito,and they forget the chips,Im sure the man in front of me enjoyed the free chips he received on my dime,I get the fajita onions on side because i like to eat those separately and i threw the cup out today because it tasted straight like char broiled grill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I typically order the brown rice with chicken,When we order the cheese quesadilla for our daughter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really good but what happened was that I put the spicy sauce on my burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The guacamole looked old,I have ordered Chipotle delivery before and the guacamole has never arrived this color,Ordered a salad,Basically little to no salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Visit 4: foil for tacos not closed ,Visit 2: long wait and pinto beans were hard,and leaked salsa in my car,Visit 3: grill was not working so only non-grilled meat available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been a couple of times so far and the food has been great,I had quit going to the Semoran location as the food quality had gone down,1/8/17 - Great improvement in speed of service and the food quality is a bit better as well,I always get my food to go ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Prices are responsible,everything was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Lastly the flavor of our bowls were way off ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and they have yet figured out how to wrap a burrito,If it's not the burrito wrap,Since they can't figure out how to wrap a burrito,I have also tried their bowls,Everything else tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's really nice you can get Mexican food ,and so clean and you can get to pick up the food from chipotle ,and you eat the food outside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I always get the chicken burrito with black,the price of a chicken burrito at the super-low, The burritos are also huge,In general prices are really cheap, beans, What converted me from a monastic lifestyle of avoiding restaurants and meat to venturing in here occasionally for lunch was Chipotle's use of naturally-raised animals and increasing use of organic beans, What converted me from a monastic lifestyle of avoiding restaurants and meat to venturing in here occasionally for lunch was Chipotle's use of naturally-raised, and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It appeared literally after I ate chipotle salad,I don't know what it is but with so many controversy of the romaine lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You choose the ingredients you want on your meal so you customize your dish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff did not add extra rice or close to what went into a Burrito either,Don't order a Burrito bowl here-total,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent food without preservatives ,reasonably priced food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Double the prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoyed the plant based option of tofu and black beans with 1/2 portion of brown rice,The price point was also very good,black beans ( no liquid) all three salsas ,and lots of fresh romaine lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Next they fixed my tacos so sloppy,This is the most raggedy chipotle I've visited, The taste was between lackluster,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
specially since my little brother only likes white rice ,and black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been coming to this location since it opened The food was warm,So much so I can imagine them having to scale down to fit the food costs etc,Most of the time the food is barely warm,At first they were overly generous with portion sizing for the meat in their bowls,So when I can clearly see it won't fill one of those tiny cups and ask you to take it out of my bowl ,you have to basically argue with them to even give you a full portion of the meat and the workers argue with you about how it's supposed to be able to fit in one of the tiny cups (that they use for guacamole salsa etc,) you refuse to do so and insist if I'd like more meat I have to pay for the double,meat option,Also on some occasions the meat or veggies can be extremely over salty so use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like the ingredients they have available and usually go for the steak burrito,When I go it's either bc I want quick tacos or to get a big ass burrito(internally laugh watching the person try to roll it),Like a burrito squirrel,Love the salsas they have especially the red,hot sauce along side with the corn salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always good,A great place to get a quick burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another day they forgot to put chicken on my bowl then once I called they said they didn't believe me lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When it started out I wouldn't have gone to a Taco Bell if there was a chipotle anywhere near now it's a tossup,the ingredients do not taste as good,If I were writing this review even a year ago I would be giving this place four stars but I don't know if it's because something happened after that whole salmonella issue in California or if my perception has just changed but I have found that the quality is more lacking, as they used to( quality drop) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was pretty on par with the typical,The ingredients were a bit cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We stopped at this store since its closest to our house and took x2 chicken bowls to go along with iced,that chicken was seriously under seasoned - I really wanted some salt ,the chicken was seriously too salty,Still the good service and their generosity with the servings does go some way to mitigate the blah chicken flavour - ,The service was great and I got good servings of all my requested ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The female staff was in line ordering food ,As if the food is not bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The parking is easy and they have the ""burrito loading zone"" for quick",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not happy with quality and mini portion stake in bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like the food from chipotle, The food is always fresh,Prices are the same but the amount of food is way less then before,The food was good,but super disappointed on the amount of food especially the amount of the cauliflower rice since I paid extra, I don't mind paying for the food ,but if they are going to decrease the amount of food then they need to lower their prices,I got an email from chipotle that they have cauliflower rice for limited,So I did a pick up for a chicken boritto bowl with cauliflower rice,The bowl was half empty and maybe 3 teaspoon full of cauliflower rice,  for the cauliflower rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle in history,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you know what to expect from the food,  Choose your rice,meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is solid, I went to grab silverware and there was a random patron picking up the silverware and wiping them down with chipotle napkins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the burrito I ordered was okay,I was a little bit disappointed with the 2 bags of chips I ordered with my guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Slowest chipotle ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually love going to chipotle ,Planning to not stop by this chipotle again,I was waiting to order and a guy came up to ask what rice I wanted ,My boyfriend ordered a bowl ,Also one worker had shoved her hand into the lettuce for no reason completely destroying my appetite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will never order delivery from this location again- obviously you need to be able to supervise the type of food this location uses in their meals,but I thought maybe they accidentally put some extremely gross and rough steak in the bowl,I ordered chicken,but really burned chicken,I placed a delivery order yesterday evening and couldn't believe the disgusting pieces of meat that came in my salad,I gave it to my friend for him to eat the steak ,but said that he thinks it was actually not steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The veggie burrito is a great,Note: thery still charge extra for guac on a sofritas burrito,The chips are pretty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wished they would have drained all the black bean juice off before they placed it in the bowl,I ordered a Sofritas Burrito Bowl with black beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got food poisoning ,and the steak bowl was expelling from my body,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both from food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bowl wasn't anything special,It cost about $6/7 for the steak bowl ,I was informed they were out of chicken ,the guacamole had an upcharge of roughly 30%,and it cost over $2 for guacamole,I've been in the restaurant industry and understand an up charge for guacamole,I ended up switching to steak because I was tired of waiting after a few, and tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brought the food back to work ,I was very displeased I wasted my whole lunch break driving back and forth and waiting in line for food I ordered an hour ago,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They always season the food great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Blah blah blah it's chipotle I don't like it maybe some people do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Food quality/quantity remains good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Ended up getting food poisoning ,and some sort of infection from whatever kid made the chicken because it was severely undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the single slowest chipotle I have ever been to,Everything else about this Chipotle is what you'd expect from a normal chipotle except the speed,This is the closest chipotle to my house unfortunately so I've been going here steadily for 3 years ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My wife enjoys Chipotle more than Anna's Taqueria (blasphemy to me) but I admit their food is pretty good,I've tried a few burritos and they are just too much food for me to eat in one setting, I got tacos last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you both are implying theres something wrong the food,if the employees here are acting like there is something wrong with the food ,Can you imagine how often something is wrong and they recycle the bad food without telling anyone,I ordered chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it was cut into the big thick chunks which made it hard to swallow especially in a burrito,My friend got it in the bowl , That was by far the worse piece of meat I have ever had there,I'm sure someone was being lazy on this day and didn't cut the meat into a more thin,The commercial indicates how tender and delicious it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a steak burrito bowl for pickup during my lunch,I received my bowl but there was no steak in it and i didn't have time during my lunch break to go back to chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95 Vegetarian burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overall their burritos still taste poor, Most times my burrito was wrapped into more of a cube,and wrapper itself would be oozing with too much salsa , While the meat usually tastes better (less dried out) than the Bedford location,and juice from the meat/corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got the chicken salad bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst wait of any chipotle I've ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and first prize is free burritos for life,I'm gumming away on a Sofritas tofu burrito wondering why Ashley isn't doing open-mic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food ,I tried to submit this info to chipotle's website ,I frequent chipotle ,and service are subpar to chipotle's St,the chicken for the two nights have been Dry ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight I found a piece of plastic in my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Most recently I had a free chips ,the girl checking me out forgot the chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had an excellent burrito yesterday so wanted the same,burrito tortillas,It's a burrito chain ,but you're out of burrito tortillas the second,You need to figure out how to get enough ingredient inventory so you don't lose customers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This has to be the worst chipotle Ive ever been to in my life,With virtually no line he was getting extremely rude with my to the point that he almost closed my bowl without me finishing my order,He started laughing when I asked for a little more corn (as he put 3 pieces of corn),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was a young Hispanic guy working the food line ,throwing food around from one bin to the next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food has massively improved since last,so I always try to get him to make my burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consistently great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food quality ,If I PAY for double meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do like the bowls here,Well the corn salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they should pack the bowls much more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food as always with Chipotle has been delicious,the real manager got on the phone and said if we came back we could have the chips (gee thanks) and a burrito for our trouble,I for one can't believe they'd check the cameras over some chips and two that she then refused to give the girl the free burrito (which was the managers idea,We had 5 people order from here and when we brought it back we noticed 3 of the 5 people didn't get the chips they ordered ,Really checked the cameras over some goddamn chips,and she could see the chips were missed ,we just wanted the chips) over the guacamole,and one didn't get their guacamole,but couldn't confirm the guacamole wasn't put in the bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The inside of this chipotle is definitely smaller than most,and I've never really been a big fan of their chips,I am always stuffed after my meal so chips are never really on my mind,The only time I've been disappointed is when they are out of an ingredient like guac or lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The consistency tasted like s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The protein bowls and burrito were actually solid,the chips were bad,go to Chipotle if you don't order chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've come to this Chipotle location over a dozen times since it opened and will not be coming back until they are able to address items with their food quality,they have the food ready,They also are not shy on giving you a lot of food ,Phillips residents and I know a lot of us were excited to have another nearby option for food, The white rice lacks any flavor,when you order a bowl, They use chicken that is really fatty,the chips were so stale, The steak is consistently overcooked ,you know the taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quality product ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have always been impressed with the service here and the quality of food is what you expect from Chipotle,It's chipotle,Definitely recommend this chipotle over others I've been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I won't go here again cause the food isn't even that good,last couple time so just got tacos ,and it was more like taco soup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is what I was presented with after opening my burrito bowl,I can't tell if this is a fresh bowl,And this AFTER I knocked all the tons of sour cream off the side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70 min before close and they are out of black beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Also they didn't wrap my burrito all the way with the foil ,and the marker on top of the bowl I ordered rubbed off on my burrito while they were in the bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who tries to take food from a baby, We love the concept and food,We hope this is isolated because Apopka is limited with food options, We ordered our usual single taco for our son,rice,beans and, mild salsa, This Chipotle wanted to charge us for the salsa,they over spice their meat making your mouth unbearably hot,since he cannot have cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very unsatisfied with my lackluster burrito :/,What type of chipotle doesn't have guac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I mean chipotles are pretty awful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fresh food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why does your guac taste like soap like did you wash the guac so you can reuse them jeez also the lettuce tasted like peanu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
watched another customer lean over the window to look at food while he ordered,Shame on you after all your other food safety incidents even before COVI,I cancelled my burrito mid-order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$20 for 2 burritos ,"or having to wait forever because they are out of rice """,why would they EVER run out of rice,Burrito with brown rice (that I had to wait for), Good but pricey, specially when you are pissed from waiting forever for some rice,Salsa cheese sour cream and guacamole for $1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got three crunchy tacos,Queso and guacamole with chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh,I really like this chipotle location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always cold,sticky tables and food on the floor,Too bad because I really like chipotle,rice is usually half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came here for the $4 burrito ok,Not to mention the harry potter looking guy doing the MOST saying i could only get a burrito ,when his friend with the attitude told me i could get a bowl ,Then she offers no acknowledgment to my friend not wanting beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am a chipotle lover ,and probably could live with eating chipotle everyday,but for some reason this location usually does not cook their rice all the way,I get the white rice ,and every so often the rice is hard,Cook your rice thoroughly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These days especially I feel mostly agitated walking out of chipotle especially this one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I placed an online order for pick up for a barbacoa burrito bowl,When I got home there was no meat in my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What I don't get is how people don't boycott this restaurant it's horrible they're abusive to the employees and worst of all they are dirty the cross contamination here is out of bounds you can go here and in the first thing you're going to see is how the cheese is in the guac ,and how the Hot sauce is in the sour cream where the customers leave the place extremely messy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Horrible experience  and stomach not happy either now:(  I do love chipotle , We  both got a bowl I ask for chicken ,Finally they give us  our steak we get our bowls happy,so the lady gives me the chicken ,started to eat and the meat was Raw,And please make sure the temperature of the meat is well done ,and half steak ,and scrape 4 or 5 pieces of steak I told her could we wait ,and get some fresh steak,The steak will be done in a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good luck chipotle ,I would also pay extra for guacamole or queso ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The tables and food line were dirty,so I opted to take my food to go,another was chopping meat,One was gnawing on a piece of steak,They were very stingy with all the ingredients for my salad,they didn't hear the cashier's repeated request for the vinaigrette to go with my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They serve frozen guacamole,What more needs to be said when they serve frozen guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can eat a steak burrito bowl with brown,rice nearly every day ,Can't think of another better and more nutritional meal for the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If they can fix the quality of their food,is that the meat is super,Nothing appetizing at all about eating warmed up meat, cold and it doesn't taste fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Was overcharged for food,But If management is poorly trained and don't really care about food quality or customer service I don't see a point of coming to this place in the future,We stop eating the chips and guacamole and continue to eat the burritos had the same,Had to wait for manager to get extra steak bowl that was charged,chips were soggy,she explain that chips are made in the morning only,She offer to bring one more bag of the same soggy chips,new order was the same quality,Guacamole tasted like vinegar,Ate half of it and taste something very bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we didn't want to not take our bowls so we continued to pay for them ,I noticed that they didn't have any guacamole,the originally employee came up to us and felt bad and said we had a good vibe so they gave us a side of guacamole each ,I thought that was pretty derogatory to say to a customer that was disappointed they were out of a certain ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Last week i saw someone preparing food without gloves or a face mask,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The young girl ask what I want on my burrito ,and I tell her chicken ,Finally another lady comes with chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What is Mexican food with out lettuce,At the counter I told the guy making the food I am a vegetarian and I want to have a veggie burrito it took 4 people to get to the end to tell me they have no lettuce ,and that's is the big part of a veggie burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they can't even  put my food that I payed for in a bag that won't rip as soon as I walk out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MY main reason for this review is that my food was COLD,"This is not the first time this has happened and I think it's unacceptable to serve fresh ""off the grill"" food ",I was completely unsatisfied with my food ,I ordered hard tacos,as she  was scooping she accidentally but some in another taco ,but it wasn't a full scoop and if I didn't say anything she wouldn't of put any rice in my 3rd taco,The worker barely put any rice in my dish,My rice ,Which then made the rice hard ,and chicken were both cold,and the chicken tough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tacos are tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's chipotle,The pork with white rice,hot sauce and a bit of sour cream served in a bowl hits it every time,black beans,salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this Chipotle's white rice was a bit undercooked,the rice was still a bit too hard,and the chips,you can just taste a horrid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My wife and I came down with food poisoning after eating at this location on 10/9/15,5 days later food poisoning reports in Oregon start rolling in ,and a month later 6 states across the country have reports of food poisoning linked to Chipotle restaurants , She had a carnitas bowl and I had a carnitas burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
half of our food was cold,One burrito which was two double,meat was the smaller than a normal burrito,This brand new chipotle is in a nice,It's a shame they messed up so much because we get chipotle every week,Two out of three of the bowls had white rice instead of black, and had mixed beans instead of black,beans,two orders had double meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been going here regularly for many years as it's very close to my house and I like the food a lot,I can't trust the handling of my food,I like the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my food nearly fell out of the tortilla,terrible burrito rolling,the chips were also very blan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
missing meat in quesadillas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They always churned out tasty food, We ordered two burritos from this location, The burritos, The beans were kinda tough, The steak was even tough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited 10 minutes as 3 employees worked on 5 burritos for the customer ahead of me ,and starts working on a burrito for herself,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lady working at the end of the line with the toppings was slamming my burrito around ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I heard about it the other day so I had to try it in a burrito bowl,who doesn't want free burritos ,its clumped up more than the kind that's the consistency of taco meat,and other flavors in my bowl, Worked well with the hot salsa,and chips,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I thought overall my burrito was kind of bland- I'm not into spicy food ,I think that Qdoba has better flavored food than Chipotle,My burrito was HUGE,We got a side of somewhat stale chips that were prebagged ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unremarkable in that it is just as good as any other chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is hot,The food is just st,and affordability in a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Literally got a 1/3 scoop of chicken on my chicken burrito,the worst chipotle I've ever been too,The chips where stale,The meat was cold,and asked for more and they tried to up charge me on double meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you want good chipotle go as far as you can from this terrible,The chicken for my bowl was hard,The guacamole was dark,It looked and tasted old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is okay, I like being able to get a bowl, The chips always seem to be stale, The meat is okay, The guacamole is alright,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they were churning out burrito bowls like I've never seen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also have the walk in and pick up your food service,Had a half chicken/steak bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whether food at the location would be discarded,The burrito chain is still trying to overcome a string of six foodborne,The other documented foodborne,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Order is perfect every time with generous portions and fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My colleges and I usually order the salad bowl,larger bowl was ORANGE,Very important to have freshly cut lettuce in that order,The last time we were there the lettuce in the first,Who does quality control in that location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered food to be picked up (8:30pm),Mistake number one was not checking the food,the meat in both her bowl and my burrito was room temperature ,They remade my burrito,This is the worst chipotle I have ever had the misfortune of ordering from,my girlfriends chicken bowl was almost completely empty,It was a bowl with one small,75% of the bowl itself was empty, scoop of chicken,beans ,and guacamole shoved in one end,and quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love coming here because it's one of the cleaner and nicer chipotles in the area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I order a veggie bowl ,Stale chips,and get a teensy scoop of guacamole I can only roll my eyes ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is amazing although some meals you have to put together on your own,Chipotle is a master of combos the food the put together is just right,All the ingredients in this taco seems to work I love all of them,Also chipotle has a good,Also the chips are great,you need to get chips here, it is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All while other customers walk in and get their food before me,Not to mention my food isn't even hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is always in tip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both food ,bowl not full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After watching one of the employees in the store make her own very full burrito bowl for herself,I came home and opened my burrito bowl to find that it was half,I thought they forgot to add the rice,The rice I did manage to find was cold,it wasn't even filled to the edge of the bowl,You have to watch them make your bowl to make sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What rice what beans what meat is that it after each selection,When the conversation was over the lady taking my order seemed like it was such a burden that she had to make my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and fresh foods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I come to this restaurant they are out of guacamole or lettuce or some kind of vegetable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered online and our food was delayed by about 5-10,This chipotle has really large,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They need to get their pick up orders going out the same time as what's on slip or else you're left waiting in the restaurant or you arrive and your foods been sitting up on the shelf getting cold,As I was waiting I was watching everyone make food,Hot tables where food is served from was pretty cross,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband and I always order guac but we weren't gonna order any because we saw that there wasn't any until we saw a worker putting one on a bowl he was prepping after us,We ask for a side of guac and they told us they didn't have any so we said the worker was putting some on a bowl behind us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think this chipotle is a victim of its success - too many,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I've eaten a lot of chipotle in my life ,and today I ordered a bowl that seemed to be about half the size as they normally are, I'm disappointed my orders recently have been much lower quality than they used to be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
customer service is probably the worst of all chipotles I've ever been to,I know the portion sizing and no other chipotle has slacked as bad,Being this is the nearest chipotle to me I sadly have to go there to feed my chipotle,and give the smallest portion of meat, 6-8 pieces of meat,quality over quantity people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but can you stop with the kids plate sized burritos,1/4 cup rice,and mostly all black beans is what they plop down ,a very small amount of corn salsa,we're not adding meat,brown guacamole,cheese,sour cream,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I visit this location there are mistakes with the food,good food,They forgot to put in the rice I asked for,Even with the rice,high prices,I got a bowl,The steak is tender ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She was not even able to wrap another customer's burrito,Was craving this chipotle bowl all day,The girl added one third a spoonful of chicken,she passed it on to a coworker with guacamole oozing out everywhere,and sprinkled literally 6 shreds of lettuce on top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food was completely wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I made an order for Ubereats and the incomplete food they put little on the plate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
arrive in store on time then wait 20 minutes for my food - I could have waited in line twice for the time it took me to get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've spent over $100 in delivery at this location in the past month and in the past 5 times I've had food delivered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they make the meat wayyyy toooo spicy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
consistent food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great service and great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's dirty the people working tonight were awful the young thin dude that was ringing people out yelled an an older man ordering his food,For starts I absolutely love chipotle I am invested in this company especially with stocks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 stars because the food tastes good,Worst chipotle I have ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is ok but I'll probably start going to one further from my house for better service and food they never have enough,They advertise this cauliflower rice ,They also never put lime and salt on their chips so they are pretty plain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered a salad bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fantastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
especially for my favorite chipotle,rice,Instead of barbacoa with everything on it I got sad chicken,and cheese,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But I want to talk about chipotles,wrote chipotle an email by about one ,and had a response from chipotle by the end of the day if not within an hour or two,did chipotle correct it right away,Thanks chipotle,I took this photo because as you can see the order doesn't match what was in the bowl,The bowl was still great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asked for chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
truly making the same bowl and burritos you get anywhere st,I've been coming to this particular Chipotle local for about 3 years now and they consistently have the freshest and warmest ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was suddenly disgusted with my food,While I began eating and was initially enjoying my bowl,I found this attached to the meat,Obviously the person cutting the meat failed to remove this thick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 If there isn't 4x the amount of steak on my bowl ,then clearly we were charged for 2 bowls,This is the same location that runs out of steak, Nothing makes a meal taste bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The meat on both orders and rice (only on one order),The service was great and meal tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as I like spicy food,but both trips the steak and chicken were unusually spicy,and I'm not sure who seasons the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think it helps that they have the second line of food prep off to the side for their online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They get you in and out quick with good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh, and Tabasco is not salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dried up rice from the bottom of the container for my bowl,then put a fresh container of rice for the next,I watched the guy cutting up chicken,then go back to cutting chicken,I asked for pinto beans,"The counter person repeated ""pinto"" then proceeded to put in black beans",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Left over 15min LATER than our time with our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it took almost an hour and a half to get my food,So they were taking online orders and in restaurant orders on the same food line,The line inside became wrapped around the restaurant and people who ordered online were coming in and still waiting 25 to 30 min for their food,They were running out of food ,Terrible service because they are the only chipotle in that area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've worked in the food industry before as well so of course I'm underst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered through DoorDash and the food quality were subpar,The food was ordered around 4pm ,I ordered extra meat ( 2 beef) in one of the burrito bowl ,and the portion was almost the same as my normal 1 meat burrito bowl,My portion size were vastly different to what we usually get when ordered from chipotle,The chips I got was stale also,It almost feel like they're going light on all the toppings from meats to cheese ,Some lettuce were wilted,and lettuce,I love Chipotle because the portion and taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This guy is making a burrito with his nose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While we were waiting we witnessed nasty stuff going on with the food like employees not washing h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Chipotle was my first ever experience with food poisoning,Yall are gon fuck around and KILL someone to start correctly training your staff or preparing food correctly,not an experienced food chain,You guys are disgusting for not properly handling food,then I could've asked my 4 year old nephew to make me some damn chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's hit or miss with service and food quality,the food quality is so atrocious,I've been loyal to chipotle since 2000,00 for rice ,and extra cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 No rice, The server listened to me as I asked for TO GO meal of a veggie bowl,two beans, I also ordered a cheese quesadilla ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
restaurants must provide safe food for their customers,I ordered food on chipotle,The food wasn't ready,"the employee was trying to place food from what it looked like foil container to paper (why ""disturb"" the food layers ",but twice and THEN CONTINUED preparing food with the same,Great food ,properly layered bowl,the employee picked up a bowl from,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bringing his burrito up to $8ish,5) I like burritos,but they're finally getting the idea of what an adequate portion of meat is supposed to be,50 for a little pat of guacamole, I don't LIKE guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whether it be the meat in your burrito (seriously),or your chips and salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seems the fast-food attitude that usually permeates burger places has finally hit Chipotle,Not really your stereotypical chipotle,The perfect mix of rice,chicken,beans,It was like they were trying to save the ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe because we had to dig our hands into everyone's food ,Was supposed to be 5 burritos ,one burrito was missing,Had to literally cut into everyone's burrito ,and 2 bowls in total,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is made with no love ,One of the lowest moral chipotle I have ever visited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The gentleman who was ringing us up proceed to throw our plates of food into the bag,than to have my food thrown at me ,rather than as an entire bowl,seeing as that is clearly not enough to constitute the full cost of a bowl,(2) Extra sides of chicken ,and my colleague asked kindly that the (2) sides of chicken ,and (1) guacamole be rung up separately,throw the sides of guacamole on top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was fantastic,and he had a chicken burrito,It had rice,I had a steak bowl,I will definitely go back for that steak bowl again,black beans,sour cream and guacamole in it,steak,shredded cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is not the first time I have had a less than satisfactory visit to a chipotle restaurant,At first I thought a piece of chicken made it into the cup,I ordered chips ,chips ,The guacamole was the worst part-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with the other food options around,but what makes this is a bad Chipotle is that you get really really little rice,rice,meat,lettuce,the ingredients aren't fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you don't physically watch them make your food they will give you half,Other than that great food,Just disappointed with the lack of care in preparing food if the buyer is not present,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle always has issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So we walked in the same time as the other group and they got their food right away ,and we got our food 20 mins later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even the bowl broke in my h,I ordered a veggie salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came in and saw they have a new cauliflower rice,I should pay $2 extra to get the normal helping of rice,The guy gives me a scrape of the bottom and passes my bowl down (after telling me it's $2 extra,I couldn't even taste it there was so little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unfortunately this is one of chipotles biggest downfall is they hire people that have no business handling food to manage ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they will not create a burrito with sufficient,I even paid for extra meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From the chicken to the barbacoa,The main reason I love Chipotle is because of the way that they season their meats,its all delicious,They should probably hire me as a quality assurance tester,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was not any where close to the chipotle's st, Granted I have been to one in a chipotle in a while but for foodness sake this place would make Brian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chipotle in Windermere is rude,with in the time of her telling me and my brother these things she could've had his bowl done already,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25 and my family gets 4 bowls with it so it's an extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burritos are filling and fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle it's one of my go to's however this location is so slow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
her hair was not neat and it was not in a bun to prevent her hair from getting in the food,you should know when it's time to serve fresh food,I love chipotle, I had asked for a bowl to go and after the line cook added the rice ,and beans,I kindly asked if she could ask the grill to put a double order of medium rare steak for me ( which is one piece of steak),I told her that steak was old,"One employee tried to defend her by saying ""Mexicans eat well done steak"" which is blatantly racist",and such an  idiotic thing to say because i am Mexican American and every Mexican I know doesn't eat well done steak either,And that the steak was only there on the line,So what she is basically telling me is that anybody that wants steak has to suck it up ,and get dried up well done steak,All she needed to do was put down a piece of steak ,The steak that's already dry,especially steak,I wish I would have taken a picture of that steak they were serving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This food portion for price of $9 just cannot he beat,Clean healthy and truly filling food,I don't care about the customer service just give me my chipotle in an appropriate,Chipotle offers a great quality and a great price,I just devoured a delicious bowl from here: Brown Rice,I get the vegetarian bowl so it's a little,Plus a big bowl can be divided into 2 meals if have the discipline for it so it's really an unbeatable,paired with a side of guacamole ,and a side of sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tasty and fresh food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not to busy friendly people stake burrito tests good,clean free refills chips burrito ,The burrito was stuffe,and chips fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we witnessed one of the food prep ladies make a burrito while simultaneously h,anding her unprotected personal cell phone with her food safe,and put it down several times on the food prep counter,as well as all the food h,not to mention the entire food prep,"that's my food"" as she took off her contaminated",I expressed how I was appalled that the other servers on the line continued to put other orders together still serving the same food,I had to practically verbally demand that they pull all the food out , He did finally tell the staff to pull all the food, We finally walked away but after discussing the incident amongst ourselves felt we should return and speak to the manager again and offer to show the video we had taken of the confrontation so he could see how the employee had contaminate the food , The lack of importance that they seemed to share and the other employees not stopping their fellow worker from openly handling her phone and contaminating the food prep, There seems to be a complete lack of food safety awareness ,Bad job Chipotle :-( bad job in training employees in food safety,which is across from the restrooms) we saw the same food server exit the ladies room ,She appeared to be reading an order while making the burrito ,and the entire container of cheese she reached into with her h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Our burrito bowls were really good, and the chips ,and guacamole were fantastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
order a bowl and no rice ,and no steak available then I get home and had corn in my bowl I can't have corn in my diet or it will send me to the ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,I took a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food even has a slight,They may not actually make your food before you get there,the prices are entirely reasonable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The grills were completely clean so no fresh food would be made tonight,I still ordered food,I arrived about 30 mins before closing so there was no line but the white rice was gone ,but of course the prices were about $1 more because it's an airport location,and the meat had been sitting for a while,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but this location has struggled over the past year with their portions and food quality,burrito rolling seems to be a real,challenge for many employees - the last 4 burritos I've ordered have either been leaking at the seams or punctured with holes,The chips are consistently chewy,and I've been served brown guacamole on more than one occasion in the last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was the same,I was still hungry after eating a burrito bowl, as usual and tasted decent ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I consider this a vital component to my burrito bowl,I politely asked the manager if they would throw in guacamole as a substitute,They had no cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I regularly frequent other Chipotle locations and expect the usual ""monster"" size burrito Chipotle is known for",When I politely questioned the staff member preparing my burrito on the portions of rice,and meat he placed inside my burrito,when making the burritos,the spoon was maybe a quarter to half full of the ingredients resulting in a burrito about half the size I've come to expect,full scoops of the rice,small portions at a higher price,beans,meat,- Quality of ingredients,along with poor ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a burrito buffet @ 8 usd would jam all day long,asked how many ounces of meat in a burrito ,free rice is NOT my idea of a restaurant perk,ordered my choices as directed by staff : including cheese as one of my items,get to the table and find no cheese added,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I could see how someone working in food service during SXSW might be a bit discouraged by all drunken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it's the staff preparing the food that leaves a bad,My burrito fell apart as soon as I opened it ,The ingredients are fresh,and they are very stingy with the ingredients, taste in my mouth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As much as I love my burritos ,But after recently dining at this location I can definitely say I will not be coming back to this location again any time soon nor will I be in the mood for a burrito in a long,As much as I love burritos,Most establishments I've been to everything was clean and fully stocked but here the rice,There was also a long strand of hair in the bowl of white rice,and chips to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like Mexican food ,but guacamole was mediocre ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my tacos today were everything I've been missing in my life,because the less work I have to do for tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lettuce here is more like mulch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delicious food,I like the explosion of online ordering options being offered by fast-food places,Part of the appeal of ordering ahead is coming in to pick up your food,Sometimes I'm in the mood for some rice/meat/vegetables,Imagine my dissatisfaction when I was forced to substitute a less expensive meat for an order I already paid for because the website was not accurate,Taco Bell has a bigger menu with more ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The staff will make or break the food experience ,the food is piping hot,rice,consistent beans,meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They never have all ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steak bowl is my all time favorite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a chic burrito,So a burrito by itself was freakin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was the last in line and due to them not having all the food out I got a free, drink and my meal was half the price it should have been,I would recommend them to cook the chicken a little, longer since one of the pieces tasted undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the food here,That's why I always order my food in a bowl,Most of them don't know how to roll a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 food tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  Love the burritos ,  Salsa and chips is a good,and salads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But I'll take good food over comfortable,The burrito bowl was enough for 2 adults to share for lunch,and price at this Chipotle is on par with the one I frequent in Raleigh,The quality,and the taste was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Same food as elsewhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I can see six employees and only one is making food for a line of 6 of us st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll save my Mexican food for another place,The burrito that I ordered was made so sloppy,This was my first time ever at chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But something was off with the food because my stomach started churning one hour after I finished my food,I ordered chicken tacos with white, rice,cheese,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's usually a rush and they portion of the food tends to be less than regular,this is definitely the place to go to get a quick delicious meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great value from the typical inexpensive airport food, The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Price could be better but the food is yummy,I always order burrito salads,steak and cheese and black beans and brown rice with veggies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Given Chipotles's troubles late last year I thought I'd take the risk and buy a burrito that I normally enjoyed,The chicken was over cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great location right off the freeway and the food was fresh,Be of my all time favorite chipotle,and clean chipotles I've ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is fine,Edit: The advantage to long waits are that you generally get more in your burrito/bowl,I would say that I'm the target demographic for chipotle,standard chipotle dishes ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stale and over salted chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was very very cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the food is always great,They hooked up the veggie bowl everything looked very clean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Online orders shouldn't be waiting for food to be made,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food ,The Guacamole and lime chips always Fresh (my fav,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So happy to see a chipotle at the Atlanta airport,Guac is free with a veggie bowl,We even received a free bag of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fine,left over crumbs of food all over the tables, Do yourself a favor and get your food to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yesterday they were out of white rice,This time they were out of tomato salsa,no chips,no cheese,8/21/16 and they were out of sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only thing good was that they made portions on our bowls big,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
flavorful food always,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also think it sucks that they lied about their food being non-GMO,I effing love their burrito bowls,I love that they cook their rice with cilantro,People want guac and they don't want to pay more than the price of an avocado for a few,do you really care about the hormones and genetic modifications being pumped into your meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I couldn't figure out how I would eat a burrito waiting on my flight so I ordered a bowl,It would be nice if they served the burritos in a bowl for travelers since everything is to go ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a shame as I would like to eat here more often yet cannot wait 30 min for a burrito bowl,Dear chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ok im a chef for 21 years and must of the time i would love to get food from another people ,Look the only thing i can say is that people have to get better education on food,You supposed to do the best i get the steak burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Besides the food being delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This particular Chipotle deserves accolades for consistently making tastier burritos than any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The guy who wrapped my burrito wrapped it weird so literally ALL of the guacamole was on one end,completely ruining my burrito,I had to take the whole burrito apart because the first,2 inches of burrito were guacamole, The staff jipped me on a lot of the ingredients (salsa,and guacamole),sour cream,  and sour cream ONLY,but the ingredients weren't even very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My son is fussy and wanted his tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is consistently delicious,Their burrito bowl is my go-to,I went to chipotle 3 times a week after journalism class,I eat at this chipotle every day for lunch with my coworkers,This chipotle,I miss my drunk chipotle :,chicken,Double black beans,Chipotle makes routine awesome and delicious,.delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always super good food (as with every chipotle) ,Whenever we walked in she would immediately start our food before we even got to the front,My boyfriend and I would come to this chipotle once a week essentially ,great chipotle location ,and they always seem to let their hand slip with a little extra meat and rice,She even paid for 4 customers plates once because the cashier was taking too long in the bathroom and paid for my meal once because they put sour cream on i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't get as much food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or know I will not have time or access to food later in the evening,They will take your order in line and let you pay via credit card before you ever get to submit your order to the person who makes your food,chips or any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and still had to wait 30 minutes for my food,AND they were outta chips to top it off which I had already prepaid for ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the price wasn't too bad,I thought the Burrito was great and tasted fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is all cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And they always have my food ready,I ADORE chipotle,But if you order online keep in mind they will ALWAYS forget your chips,I've done this four times and every time they forget my chips,So just remind them when you arrive that you asked for chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not because of the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The girl putting the salsas on the food asked if a salad dressing was mine,The burrito line staff was rude,and made it seem like them having to make my burrito was a burden to them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came in wanting a burrito,but find that they are somehow out of the burrito tortillas,the meats were on the cool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really like chipotle but the person who makes the burritos is terrible,Get the bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Extremely tasty and healthy Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Love the burrito bowls ,I now smell like pinto beans ,I felt a bit rushed by the salsa lady ,and holy guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instead they yelled for the guy in the back to come out and make the food,Then after we paid the cashier didnt bother handing us our food,She just said yeah you can take your food,So we had to reach across a three foot long counter to gather all of our foods,chips ,It was all the way on the inside of the counter close to the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was as good,They could not hear anything we were trying to order and ended up giving me some lettuce tacos,as any other chipotle , instead of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is been on my list as a foodie enthusiast to try it's called the quesarito (kay-sorrito,) in other words a burrito wrapped in a quesadilla,Otherwise very delicious option for the off the menu action at chipotle,I would not suggest this for this item I think that by the time it got home with me something of the interplay of hot cheese and meat with the cool,I picked steak for the filling and of course I went for the guacamole, guacamole ,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the salad looked more like a burrito bowl :, I ordered my salad online ,They forgot to put in the most important ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Probably the worst food experience I've ever had,Kind of long for 3 burritos ,A few guys from work decided we wanted chipotle for lunch so we decided to call ahead so we could just swing by ,Never going back to that location and maybe even chipotle all together because of such,and a bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was luke,I hate cold food,Chicken had a burnt taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only did they wash hands and change gloves but they got new food from the back ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the burritos are quickly made ,and served with fluffy white rice with -- I think -- peas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had my usual chicken burritos,I will continue to get their chips and salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Probably for the best since food area looks pretty,Too bad ATL airport food options are so yuk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a really good chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's your typically overpriced Chipotle fare,slopping whatever into a plastic bowl or mealy tortilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's definitely not the healthiest food you could eat (the tortilla alone has 300 calories),more so because Austin has a limited amount of quality burrito places,-if you're not ready for them to douse your entire burrito in hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my burrito bowl was definitely 80% better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How does a place with fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
out of food,chipotle is usually so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Found three hairs in my burrito - gag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Though when we did the mobile order our food wasn't the freshest, Leading me to conclude that the food had been sitting for some time even though we gave our eta, The guacamole was already brown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One gripe: sometimes the food is kind of cold (like the atmosphere),I almost launched my half-digested burrito out the car window,The meat is dang tasty and the rice has a clean,When I saw the billboards about the happy chickens ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like the food pretty much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of beans,and some decent salsa,of meat,if paying upwards of $7 for a salad (w/guacamole) there are better options,but lately they have been very small portions and since it is 60% nutrition less lettuce, It seems that there has been a direct correlation between popularity and portion size (with salads anyway) at this location, The salad option here was a hearty one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came in for tacos ,and the shells were stale and the steak looked like it had been siting for a week,The lettuce was wilted ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Definitely come for the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I usually get a salad with chicken on it ,and it's delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
healthy and decent food,I'm a simpleton on the taco creation factory line: corn tortilla,I'm not going to worry about the wrap because the taco makes my lips,steak,hot sauce and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Felt like I could get some decent food,I don't like having to eat my food out in the open,Felt icky/dirty having to eat my food in the middle of a terminal,and even with airport prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The guacamole is where it's at,you ask for the guacamole add-on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love there food,Good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a burrito ball,if I wanted crappy burritos,and you get maybe half a scoop of beans/rice/meat for your trouble,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For the price they charge for a burrito you'd expect it to be at least 8-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many people try your food for the first,"a fella behind the counter is loudly proclaiming that ""we are out of all rice",but then as I was standing there trying to decide if I could go without rice (I can't,"Just can't do it) a pilot on layover walks up and says ""you're still out of rice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have a broken wrist (forgive the typos) & was happy they gave me a bowl to catch any burrito spills protecting my shirt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is,We always joke about getting one bowl ,We get our own bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amazing burrito bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nasty food,Summer st location has a friendly staff and delicious burritos,I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I stopped coming here since a buddy and I got food poisoning here from two Barbacoa burritos back in the summer ,they all know how to stuff a burrito so you'll get that afternoon slump,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you like Chipotle there's a good chance you'll get the decent food you're used to,and were once out of guacamole three times in a row,the veggies were completely burnt and the guacamole was already going brown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It saddens me to have to give one of my favorite burrito chains two stars,the guy who has made my burrito has given me so much,none of them can wrap a burrito without it ripping,Overall thumbs down on this chipotle,Sorry that I want hot AND corn salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the girl who wrapped my burrito it just fell apart completely,The beans tasted terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible management of their food supplies ,At 6pm on a Sunday night they told all their customers they were out of rice ,your still need to pay full price for a rice-less,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 By the time we left all of the food was fresh, It was one of the best burrito bowls I have had, When we got there they had just finished making new rice ,and the steak was out, The girls at the front were really nice and gave us free drinks while they made us fresh steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a good chipotle location - only problem is I don't come out here a lot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is by far the worse chipotle I've ever been to especially during dinner,I've been to the chipotle in clintonville ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chicken,chicken there is little-to-no,consider yourself warned of the SPICY chicken at Washington St,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If it's not rule don't put it in my food please,Watch what goes in your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got an exploded burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito tasted OK,Maybe the guy rolled my burrito made some fundamental,or maybe a lack of rice makes the burrito leakier,meat and bean juice were running out the bottom of the burrito like a faucet,and this one had run entirely out of rice (brown,Upshot: Get a bowl until these guys learn how to roll a fattie,Could they compensate by spotting me some free guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always order a burrito bowl ,I sometimes feel like the chipotle's are hit or miss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The people at this Chipotle are always nice and make a great burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Good stuff all around - like the high quality food ,- lady makes a burrito into a large,round ball (not into the shape of a burrito), stay away from the burrito ball,takeaways: get a bowl or a salad, they talk about the corn salsa ,i order and get to the salsas,and the ingredients they use,and dumps all the old ingredients onto the new, She has to give it the old ripped tortilla a few shakes to get all the ingredients onto the new, ingredients still are good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is freaking amazing,The prices are a little up there for a burrito (around 7 dollars) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle has pretty decent food otherwise though,Wanted quesaritto but they said I have to pay for a quesadilla and burrito (11ish dollars 0_0 )so that was a no go,Then asked for veggie burrito because I love guacamole, Person making the burrito offered me tofu,"""  It was a no because I added a protein to my veggie burrito",Pretty average chipotle in a decent,"then I thought ""wait let me make sure guacamole is still free",Next time I'll just bring my own guacamole for them to add,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and burritos are the same,but I think you get a more filling meal with the burrito because of the rice ,Recipe for my favorite burrito:, The crispy tacos,soft tacos, price,"tortilla
rice",they do have some interesting meat selections: naturally raised chicken (fajita,and beans,pinto beans (I recommend asking them to drain off some of the juice),medium salsa,"sour cream
cheese",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One plus was good portion sizes for a bowl,The employees are crap & they were out of 2 different salsas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Quality food I have grown to love,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5 people working the front line and still the slowest chipotlet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It needs to be known that your food is not worth,I had a salad with chicken,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thy always rip my burrito ,Like when I get chipotle I think about happiness,today my chips were like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can expect to get the same food,this chipotle goes over ,so we decided to go to chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Since everyone knows what Chipotle is and most locations are the same in quality of food ,I left my wallet at work and I told them I would walk back to the office to grab my money and then come back for my burrito,They said absolutely not and comped my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The guacamole had a lovely brown,lots of white & yellow iceberg lettuce,I barely ate my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spiders crawling in food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not worth the burrito bowl,This is one of the worst chipotle locations I've ever visited,They're also especially stingy with ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How hard is to keep the simple ingredients available,I know this is a new location but why did you open if you weren't able to keep up with prep and having ingredients available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pick out some not fully cook chicken pieces,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff was very friendly just had a poor wrap job on my burrito,Food was fresh and tasted great and was priced decently (under $10),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For the most part the food is consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes the burrito bowls are so spot, on and other times the rice is like it was never cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For a chipotle downtown austin they tend to run out of everything,today they didn't have meat or chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and even when the place is packed you get your food very fast,A great place to get a cal-style bigass burrito,luckily I don't like guacamole on burritos,And after eating a whole chipotle burrito,The core burrito ingredients are slightly better at Chipotle,Other pluses: rice is very tasty,Minuses: their price for adding guacamole is like $1,The chicken is very good,black beans have good,hottest salsa is very hot,1000+ calories of pure meaty joy,It's also common to have the staff ask you two or three times what type of meat you want,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We pay for our food ,We all eat our food ,this food has no flavor,$53 for flavorless food than none of us liked,cause this Chipotle tasted like fake food,I eat chipotle once a month ,I'll try the other 2 local chipotles,They were out of white rice ,So the white rice wasn't ready,the flunky cook decided to start making the rice ,The white rice tasted terrible,I could've gone to Mcdonalds and gotten a better tasting meal for 1/2 the price,I'll drive a bit further but that's the price I'll have to pay I guess,the veggies weren't cooked enough and the meat was near flavorless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
crunchy taco shells or even freaking lettuce,Every time I come in here they are out of something like guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Giant bowl w chicken 6,chicken is always so flavorful,Cheap and absolutely delicious, and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The customer service was great and the food just as awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I LOVE Chipotle burrito bowls , The carnitas weren't as shredded as they should have been and instead were big chunks of too seasoned meat,I recently ordered a salad with carnitas , The whole salad didn't taste as great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They made my burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They never skimp you on your food ,I ordered a chicken bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really good food--Service is pretty,darn competent compared to most chipotle's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 No more line up to get my favourite burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can honestly say Chipotle has better food than Lolita's,I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Yes I know their food is far more authentic,version of Mexican food , If there is any sort of line I feel a lot of pressure from the employees serving as to what food to pick ,Acceptable food ,their burritos are too big, Usually I just end up getting a bowl, The bowls are tasty,The best thing about going to Chipotle is the guacamole, Their cheese is also sort of bl,cheddar isn't authentic and their white cheese is , Their sour cream is too runny," I completely realize Taco Bell is ""Americanized"" fast foods but to me it just usually tastes better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and poor prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prefer the bowls over the burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the difference in ""food ",but in a pinch for a big burrito with lots of fixin's,I actually think many of the materials available for your burrito pleasure are superior,I think that Chipotle may as well be a fast food burrito stand,"""I'm in the mood for a burrito ",some of the sauces/salsas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get my food to go at this location,Big burritos,and they water down a burrito that's likely,They put too much rice on the burritos -- I always ask for half a scoop,biggish tacos,or a slightly lower carb version in a bowl with your very basic,I like the chunky toppings (pico de gallo and corn salsa),but the smoother salsas aren't exciting,which comes with guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all the crud on the counter fell right back into the food bins,My burrito,had WAY too much guacamole so that all I could taste was avocado,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  I've been to many a Chipotle but until this one opened I had never felt hungry after eating a Chipotle burrito,  Food quality seems on par with other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your rice is a product of divine,delicious Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like spicy foods ,and delicious food,white rice,When I visit I order the same thing - chicken bowl, I have tried their Sofritas instead of chicken (twice) ,ands both the chicken ,pinto beans,chips ,cheese ,A few times I've tried to give the benefit of the doubt to the 161 location and they're always out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I skip on rice,but load up on extra veggies and chicken,delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's so easy to rip on chipotle,organic and value is a rare trifecta that chipotle has mastered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the food is always pretty fresh,Only problem is that they sometimes go too fast and a bowl can come out a little,so of course it's also delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I like Mexican food ,and usually visit Chipotle  (I know it's technically not authentic Mexican food),The service was poor and the food wasn't like other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these guys act like the food comes out of their paychecks,Any other chipotle gives me very generous,I've gotten about half a scoop of rice both times coming here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They messed up on my sons kid meal chicken quesadilla so they were nice to add in a taco free,Always good experience when visiting this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chips tasted like stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On two separate occasions I bought meals for myself or my family and there seems to be zero seasoning in the food,I don't like overly spicy food,nor do I like food that is smothered in sauces or cheese,as I feel like those things can mask the actual taste of the food,the food was bland,and there seems to be zero quality control,It's very bland and basically tasteless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They're excellent at getting people their food in a timely,My burrito bowls are also always consistent - same amount of each food item each time ,You don't have to worry about getting that one person who is stingy with the meat or something because nobody is stingy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff was extremely accommodating to wanting a burrito bowl ,salsa on the side ,I walked out with a very filling and delicious meal withing about 6 minutes ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and then you have to BEG for them to actually put a normal amount of toppings on your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get the steak burrito bowl ,Making my own burrito bowls from now on,McDonalds owns chipotle,and my stomach ALWAYS hurts after b/c the steak is undercooked,Would you buy steak from McDonalds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chicken seemed like it was left over from the night before,"They ""ran out"" of beans ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
worst burrito I've had in a minute ,and then found a hair in the bag of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a chicken salad & they gave me a good, portion of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go often because I enjoy the food,It seems like when I go in the afternoon they give you less meat than during the dinner rush,they run out of items often (like 7:30pm on a Friday night and they run out of cheese wtf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Mild sauce added a hint of spice but not overpowering the food,  I liked the chicken ,and steak meat combination,Simple ingredients created some great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Have eaten at chipotle regularly since they opened ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle food is awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is always fresh, These are master burrito crafters here folks,as you can taste that their ingredients are fresh, (and they're good about re-filling their ingredients in the assembly line), You can get delicious satisfaction for just $6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"listen to the person in front of you ordering so that when the gal says ""mumble or mumble beans",""" you'll know to say ""black beans"" or ""refried","beans""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
natural ingredients,Portions of those ingredients are not particularly generous,but may be ample enough to satisfy most appetites if enough ingredients are chosen from the assembly line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent fresh food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fast service and food quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As a picky eater I love the variety of foods that I get to choose from,If you're looking for authentic mexican food,It's more along the lines of a wrap rather than a burrito,Next time I think I want to try a bowl instead of a burrito,Black and Pinto beans,like I don't eat salso but I could get corn salsa instead,I don't even get salsa in mine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got my food to go,And chipotle is everything if you haven't already been,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Decided I was in a burrito mood on Marathon Monday ,Almost halfway into my burrito,and that it wasn't just the sour cream that was making the burrito lukewarm (points for cold,The staff was really accommodating and refunded my burrito ,They ran out of chicken by the time I was there,but I didn't mind waiting for a fresh batch of grilled chicken (score,I realized much to my chagrin I was eating nearly raw chicken,DR: Check the chicken before you chow down,fresh meat, sour cream though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  I ordered a bowl,This Chipolte is just around the corner from State ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tables are always dirty (found a day old burrito under a table once),- Worst chipotle I've been in,- You have to literally repeat yourself twice on every ingredient you want,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 And now for my biggest problem with this location that ensures I will never come back - when you are at the counter ordering your food if someone comes in the front, I get the same exact burrito every time yet it tastes different, Sometimes I think they have forgotten to put spices in the rice or something, The quality has gone significantly downhill recently,I may visit another location in the future but this locations service and quality may have just made me say goodbye to Chipotle forever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have seen maybe 3 or 4 patrons and no food on the line,If I go back to chipotle,I have had to wait for steak both times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the always stuff the burritos,and the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for a burrito bowl with fajitas ,I just want my burrito in peace ,I emailed chipotle regarding their bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 This was absolutely the worst Chipotle food we have ever had,was that I watched them make my chicken burrito , Do you know how when you are eating or have eaten a Chipotle chicken burrito, After eating my burrito, There was maybe 1 oz of chicken,was the quality of the chicken,blandest chicken I have ever tasted,smokey grilled chicken smell that normally hits you , When I first asked for cheese she put on barely enough, As soon as they put the lettuce in the put the lid on , There was maybe enough lettuce to cover a white,It started with my wife asking for a lid for her salad because she wouldn't be able, This location was actually the first one that we ever tried but it seems to have fallen down in quality in 2016 so we started going to New Albany ,quality peaks ,and plummets based on the quality of the workers ,quality varies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make-your-own burrito as you go,For the price ,with a variety of options: brown/black rice,steak/chicken/pork/grilled,black or pinto beans,they have good meat,One downside is paying extra for guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the servie was relatively fast and the prices are fair but im not too sure about the kind of food that is served,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
regular of chipotle,But this particular location always gives out uncooked white rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not much to say about them other than they have amazing food,If you have to go during the rush you can always order your food online or with the Chipotle app ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We ordered two chicken burrito bowls, The veggies where thrown on top of his bowl ,  We both don't eat beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty positive I got food poisoning from this place,never had a problem with chipotle before, probably never eating chipotle again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but today I ordered a chicken burrito , The chicken was burnt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the food despite it being over priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not a whole lot to say about this place as it's your typical chain restaurant but the restaurant and kitchen looked clean and my food was made correctly ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Although most of the food was good,Our chips were stale,We really wanted the chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With all the problems surrounding the food quality,Too bad considering the food was good,- There was no black beans,no sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was so much rice in it that i couldnt even tell if there was meat in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I have begun to frequent other Burrito locations in the area because I am unsure what is tasting ""off"" about my food here",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good food, Good variety of meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All of the food was perfect,Did I mention they sent me coupons for free food,And now that I work across the street I sort of hate them because I will want every day to be taco Tuesday,I get the same thing every time - a bowl with just about everything on it,carnitas plus chips ,and guac but some places overly salt the chips or over spice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went to have some food at this Chipotle with my Colleagues,so I will give 2 star one for food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just put some effort into folding the burrito,"It's great until you open the foil and the whole thing falls apart and it's no longer the ""burrito"" you payed for",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ended up waiting around 20 minutes before we got to the front and the girl prepping my food would not listen,I asked her for a side of pico and she spoons the largest serving I've ever seen directly on top of my food,When we stopped here last week for dinner there was a massive queue of people waiting on chicken,when it was more like 15 by the time the chicken was chopped up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was delish,but today I opted for steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overall the food is average,They over charge you for sides which were thrown on top of your food so you're kind of committed,That is highly over priced,all I could taste on the chicken was the burned,Now about the guacamole,95 for a dollop of bland guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As I was sitting eating my food there was an employee eating right,she reached into the chips multiple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually avoid Chipotle though I really like the food,cranky and needing food FAST,barbacoa burrito ,Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is it IS fast food and they forgot the chips/rice/beans for the kids meal,2 other options fell through and I was in the mood for guacamole,I got the veggie salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its hard eating beans with a fork,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm embarassed to admit that I like food made at a restaurant owned by McDonald's, Tasty fast-food Mexican fare served up just the way you like it - as a burrito,"or as a ""bowl"" (a burrito w/o the tortilla)",in tacos,they throw it together with some fluffy rice,your beans,your salsa ,choose your meat,give them a yea or nay on cheese ,and sour cream,a salad, You can get a delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
com/articles/2013-10-03/chipotle-the-one-that-got-away-from-mcdonald,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cold rice,cold chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I LOVE chipotle by went by here today ,and had a free chips ,and guacamole coupon,ended up paying for the guacamole after asking them twice if they took it off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know closing time but no mild or corn salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A lot of times when I go to Chipotle at a weird midday hour the food does not always seem very fresh,and was very impressed that the food seemed so fresh,If you like hot food like myself make sure,Was very pleased with this Chipotle and my food,This chipotle in particular,My go to order is always a salad bowl with steak," to get the ""hot"" salsa","I usually get the ""hot"" and ""mild"" on top of my salad",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best chipotle in central,Big chipotle fan ,The rice is never salty ,and the chicken is never r,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not sure why there were 4 people behind the counter and only one person making food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The employees here really skimp on the food,on the other day they also has a FYI board we d not use naturally raised steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just have to shout out this AMAZING customer service- I have worked in retail and food service in the past,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
coli cases in Ohio was hilariously minuscule compared to the raw volume of burritos that they unload (heh,get as much stuff on your burrito as you can,that's like two burritos,I wish Chipotle wasn't so delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got tired of waiting on brown rice for my burrito,Got shorted guacamole on my order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I give them three stars because sometimes you go there and have your food in under a minute,A few weeks I went there and they were out of the cardboard bottoms for the burrito bowls,but far too many need to go to back to burrito school, First they ran out of white rice, So my bowl with brown rice sag there getting cold while I waited for them to screw around making the white,rice, I would have gotten the white rice in a timely,manner if the kid in front of me hadn't had them load his bowl up with triple white rice, I would have gotten the white  in a timely manner if the kid in front of me hadn't had them load his bowl up with triple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But I'll take good food over comfortable,The burrito bowl was nigh,and price at this Chipotle is on par with the one I frequent in Raleigh,The quality,and the taste was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A half a scoop of rice ,and a slop of sour cream later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I wish they could have normal chipotle hours (maybe 11am to 10pm ,I'll always love chipotle,I get steak ,they don't even have steak prepared,so I have to wait like 15 minutes while my steak is being cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the steak bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was somewhat surprised to see that prices were the same,Same quality,same great taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the guac is good but the chips are too salty,everything tastes the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just comfort Mexican food,Chain chipotle,they do the same thing at every chipotle so you know what you're going to get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food that was in the display was cold ,But this chipotle in particular has extremely novice employees that don't even know how to wrap a burrito properly,This has to be one of the lower end chipotle restaurants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
including the food counter,-Ran out of soft tacos,-At 12pm they ran out of brown rice,I couldn't eat the bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food wasn't seasoned properly the last,The white rice didn't have the citrus ,and salt and the beans were under seasoned,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They throw the ingredients into/unto/around your burrito,The burrito comes out soggy,they don't drain the wet salsa,and they get ingredients everywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seriously chipotle, Then when I get home my salsa is less than half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is my favorite chipotle in the Westerville area,The main reason is the staff here are much friendlier than the other chipotles nearby,A few months ago they started giving far less rice and other toppings than before and compared to the other chipotles,clean chipotle that I always enjoy going to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Your hand should not be able to wrap itself around your burrito"" -- Five Summer Street Chipotle ""Experts""",The Summer Street location has much more girth to their burritos ,and bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came in at 3pm and the food was fresh,most locations have had the food laying around for awhile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Chipotle of Clermont's staff is exceptionally friendly and the food is served just like it should be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle i have ever been too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We both ordered chicken burrito bowls,My wife paid extra for the guacamole   The portions were small,the guacamole had hard, chunks and the corn was hard also,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 No guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PROS: The food tastes good,ability to customize food,CONS: The food is a bit expensive,and generally has too much juice/sauce which either drowns your bowl or makes for a very messy burrito,($7 for a bowl of rice,beans , Sometimes the beans are cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Around 10pm that evening the stomach pains started and by 12am was full blown food poisoning,sorry you had to use paid time off because you chose to purchase our food,I stuck it out when customers were getting sick across the country because it wasn't in my state and frankly I loved the food,I would think after an episode like that they would have customer service for foodborne illness down to a science,On Sunday March 26th 2017 I ordered and finished a barbacoa bowl with grilled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quesadilla was a soft taco tortilla with sparse, amount of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3) when you enter a food establishment the last,At this point I feel more comfortable preparing my burritos at home ,I'm a chipotle fan,I will pass on chipotle with the family if I know we are going to this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've ordered burritos,salads and bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Decided to order a veggie burrito instead of meat after I saw how messy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
out of guacamole at 1pm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle location I've been to,filthy tables and they ran out of chicken while I was in line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The helping was ridiculously massive and as always  the chips were epic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And when I took a bite of my burrito bowl it seemed very soupy,I mean just like any chipotle it is clean, The ingredients seem a little bland compared to all the other chipotles I've been to,The rice is undercooked as well ,Possibly when I asked for the green salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't waste your time ordering online to-go unless you like cold food that's been sitting for 15 minutes in a fast,food type heater fridge,Customers in the original line got their food before me ,PS don't waste your money ordering double meat here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible food, They seem to run out of food or there equipment breaks down,For example the rice machine broke down without rice might as well  shut down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went there with my 2 sons and a baby roach fell from the ceiling on to our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had high chairs and regular food court chairs,After I got my food,a burrito could be 1035 calories,I ordered their burrito bowl,I added brown rice,black beans,regular tomato salsa ,and their tomatillo green chilli salsa,cheese,sour cream,Also a salad could be 850 calories,even better that all the ingredients were fresh,Safe to say that this combo was so delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Someone please notify Yelp that this place is claiming to be ""Mexican"" food",There should be a law about miscategorizing food this way ,The guy who started this chain took cooking classes in New York and all the sudden thinks he knows how to make Mexican food,The other three are missing because you are Chipotle and your food is always extremely bl,I get and appreciate that the idea here is to serve Organic food,and being unsure of who has your food ,This corporate chain (owned by McDonald's no less) should be boycotted so a real Mexican food joint can open up,The food here is not that great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the food here ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I gave them 3 stars cuz the manager was actually very nice about it and fixed it but I had to drive back there so next time I'm def checking my food before leaving,The last time I came here I got a burrito ,and it was all rice so I get a salad instead ,Why is there no lettuce in my salad,When I order salad I expect toppings on top of lettuce not just toppings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and seem to not care about getting food out,fresh food,I have been going to this chipotle since it opened,I love chipotle,stale chips,I have tried to order chips on many,The chips are so stale,non-stale chips,This ranges from cold meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is probably why the quality of the food is going down,I get my usual burrito bowl (sparing the details,It's clear the chipotle hype is over already,The rice is never cooked all the way through,it's chewy in the middle which is not something you want in rice especially a rice bowl,The chips are so so so salty ,Salsa and sour cream are fine,and I can't really taste the sofritas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came during closing time and I was starving for some chipotle and they were nice enough to stay open an extra 15 minutes while me and my children ordered our food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really good American Mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I crave a burrito as I lay here writing this review, Fat boy can envision the nearly 1 pound burritos dancing around begging to be bitten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
white rice pinto beans, The meal tasted very good and was definitely worth more than the price, The girl making my order I selected a bowl with shredded,salsa,and corn salsa,and corn , shredded beef had a thick texture and had a strong beef taste which was very good and blended in well with the other ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
) behind her refilling the food,I wasn't aiming for a large meal so I ordered a kids size chicken ,She then proceeds to put the oversized chicken in the tortilla,I head to the cash register and tell him what I ordered (kids chicken ,and cheese quesadilla,The next woman fills it with cheese,However its overflowing with cheese ,and cheese quesadilla) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome chipotle location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are more or less California/Mission style,Freebirds is a step up for this kind of burrito (many,but I'd rather save a couple bucks and get a burrito at a local,One of my biggest complaints is that they charge you for extra salsa,the ingredients seem fresh,more choices of ingredients),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes the rice is hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only when I got to the end and the girl informed me they'd be charging me for a burrito instead of a quesadilla because of the beans did I underst,Had I known I'd be charged for a burrito,I love chipotle,Got a chicken quesadilla ,and had to fight the girl to put beans on it,but god forbid you put a spoonful of beans on a Mexican,Minimal cheese,like they're running out or something (see my other reviews to discover how I feel about people being chintzy with the cheese),$3 extra for guac and sour cream,Wanted to get corn ,Food quality same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and food,and even giving out a free burrito card for our next,#burritosforlif,Came to Chipotle for dinner and they ran out of rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their chicken is especially salty,I just wish the staff and chicken were more on par with other,they are skimpy on their ingredients even ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the food is usually good,However certain food preparers are skimpy on serving sizes,It's chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle in general has decent burritos,and then (at least at this location) give you a heap of guac that kinda overpowers the rest of the burrito,I would love half the guac for the half the price,beans,meat,veggies and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been to this chipotle since it opened more times than I can count waiting for it to get better, I have one suggestion for anyone who loves chipotle as I do avoid this chipotle or you will get sick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Defn not going to this chipotle ever again,I just ordered a couple of bowls for my roommates,They didn't make the bowls correctly ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because it is so busy I feel like the food is fresher than at a deserted,If you're into eating two pounds of food at a time ,But often I get called upon to pick up various burritos ,and bowls for my employers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The veggies tacos are the best,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a great burrito place,My burrito wasn't wrapped too well ,Otherwise she gave generous portions of meat,Solid quality ,and taste at every location I've visited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is generally on par with most chipotle,food,I don't want free food,and this is the nearest chipotle,I'm not reviewing this chipotle to tell you not to go there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they've gotten some new staff that can't seem to wrap a single burrito without it ripping open,but I'm a burrito kind of girl,and I could get a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think it also depends on who preps your order because sometimes I feel I get more food than other,and get the edible burrito bowl ,and free guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And they have hired some new girl with red colored hair that BARELY gives you enough rice,beans or meat to fill half your bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The taste was just like any other mexican food joint,large portions for those looking to share a burrito with your 3 person family (4 if we are talking very small,grilled veggies and lean meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is not as fresh,the assistant manager came to young men who was charging his phone but not ordered any food ,I am not sure if it is always store policy to kick people out who don't buy food or it was some sort of profiling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An employee at this store named Valerie prepared our food today with no hair,which is a violation of the Ohio Uniform Food Safety Code for food services,that are designed and worn to effectively keep their hair from contacting exposed food,This provision does not apply to food employees such,as counter staff who only serve beverages and wrapped or packaged foods,and wait staff if they present a minimal risk of contaminating exposed food, If an employee is handling food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The clincher was getting almost to the counter and having to wait while the 1 guy making food finished his conversation about tattoos with the customer in front of me,2 people cooking chicken on the grill (looks like a 1 person job to me),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the chicken salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I almost chipped a tooth because the rice was so hard,Oh and let's not forget about the dry and tasteless chicken,The beans well i usually get pinto,beans ,but they looked so dry and disgusting i opted for black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am a 10+ year customer of chipotle,You have to fight to get even a normal portion of rice or beans or salsa - let alone,To top it off when I got home and looked in my bag the side container of guacamole I paid extra for was barely half,Tonight I asked for a little more cheese added to the meager amount he put on ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love burritos especially at places like Chipotle that give you a huge,burrito ,and stuffs it with plenty of meat,like the steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50 tacos at El Chilito right, And I love their cilantro rice -- I went to A&M,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I give it a 5 star rating because of its high quality and decent price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and you will have the meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always has some ingredient missing ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the medium corn salsa,I actually got a good helping of steak,and lots of cheese,lackadaisical grab of cheese,sour cream,I make my way through my usual ingredients,Everybody knows Chipotle's delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was fresh,the prices are great,They were excited to find out I was new to Chipotle and gave me free guacamole, and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle used to be pretty good,gave me barely any chicken at all because they were too lazy,they nearly always burn their chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food lacks freshness ,This Location consistently disappoints and is the worst run chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoyed the sofrita (tofu) burrito because it is a type of burrito that is not commonly available, This restaurant could become a three or  four-star easily with some additional training and practice of the new staff on how to fold the burritos without tearing the wrap, The host making my burrito could benefit from some additional,training as after three tries of my burrito being attempted the wrap broke, After each attempt the ingredients were transferred with some loss to another burrito wrap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a pork burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chips and hot salsa only,FYI-the copious amounts of salt on the chips are hotter than the hot salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But my three tacos were all rolled up together in one piece of foil ,Chips and salsa didn't fail me tho,Forgot the lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice,just so I can get a chicken Bowl,chicken,and cheese, Having the foil top on for a few minutes will help melt the cheese,with lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1) no brown rice at all,2) no black beans,3) WHY USE GLOVES IF YOU ARE GOING TO WIPE THE TABLE OFF WITH THEM and then use those same hands to fill my cheese ,and lettuce up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So on my way home tonight my kids wanted chipotle so I stopped by this restaurant I ordered 3 Chicken bowls and chips and drinks with each meal first off when I was getting my burrito the counters was covered in food ,but I was hungry and had to get home to the kids when I finally made it home and my daughter brought me here food saying it tasted funny,I looked and some of the chicken was uncooked so I go down ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 CMG has high prices and stuffs their burritos with a bunch of rice,Overpriced crap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their chips taste different,it was delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A lot of people on here have complained about the rice being undercooked,but my experience was different the rice was overcooked,I should've spoke up when I noticed the server use her fingers to scoop the rice off of the serving spoon, It takes nothing to redo a pot of rice,PS The guacamole is disgusting ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have not been a fan of chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is always fresh,good food,This is actually the only chipotle I like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now burritos do,Every time I get a burrito here,I'm a sucker for a good burrito,but it is a really excellent addition to your burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All these years I've never been a fan of chipotle,I got the bowl ,The portions are right and it's just delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle should be shut down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They couldn't complete another order no black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and yummy food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It looked like someone puked guacamole in my barbacoa,"The "" salad "" they remade me had absolutely no lettuce",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first time i went for dinner on my birthday and they gave me a complementary burrito bowl which made my night,I've been to this chipotle twice so far ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the staff is on the ""unfriendly"" side and there is very little care or consideration shown when preparing the food",and I waited for a minute or two to get my cheese ,and lettuce because the person who does that was chatting with someone so the person who just helped me couldn't be bother,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food never disappoints,and hey you are getting quite alot of food,The burritos are expensive,once you see the size and freshness of the human sized burrito you are about to purchase,Warning: Think up alternate ways to eat the burrito,except the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great airport food experience,A saw fresh chicken being put out ,All ingredients were fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 He offered me a taste and it was pretty good and didn't burn my mouth (I'm not a fan of hot food),I was going to grab my usual veggie bowl to go, I got the Sofrita bowl, I am back at work eating my bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the things that amazed me at this Chipotle was the process in which they went through to serve me my food ,cheese ,and lettuce) from a container that hasn't been used on the line or use paper to grab the serving spoons,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I gave them a four star because the food was great, Finally the four start is for their reasonable prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love that they use REAL food,A great fresh fast-food option,We ordered their (generously portioned) burritos & i had a bowl as i am a gluten,Their rice is delightful,but the guacamole & salsa options was great, & we all LOVED their chips made in-house,The meats were tasty,The cheese was blah,I peeked their menu online ahead of our visit & was really impressed with their ethically sourced ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For instance a couple days ago they forgot to put steak on my steak burrito bowl,I complained to chipotle about half the time ,""" yeah chipotle I do have problems ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How are you supposed to eat a bowl without any lettuce it's 6:00 in the evening how is this acceptable,This is our SECOND time going to this location and each time they have been out of lettuce,Not waiting on lettuce,no doubt they have lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a salad bowel to go ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food never tastes fresh, and I've thrown away my burrito bowl multiple,Also in the same bowl I bit something even harder (must have been a bone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for rice ,I asked for hot salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chicken burrito with brown,My son turned me on to chipotles, rice,black beans,half chunky mild and hot salsa,cheese ,and lettuce to finish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today was my first time using the app to order my food,My food was made exactly to order ,and was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1) burrito artistry,If you're not able to stuff my burrito as full,I've eaten at a lot of chipotles ,2) amount of salt on the chips,and if your chips don't have enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My friend and I had to take our food to go because we couldn't st,Be ready to let the employees know what you want because they are quick in getting your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Probably the worst burrito I have ever had,My spouse had a steak bowl ,Steak was tough and gristly and the rest of the filler was tasteless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
poor food quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was bland,We decided to come to chipotle because we had a buy one get one free,The quality of chipotle has decreased,With so many people at this chipotle we were wondering why it was so popular,"With so many new ""chipotle""/customizable",we know there are better alternatives and will not be returning to chipotle,We noticed the prices were lower than last,The brown rice was smooshy, - probably because of the mounds of meat and rice people were getting,beans were tasteless,the guacamole didn't have any flavor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every bowl I had made (I ordered 3) was correct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice was undercooked,ruined my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are 5 chipotle employees sitting around a table rather than working to get customers through the line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is generally good,I ordered my food online,The food was cold,The rice was stale, and the chicken was dry,I immediately noticed that the portions were very small and the corn salsa I usually order was swapped with the chilli,but I had correctly ordered the corn salsa,I am almost never disappointed by the quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was just as I expect Chipotle to be,We paid extra for a bag of chips,I don't mind paying for chips here,but we were given a bag that was less than one quarter filled with stale chips,fresh and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always pre order online and tell them the time that i will pick up my food, Trying not to go there as much now because it just doesn't feel good to pay $20 for 2 burritos a d walk away feeling like I was not treated the way a customer would be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I had to try to carry all of my food home in the most inconvenient,That being said there are a few kind employees here and the food is usually pretty good,This used to be one of my favorite chipotles ,I love chipotle,But their chips tasted stale this time too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but not satisfied with the quality of food from this location,During the middle of lunch rush hour when food is usually the most fresh,tasteless and cold and rice had a very powerful,If the rice didn't taste bad,the chicken was overcooked /, taste like cleaning products,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the delicious food as always,We chatted while he put together our burritos ,and my bowl,Went to pay and he comped my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,this restaurant is always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They cut you off before you can even answer their questions about what you want on your food, They pretend not to hear you if you request something such as mild AND hot salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good food at a good, price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always have to ask to ad more 17 beans is not enough for a bowl lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the quality of food is good,have witnessed the horrifying burrito ball that is made here,I also saw more than one burrito ball erupt ,Luckily I saw the burrito ball mess before I ordered so I get tacos,I was disappointed to find out that they do not offer corn soft tacos,the second person what type of rice ,and beans,the third what type of salsa,It's sort of funny going down the chain as you tell the first person what kind of tortilla and meat you want,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We order 2 Barbacoa burritos,and rice,beans, The salsa, Both are made of stone-cold meat,cheese,and sour cream just make it worse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no chips ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been to the restaurant many times and I've always been happy with the food,The food is always fresh,The burrito bowl has enough for 2 meals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As always the food is great,the only thing I would say is that with this location they give half the amount of chips than any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this place really has the most fresh tasting and well seasoned food, And for all the fast food burrito places, I'm a fan of both the carnitas and chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,food was good,had two burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its not about the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited at the register with my burrito bowl completely made for an employee to ring me out,There was one girl making burritos,I love chipotle at other,they were totally out of brown rice ,but halfway through eating my bowl I found a piece of a vegetable,After searching my bowl,and they were also out of corn salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And if it doesn't look like I'm getting a good portion of any of the food,I usually got within the last hour they're open and get a good portion of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 the chicken wasn't very hot, Unfortunately this locations quality isn't the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My favorite chipotle location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The steak and chicken options are simmered in a spicy marinade which would be quite good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I applaud Chipotle for their food st,The tacos should cost less than the bowls & burritos- I'm getting way less,andards & becoming GMO free and understand that responsibility of that level comes at a higher price in the product however,For the price I'm paying I deserve the whole,whole handful and full bag of chips- what I'm getting is shards,The larger quesadilla has cheese only in the middle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my burrito had to be re-wrapped,My salad did not include the salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the stingiest food spot I've ever been to ,This chipotle is the stingiest chipotle I've ever been to,I had to ask for more rice 3 times just to get it up to the standard chipotle scoop, Terrible service highly recommend choosing another chipotle before even looking through their dirty,Justine started off my bowl to go with a half scoop of white rice,The pinto beans were bone,This n**** Eatin beans,The chips had zero salt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The line moves just as quickly as at any full scale Chipotle and the food is just as tasty,delicious burritos,A layover can't get much better than sneaking a Chipotle burrito into a SkyClub to have a couple beers with, Hopefully some day I'll be there early enough to try the interesting breakfast burritos you can only get at the airport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered two cheese and chicken quesadillas ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Food was cold and they are cheap with the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
run out to my car and then come back to pick up my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chips are chewy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even better prices,The server gave me enough rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is well prepared, In all ways they fall below expectations of the food that I've come to expect from Chipotle, If you're used to having a huge bursting-at-the-seams burrito from other, On multiple occasions I've had to beg to get more than a thimble of cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And food was quick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but when I pay almost $9 for chips,I expect there to be more than a small handful of chips in the bag ,if I wanted lime on my chips,guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It felt and tasted like Taco Hell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually ask for hard shell tacos on the side with my bowl ,The lovely young lady suggested soft corn tortillas instead a d I thought why not,She warned them up for me and I must say they were delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Salty salty food even without the burritto,Two had veggie burrito with different,The worst was the rice,white rice was oversalted as were the peppers n, beans and i had chicken,Ordered the chips n salsa with meal,thank god less salt in chips than normal,000mg with meat,the staff here cant mix up ingredients well ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Attitude of the girl making our bowls was ridiculous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ive visited several different Chipotles and the food always seems to be the same,And the burritos are usually wrapped nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you can't see that they food is spoiled why are you working there,Worst chipotle ever,No chips or fruit,The lettuce for the salad was brown so I asked for fresh,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my bowl was waiting for toppings ,and they added chicken  ,The guy 2 people in front of me said all 3 salsas,then the guy in front of me didn't  get his chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Smallest amount of meat ive ever seen a chipotle put in a bowl the last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank goodness had a coupon for a free burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You guys barely gave me rice ,My friend ordered some veggies and wow you guys are either really stingy or you think we're using the fat people hack where you can order veggies AND meat LOL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
counter staff are quick to respond to special requests and overall the food hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully the food hadnt been sitting there for too long,The guy making my food was nice,02 and I had the spicy beef burrito $7,My bf ordered the chicken taco bowl $7,I prefer the chicken meat chunks over the shredded,so will probably get the chicken next, and gave me medium spicy sauce and mild salsa,We added guacamole for $2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I recalled that their burritos are gigantic,which is essentially all the burrito ingredients with romaine lettuce in a bowl,My Carnitas Salad was easier to eat and less messy than a burrito,and Salads are all the same price depending on which meat you choose,so I got a salad instead,and it was fresh tasting and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No meat in some ,got it home and found was all wrong and quality was really bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finally they took our order (so severely unfriendly) and the food buckets were almost all empty so of course our bowls were skimpy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is their lack of variety in the food, The tacos and burrito are all top,the pork or chicken soft tacos are quite delicious, quality using the organic ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let's talk about why I like the food,I love chipotle,I like to order the bowl,Or maybe I just love just about anything with chips and salsa,I love me some corn salsa too,Their chips with the lime salt is so darn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And I have a burrito bowl of meat cheese ,I asked for medium and hot salsa on my bowl (the salsa and guac is the only reason I still go to chipotle),and rice,It was bland and near tasteless without the salsa I requested,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No white rice & no chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""oh my gosh you can TOTALLY pick up food after 5 any time you want",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good place if you're looking for some tasty and filling burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do yourself a favor and avoid giving business to this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
worker had no clue that the rice she was serving was ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gloves are for food h,When I asked him why he was wearing gloves he said he was bagging chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We took the food to go,I had the sofrita burrito bowl,and my friend had the chicken one,We also got a bag of chips ,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chips are tasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ended up grabbing my own cup and taking my food without paying because the cashier was not there-,If the food wasn't so good-,The steak was so chewy and the rice was cold,no chips for the guac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last time eating chipotle from this location, Gave them another shot after not having corn or tomato salsa, This time I decided to order a salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I typically love the food at Chipotle,The food is inconsistent,When I asked one employee to wrap up my tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the Subway of corporate mexican food,it's chipotle, The quality is what you expect if you've ever been to one anywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love chipotle & this location,You can't go wrong with chipotle,"when I was paying today I overheard of the front of the line guys (younger guy) turn to the back and asked ""you got more chicken right"" to what I'm assuming is the manager","The manager then replied with ""that's the last time you'll ask for chicken like that"" ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place food qu,ality gone south on top of that they don't give meat,you pay for meat bu,t u get very little meat,On the 3/10/18 i visited this Chipotle and ordered steak ,but the stake has no taste at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Subpar chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place food qu,Chipotle soon will start talking our money and not give us food,ality gone south on top of that they don't give meat,you pay for meant but u get very little meat,On the 3/10/18 i visited this Chipotle and ordered steak ,but the stake has no taste at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the barbacoa burrito, I liked the spicy dressing and the generous portion of chicken,my salad tasted alright,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That was the worst food I ever had in the last,and ordered tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I eat at Chipotle all the time and love the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 This is the second time I have gone to one of their restaurants and the rice is too al, They need to teach that's stores how to cook rice properly,they burnt the chicken which also dried those pieces out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 First of all the portions are tiny compared to every other Chipotle and the workers have to be the stupidest people i have ever come across- every time I go I ask for a salad ,I can't even remember how many times I went home to discover there was no salad dressing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My chips and taco shells were stale,The pinto beans were hard and there was barely ANY rice at all which sucks because they were vegetarian tacos,so the rice makes up a big,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered our food to go,Which is always the worse because you're really banking on your food to be decent,Started digging into our bowls and we both found numerous hard (unable to chew) objects in our food,It's pretty gross when you're finding multiple unknown things in your food,maybe it was overcooked rice or plastic,2 bowls, Oh yeah they also told me at 7pm on a Friday night they weren't making anymore black beans for the night,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the place was clean and the food was fresh,Great work chipotle employees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
00 bill the two Brainiacs(one working at the register and the one wrapping the food next,I went there a few times before I complained about them having the Trash Barrel next to where they store the extra tacos,Each time they run out of tacos or they need to get the some other,she moved the Trash Barrel from the corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The past two visits my bowl had no meat in it and this visit my food was never made,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
com/food_party/125679/myth_that_mcdonalds_owns_chipotle,Second of all: Get a delicious burrito bowl with lots of veggies ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have ALWAYS loved chipotle,So I would always recommend chipotle to visitors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Was there the other day and the guy preparing my   bowl had dreds ,When I got home I discovered he left me a strand in my sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and as someone who has managed food service ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
resolve it on your own time because it's awkward for customers who are waiting on their food while you are busy,The freshness has always been questionable here but their ability to even assembly a bowl or provide quality service has been gradually degrading to the point where I might just forego my Chipotle cravings from now on,- If I ask for beans / salsa I get a heap of liquid in my bowl ,someone wiped the counter off and used the same gloves to scoop lettuce and cheese into the person behind me's bowl,- Three times I've gotten a batch of stale chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but usually we do the online ordering/pick-up and walk back home with the food,I usually order a steak burrito with white,rice,white rice,My wife gets a chicken bowl with fajitas,My only complaint is that they sometimes burn the chicken,black beans,tomato salsa,tomato and corn salsa,which is why I stick to the steak,sour cream and cheese,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My bowl was more than enough food,I ordered a chicken burrito bowl ,and my husband ordered a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lower prices ,Son had chicken that was dry,35 for a tiny bag of chips,Guacamole for the chips another 1,steak had bit of zing ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The line move quickly and the food tasted the same,Usually airport food cost is substantially higher than the same,food out in the city,But this food was almost the same, as the chipotle restaurants I go to outside of the airport, as I'd pay at any other chipotle,I will definitely seek out chipotle if I'm ever in terminal,I wish they had the Tabasco Chipotle sauce to spice up my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The dining area was the standard sized room with barely enough tables to seat the people who are quickly being rushed through the food making station,my mind tells me that I shouldn't think twice when I can get a burrito about the size of a small,I'm glad I got my Chipotle fix but even my friend's daughter was left feeling a little hungry after slamming the less than gigantic burritos we ordered,Normally I get a heaping overflowing excessively large ladleful of rice,I barely got half a cup of rice ,and equally gargantuan portion of beans,and a meager sprinkling of beans, child for around $8-$10 with chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was beyond ecstatic to see that ATL's revamped food offerings included adding a Chipotle to the D concourse,but beyond that the food is subpar at best as others have described,I was upset that I wasted my money and ended up throwing a full burrito bowl away,The rice was undercooked,The steak tasted like it was a day old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a burrito ,I like chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I live right by this chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not to mention the food is always great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Three of the five ingredients I asked for in my burrito bowl needed to be refilled,The poor guy in front of me waited so long only to have the girl rip his burrito ,I saw two other customers with busted burritos,"I'll miss the ""natural"" chicken (the meat is actually processed in Chicago)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Snooty attitude from the girl making our food ,not a huge deal but didn't have guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One burrito bowl with half,brown and white rice,chicken,mild and medium salsa,cheese,sour cream,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the burrito bowls, Same goes for the rice, Some days the meat is seasoned great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had a chorizo/steak bowl,Nice portions as usually when you split your meats you get more of a portion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
& foot coordination you'll probably drop your food on the way upstairs,If you sit downstairs there's a high possibility that a bum is going to come inside & bother you for money or food,We all know Chipotle isn't top tier Mexican food,My cousin ended up taking his food back because it tasted like nothing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really want a taco,Maybe some chips ,and guacamole,Or a delicious salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This establishment is not a good place as they take a long time to attend and they give very few food rations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lady threw out two orders in front of mine then missed what I asked for three times before moving it down the line without the right ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle I've ever been too,I'm so loyal to chipotle due,When I asked them to make me a new bowl (because I can't eat dairy) they rolled their eyes ,and had cross contamination of sour cream in all their salsas,They were missing key ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Vegetarian Bowl Bowl as with the other food it was full,was the toughness of the tortilla around the burrito ,and how the tacos were jammed together in a tin foil 'packet' (,So we only enjoyed the tacos which we had to eat with a spoon:( Things arrived cold,One thing for sure is that they gave us tons of guacamole,Keto Bowls with steak had no steak,They evidently didn't have steak b/c they substituted the two steak Bowls for Vegetarian ones which cost a dollar less (each),The iceburg lettuce salad with guac was nothing special,We ordered thru doordash today a salad with quac, of onion and the guac was spiced in an unpleasant way for our taste buds,I think b/c our family doesn't eat Mexican except once in a blue moon that the spices tasted off ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As for the tacos the hard,Very unfortunate because I love chipotle, shells were also stale and the beans tasted straight out of the can,The mild salsa was sour,Guac tastes,frozen from the day before and tastes like ice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered the burrito bowl with chicken ,Can't imagine eating at a chipotle ever again in my life,Found a hair in my chicken,and there was a hair on one of the chicken pieces,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When they have your food it's ok, but you're consistently missing ingredients,and the service leaves a sour taste in your mouth the whole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
online it said chipotle would open at 8 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I understand that at lunch rush it is possible to run out of ingredients ,I come here all the time and am thoroughly impressed with the high quality service ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How does a chipotle run out of all 3,chicken,and chips,This Chipotle was out of cheese,Even if they are about to close they should still offer the same quality service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have eaten at least 5 burritos since, Made directly in front of you / to order (think subway) you choose what ingredients fill your massive burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I officially boycott chipotle today after dealing with the Washington st location in downtown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then they proceeded to tell me they were out of pinto beans ,During this exchange an employee was eating out of one of their plastic salsa containers over the prep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but there was a hamster in my food,I love chipotle,I always get a bowl with white rice,I took home my bowl ,and black beans,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a burrito with carne,rice,Was so watery I needed a bowl to catch the juice,black beans, corn salsa,cheese, sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a great place to get half of a Chipotle burrito for the price of a Chipotle burrito,Today they were missing all rice ,and a salsa,They are ALWAYS out of one or more ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  There is almost never a line at this location and I'm able to get in and out very quickly with my food,a few times I've noticed the chips ,and guacamole taste different at this location than other Chipotle restaurants (I think they don't put enough salt/lime juice in/on the chips/guacamole), We found that ordering online the portions aren't as stingy especially with the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The mysterious thing about their constant shortages is that there are always at least six people in the kitchen  and yet can't keep food on the line,no white rice,Tonight was the icing on the cake: No pinto beans,no steak,I don't know if this is a new company wide rule or what but they don't carry steak after 8 pm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Smaller portions/higher prices,They put hot salsa on my wife's bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A quick burrito dinner while shopping,The burrito was a little,light on the chicken today ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our food was a bit sloppy, but tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was great,You should probably consider a different general manager cause the one you have now obviously isn't mature enough to handle food properly,She must not care to much about the controversy chipotle just went through with E,The experience was overall great until of course the general manager Michele navarrete decided it was a good idea to grab a chip from the bin of freshly cooked chips not once ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a burrito ,She even asked me did I want it wrapped over I said yes and she just let everything fall out the burrito ,She wrapped it and the whole burrito wasn't even covered ,I use to work for chipotle ,I got home and was very unhappy because the rice ,and beans ended up all over the place ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The meal prep counter always has food smeared on it,and my bowl always has food dripping off the side or smeared on the bottom,corn salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She put cheese on my burrito ,instead of getting a new bowl she scooped it out of the bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food was decent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and proteins seemed very flustered since she was the one doing most of the work while the other girls were ""preparing"" the other food",One of the girls who was serving the rice,There was no white rice ,beans,the same goes for the beans,She kept serving customers black beans until I asked if there were pinto beans ,salsa,guacamole) was super,sour cream,The girl who was serving the toppings (lettuce, slow because she had to prepare/stock the lettuce in case they ran out in the next,I say that because the lettuce was full,at the station and she went to get 4 more tubs of lettuce one by one from the back to put underneath the lettuce station,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't go to this f*kingchipotle,This was a LARGE bag of chips UNTOUCHED ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the rice was raw,The guacamole in my meal was black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I eat at this Chipotle 4x a week cause of my hectic schedule and ease of fresh food (normally) ,Got rice bowl & explained I didn't want the meats to be piled on top of each other,Half the bowl carne asada ,The older woman who helped said ok and then mixed & piled the meats on top of each other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Guys work so hard and food never failed ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Still a pretty good value for airport food with some healthy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tried to get a veg burrito ,Definitely not the standard chipotle,but the were out of beans ,They seemed more concerned with making themselves cheese quesadillas than correcting the shortages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh and the food wasn't hot,I've frequented many chipotles in my life,Every other chipotle location I have been to has been clean,""" So I ordered a carnitas bowl ",It tasted ok ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but expect better especially for the price,"obviously the price would be reduced for this ""mystery option""",Toppings reversed on the bowl ,Thanks for the salad that had ZERO lettuce,and salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What more do you want from Airport food,Highly recommend as a tastier option to bad airport food,It tasted as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Decided to go with tacos, Got the three taco meal, This just meant that there was not much filling in the tacos,When they got to me they were so soggy that the bottom of all the tacos just fell out, They also put the sour cream on the outside of the tacos,I declined to get rice ,and beans, instead of a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So me and my son went to get food,I had my son go in and get my food since I'm sick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and instead got two burrito BOWLS,Today I gave this place another chance and ordered another two burritos for delivery,one burrito was WAY smaller than the other,One of them I ordered was steak but I ended up getting chicken ,and a few pieces of steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I have ordered chicken before ,and ended up with some other kind of meat that I did not ask for , I have also found gristle/ cartilage and a bone in the meat occasionally,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Airport prices for subst,I ordered a sofitas bowl ,and the guy almost dumped chicken in it,When we got to the salsas I asked for the medium one ,There was meat in the grilled,There isn't supposed to be meat in them,I hate cilantro and now my whole meal tastes like soap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My usual is a carnitas (also pronounced correctly) burrito with black,Kind of an ingenious way to deter non customers but functional for the people who plop down their $9 for a good burrito, beans,The extra charge for guacamole to the unknowing irks me ,cheese,sour cream ,and lettuce,Fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amazing and fresh food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always good,the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is always my go to quick service food,I totally understand they get busy and it takes time to make food ,First off I am a long time fan of chipotle,the chipotle in the Atlanta airport is almost always a disappointment,Out of rice,chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Great customer service and they really know how to make a steak bowl,He really knows how to make the best bowls , All the ingredients were delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just went there  for a carne asada burrito ,and the meat was still not ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a side of guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was seasoned well ,Priced right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wrong order (when ordered online and the ingredients are in WRITING),Missing ingredients- I ordered for 9:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Makes you wonder about the food prep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went in for a bowl ,and they didn't have half the ingredients that I wanted in the bowl,No guacamole,A Mexican place with no guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered the bowl with steak ,and chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then when I grabbed my food ,I love chipotle ,and I have gone to many chipotle restaurants,Once I started eating I noticed my rice & beans were both undercooked,The young man serving my meats was practically rolling his eyes ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I felt it lacked real flavor for the price sa,99 for a Chipotle asada bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they can't comprehend food allergies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered pork tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food bowl on the counter,was making bags of chips and told the person who prepared my food that she wasn't working this weekend because she was already sick, Great when you work with food,Went there for a simple bowl to take out, Person making the food said nothing to me except to ask the ingredients then tossed the closed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food on the other,I can see why this place has been getting bad reviews because of the food,I'd imagine my food has been sitting there for a couple hours,grainy rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and loaded up our burrito bowls with extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,My burrito:, -Light white or brown rice,I switch up the type of rice ,and I ask for light rice , -Pinto or black beans,and beans sometimes, -Red chili salsa, -Corn salsa, -Extra sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered a last minute single catering meal and it was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He made me my bowl even though it was my mistake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then the employee looked at me and continued to put on sour cream  and rolled up the burrito without even asking to remake it,While waiting 10 minutes while they filled online orders and seeing them get those orders wrong I saw them  scrape off chicken on the tacos ,and put another meat on to correct it leaving pieces of the other,meat behind,I specifically asked for no sour cream,"They put sour cream on after while in the act I said again ""no sour",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Been to this location twice and I look forward to a Coke Zero with my salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Could I have more food in my bowl please,4 bowls,large chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One employee was standing at the register doing nothing while to other employee was preparing the food ,Their counter was littered with food ,cheese ,They were out of lettuce,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The line move quickly and the food tasted the same,Usually airport food cost is substantially higher than the same,food out in the city,But this food was almost the same, as the chipotle restaurants I go to outside of the airport, as I'd pay at any other chipotle,I will definitely seek out chipotle if I'm ever in terminal,I wish they had the Tabasco Chipotle sauce to spice up my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my bowels are having a boxing match with food poisoning bacteria,even he wouldn't mess up throughly cooking chicken,So I'll probably lay off the chicken for a while ,and go for the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hardly any rice,Bowls have been significantly bellow the bottom line in the bowl,beans or veggies,I understand the meat is the most expensive,but very skimpy on all ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always out of chips,Usually out of one meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tomato salsa,Not sure if it was the meat seasoning or guacamole,Ordered a steak salad with guacamole,There was more guacamole than there was lettuce,I love guacamole ,sour cream & cheese,I was craving that fresh taste of a good salad so I ordered Chipotle to be delivered,Everyone loves a great Chipotle salad,The entire salad was extremely salty," Did not appreciate thinking ""well that was a waste"" as I threw the salad away",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
often over an hour late in opening and then is consistently out of most ingredients so you rarely end up getting what you actually wanted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food was delicious as always,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food tastes fine,Unless you're going in and carefully watching them put what you want in the bowl,We have no idea how they give us completely different ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They did an ok job with my burrito,She then proceeded to get only one quesadilla with lettuce from the counter stuck to it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Few foods I love more than a chipotle,PEAK hours they will have rookies on the line making burritos giving out either too much,If you intend on washing down your chipotle burrito wish a refreshing fountain soda then do not come to this location,Please for the love of everything that is holy DO NOT COME to this chipotle with your usually bomb chipotle, or too little of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last time eating chipotle from this location, Gave them another shot after not having corn or tomato salsa, This time I decided to order a salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 the food was tasty,I stopped in to pick up a chicken bowl,I also had ordered a small bag of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a burrito that I was able,It tasted just like any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Walked in and there was food from previous,I love chipotle so of course I will come back ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
collected his money and threw the food away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the same guy was prepping more food ,I was the only person in line today and the guy working would not let me speak without pushing me along both burritos like the place was on fire,"Let me just place my order without yelling ""what else"" every time I name an ingredient that I would like",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In another life I worked multiple sides of the food service ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff is very friendly and the food itself was very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a rice bowl with chicken veggies ,Received a bowl with beans lettuce ,and guacamole only,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Each of the hot food wells were over-cooked,Based on each associate's general lack of concern for customer service or food preparation,I asked if there were any more peppers and onions so I could order a veggie bowl,"""So you can't make a veggie bowl",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Basically they said ""all we have is chicken sir"" cmon",Staff was really unprofessional they boasted about not cooking anymore meat because they close at 10 while I was in line it was only 7pm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll add brown rice ,A sofrita bowl,I've tried to imitate the basic recipe starting with a bowl ,if I have beans at home,I will compensate by adding more salsa ,Or is it something in their mild or medium salsa,and a bucket of salsa,and cheese,And then I also skip out on the sour cream cause I don't have that stuff lying at home,Is it their sour cream that makes the difference,salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I drive past this location & drive to the one that is further from my home to get a decent bowl,but this location consistently over cooks the chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was mediocre,The rice ,I got the carne asada bowl,and beans were hard,The carne asada meat was nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No chips made,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We were told that a kids meal included two tacos,we were informed that the kids meal only included one taco for $4,we were charged for two single tacos ($5) ,chips,and did not receive chips or a drink,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food suffered badly in transit,Unless you like soggy tacos,missing chips,or queso that just tastes like paper mache glue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when we would have much rather had a Chipotle burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We got to the cashier and she tried to charge us $9 more than what the food we ordered should have cost,My daughter got the kids build your own taco meal ,and did not want rice or beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location is always out of food, 3 out of lay 4 time they are out of some critical food item,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 What is normally great food , The last time they told me they were out of brown rice , This last time a little tiny blob was put on top of my bowl ,"and when another worker could see the look on my face she suggested that the other girl ""scrape"" the bowl to get a little  more for me", Needless to say that left me with very little meat that was overcooked , The guacamole is $2, The girl that served me had to scrape the bottom of each pan to get ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5 stars - The food feels healthy,50) the deconstructed burrito is tiny, But the portions are small and the prices high,making up for the small portion size and price, Good with optional guacamole topping ($2,70) and guacamole ($2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The carnitas tasted like tuna and the spices carnitas tasted like dog food,I am a huge chipotle fan ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've had hair in my food,I've watched employees go from taking money right back to food prep without changing gloves,Rarely when I order online is my food ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you haven't ever tried the Barbacoa soft flour shell tacos,Everybody that ain't have gotten to try the barbacoa tacos changes their usual,go to order and is just like me-Barbacoa tacos everytime  Simply the best,sour cream and shredded cheese with a dab of sour cream on each  And I CANNOT ever go to a chipotle without getting the queso dip ,chunky mild salsa,and fresh tortilla chips,25 cents more and is triple the amount of queso and the larger bag of chips,And they're extra yummy to save any leftover chips/queso to have the next,light lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have chipotle at least once a week,This place is far from your typical chipotle,The people have a shitty attitude and I found tasted like it was cooked yesterday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can get my chicken burrito with side, guac and chips h,Top quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is one of the best chipotles in the city,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The meat is seasoned perfectly ,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They handed me a hot quesadilla in foil with a fork and did not offer a bag as they forgot my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The best part about it was there excuse was they were out of rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
miserable and doesn't wrap burritos well,My burrito quickly transformed into a pool of slop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never had any issues with getting my food this way,The older gal working the carry outs was kind and gave me extra cheese but why should customers have to go back and ask for their food to be made right,If you're going to go to this chipotle just st,i ordered a bowl with extra cheese and rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go to order and I ask for a bowl with white rice ,After she put chicken in my bowl,So instead of starting over with my bowl,then continued to use the same bowl that was now dirty,After she gets those in she automatically assumed I wanted chicken,I said that I didn't want chicken,she grabbed a small cup and scooped out the chicken over the garbage, all over the sides from the chicken being scooped out,and black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Was the price good,I figure since I had to add an addtl bowl Id wait my turn in line ,the lady in feont of me was comp'd her bowl ,they were soggy bowls ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always go to chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for more rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wonderful food as always,Very good prices compared to other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 This is now the second carnitas bowl which I order in which the server did not take the time to realize that at least half of the meat portion in my bowl was all fat,please sift thru your meat carefully before serving and make sure customers are not getting a glob of fat in their bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All the employees are friendly but food is either old,come here and you will find out within minutes of eating the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered the chicken salad to go (bc I can't always finish it ,My tummy growled from steak smell that hit my face as I entered this place,Asked for a scoop of steak as well ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was no one in line but the food serving area was a mes,chicken,and chips,steak,"""Hi we're out of lettuce",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of the food isn't the problem it's the missing food or wrong,Burnt dry steak instead of chicken,Constantly forgetting to put dressing in the bag for the salads I order, ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I read the reviews and apparently chipotle didn't get it right at this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great chipotle ,They did forget my salad dressing,Everything was fresh and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was still good,good for relatively healthy food on a budget,but things like the salsa wasn't as fresh,The lettuce looked like it came from a bag rather that being freshly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I travel a good  bit and Chipotle is one of my go to places because I am pretty confident that the food will be good,i ordered chicken ,In fairness to him I think they put the carnitas in the chicken station ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The young lady  making the burrito was stressed to the max (no help from the four or more people st,my chicken burrito was almost meatless,My question is how do you mess up a burrito, with tasteless beans and soggy rice not to mention the guacamole that turned brown before I got home,Normally I go the Braintree restaurant but since I live around  the corner from the R,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food may be good, but the service is horrible and I will not be going back to the Randolph Chipotle and I was really looking forward to my burrito too ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service was very slow and the food portions were ridiculously small,I had to ask the lady at the register if I could have a tray for my food ,This has to be by far the worst chipotle I've ever been to,She pushed it towards me and acted as if I asked her for more chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is by far the worst chipotle I have ever been to,This chipotle ,the corn salsa actually contained rotten,This most recent visit released on us the soggy chips,I won't have my chips soggy,but not the chips,the meat tasted like an ash, corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got my stuff and went back to the car and my rice was wrong,""" I walked in and asked for my stuff and the girl behind the counter wanted to charge me for the forgotten salsa",I look in the bag: no forks/no napkins/no sour cream on the side (like I said in my online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the food still sucked,also did not have a hot salsa or guacamol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is terrible,I've been to this chipotle before ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We came during a busy time so the food should have been fresh,-The steak wasn't cooked all the way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is pretty,so it's the closest chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't even bother eating at this chipotle anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the worst chipotles I've been to,Extremely slow and skimpy on rice ,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but 2 days in a row where they are slow and short on food around di,If we order a salad please fill the bowl with lettuce,we had to request on our 3 bowls to all get extra,Edit: from our 45 min drive to get chipolte we got home to find they did not close the bowls, BOTH days with it not being very busy we had to wait for carnitas and guacamole the first, lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- Ordering a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one thing is for sure - those chips got bagged - while one person making food had to keep running to the back for the prepped,food,as soon as I came in with my group he was asking for more rice up,then brown rice,Apparently the two counters of chips were not enough,then he had to get more guacamole as the rest of five crew members were filling up chip bags,then steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by the time my food got to me it was cold,One burrito was significantly smaller in terms of portion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and if they don't show up to pick up the food you have no options,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Standard Chipotle food,That great start continued when he pulled the fresh cheese ,and lettuce from the fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was very good,Most fast-food Mexican,etc) but the employees were very generous with the amount of product placed in my burrito, restaurants are skimpy on additives (meat,cheese,Very distinct taste of fresh ingredients which all Chipotles are known for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fast and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Told us food would be done at 8:30 I arrived 5 minutes early ,Lots of people left the line and this will definitely be my last trip to chipotle ,45 minutes for a rice bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I got my food,I ordered 10 tacos ,I realized they forgot rice on 6 of the tacos,They refunded us for 3 tacos,and chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And can anyone explain why my car now smells like Chinese food,I just threw away my burrito bowl,It looked like soup and not a burrito bowl,it will be a long time before I eat at any chipotle,The second bowl was missing veggies as well,I asked for chicken ,I got double meat - chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they have good food,They definitely skimp on the meat as compared to other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went there tonight 4-18-2019 around 5pm and there was a lady working here who don't know how to make a burrito ,I asked for extra sour cream and she laddled like 2 full ones on my burrito it was basically a soupy burrito ,00 for 2 burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food is never good,the rice seems dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When located I received my food I was very unhappy,quesadilla had no cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the half full bowl combined with a price increase to $9/bowl just justifies the fact that chipotle is the only,So this is a steak bowl after asking for more of each item,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and said enjoy the food in a very nice,and they get 2 stars for the food,And none of the food was hot,Maybe the worst chipotle food-wise I've been to,This place would get 5 stars if they would get the food situation under control,The rice is undercooked,they were completely out of black beans,almost out of pinto beans,they were out of hot salsa,almost out of every meat,they were out of guacamole (REALLY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We called chipotle ,I got chicken with rice-- not whole,We ordered 2 whole 30 bowls ,but got one bowl (definitely not whole,Instead of what I ordered (whole 30 bowl with barbacoa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and today they left the corn salsa off my bowl,Im not thrilled with paying $20 for a bowl without half the things I ordered on it,The last 4 visits I have not gotten the double meat that I ordered ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just want my food to be correct, First the chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The girls serving the food were so rude,this was nothing like chipotle,rice was over cooked,My bowl was tiny,their meat portion was half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,My co workers and I ordered our food online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My boyfriend got a burrito with double,His burrito was only half ,meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burritos ,Yummy tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I order the kid's taco plate,It comes with your choice of two soft or hard shell tacos,a side (chips or seasonal,three fillings (guacamole does NOT cost extra,My guacamole serving was huge,I get to saunter over to the pick-up corner to the left of the counter while everyone else,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is like subway but for Mexican food,Most places just for beans and rice for those that are vegan/vegetarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go to the car and eat realizing that my rice was wrong,I ordered two bowls through the line,When we opened the bag there was only one fork for two bowls,I opened my bowl ,obviously they just gave me the wrong bowl,I've come to this location a few times and almost every time there is some small issue like they forgot salsa or lettuce or something,and they've forgotten my sour cream my corn salsa ,and my extra mild salsa so I go back at this point a little,but with an attitude I then asked if she could give me extra of the mild salsa that I ordered ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Probably my least favorite chipotle out there,because I love chipotle ,the guacamole is sometimes frozen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Workers are nice but I'd rather then be snarky and whip up a good burrito,This chipotle always seems to disappoint,The chicken is either undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but literally all of the girls at the food line were all super,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They questioned my husbands order of chicken burrito ,Excited for you a date night with my hubby and to try the new califlower rice,Oh and I might recommend the califlower rice ,ok no problem to be healthier BUT I get one tiny scoop of it that did not cover even the bottom of my bowl,and opened it up to find ummm chicken,only lettuce,but I couldn't taste it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Back in 2011 this was probably one of the best chipotles too,now it's dirty and you instantly fail when you give me hard uncooked rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The meat in both our food was ICE COLD,Stopped by and got a bowl and burrito to go,I live one block from this chipotle ,"The lady on the phone laughed and said ""we temp our meat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's like snails make the food,The food is okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Arrived to pick up order with ample time to have 1 bowl ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice,Mine had chicken,black beans,and I asked for the medium salsa,I was nervous (not a huge fan of salsa verde),When I saw the mild salsa (fresh,I was pleasantly surprised at the taste of the mild salsa,I was glad I added the mild salsa,cheese,It tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They're always out of food and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Out of corn ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 the food was excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Double wrapped soft tacos that are cold in the middle,a bowl that is the same,Half of the time I get stale chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a burrito bowl with double,a FAT burrito,Granted I love burritos ,I ordered a bowl with chicken and veggies and got that plus white rice,fajitas and rice , steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of the food they were serving basically smeared ,I had to ask them to pick up my burrito because they were planning on dragging it across a days worth of food left on the counter,This is the slowest and nastiest chipotle I have ever seen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a burrito,there was a frozen piece of chicken in my burrito,I thought I'd give chipotle another try ,It's pretty obvious that chipotle isn't paying their management very well,so it had that raw dough taste along with it being super,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Didn't realize until all the food was back home,had to go back to the store receipt in hand and get the correct food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food ,their food happens to be made fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Luckily they had enough food to put together our very large,everyone enjoyed the food,In any case - food was good,not to mention the poor person having a heart attack when they show up to get the food ,beans,So - they had to wait while they assembled everything - meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went again today and they have no burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The last THREE times I've been there they have run out of some kind of meat by 7pm, This is despite the fact that they have 8 employees standing around doing nothing while they wait for the meat to cook,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and that fake big grab they do they is supposed to give the appearance that they are going to load up your food item ,Your food is ok,Always like warm and no matter what store I visit they act put off that you actually would like a lil food for your money,Ok so been eating at chipotle for years ,it ridiculous to ask for a lil more every time they put something in your bowl ,they must beat their employees at night if they give away a extra corn kernel ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was great,I haven't even eaten my food yet because I needed to leave this review,Literally the best service I've ever had at a chipotle, and literally my favorite chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husbands burrito came ice cold ,I'm vegan and I ordered a burrito bowl without cheese,It came with tons of cheese and I ordered extra guacamole that never came,I picked as much cheese off as I could see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't feel like fried seafood, I did feel a little explorative and what better way than to try chipotle for the first,We have heard about those chipotle cases a while back where customers got sick,but I got a Steak Bowl with white rice, The portion was more than I expected for a small bowl, I shouldn't have eaten the whole bowl though, I had lots of beans ,black beans,hot salsa,guacamole ,sour cream,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Asked about the rice ,"and was told ""just pick one"" paid for chips ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pay the same amount for half the amount of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This review is not based on the food,This location is just like many other chipotles with keeping the food they serve delicious,I get the steak tacos or the steak,they had run out of crunchy taco shells by 7pm on a slow,I have been really wanting a chipotle out this way for a long, bowl most times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle on the planet,On top of that they refused to take my cash and said chipotle only takes cards now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When we go to order our food they took my husb,When we had finished our food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Felt rushed the entire way the line: the guy in front of me wasnt given enough time to say ""burrito ple","The guy ahead of me and I were asked at the same time: "" okay you two guys while or brown rice",""" 1) we weren't together 2) the person ahead of him hadn't the time to step past the rice",black or brown beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoyed my veggie tacos at Chipotle Mexican Grill and prefer them over the burritos or bowls,"Of course they complied when I asked them to add more veggies to the ""vegetarian tacos"" ",I noticed that they try to pile on the rice ,My daughter did not have rice ,and to back off of the rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food wasn't ready,They didn't start making my food until this point,The food was running low,I'm really disappointed in this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the bottom of the bowl has completely broken with food ,I was in that chipotle for 45 minutes,get a bowl ,and salsa spilled all over my seat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very pricey ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They had no chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had stomachache twice shortly after eating their steak salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Missing our drinks and chips,they're out of chips too,Just that they can replace the chips with extra,But we didn't want extra drinks and already paid for the chips ,and guacamole,I had to ask to at least get the guacamole part,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pre-ordered online for co-worker to carryout bowl, For $7 the bowl wasn't even filled to the top, I think they owe her a new bowl or she can do like I do ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can't believe this is chipotle,As you can see in my picture there is no cheese on the quesadilla,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the place looked like a bomb went off - most of the ingredients were empty on the food line,food scraps ,the food actually tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The second star is because my daughter was happy with her bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my food for pick up ,The food was also not the best,I'm a huge chipotle fan in general,I ordered chicken and I had like 5 pieces in my bowl,I felt robbed :( as well as there was a hair in my bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One burrito at a time,25 for a burrito ,how come my burritos,I'm convinced my last burrito from this location weighed more than I did at birth,White or brown rice,and guac in a bowl for $6,Black or pinto beans,50 for extra meat,Can I just get extra meat,why is guacamole extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I ordered food ,My food left at 11:50 ,My food is cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was exactly what you expect from a Chipotle,so no complaints there- however- they were out of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They rolled my burrito up like mad,Yo this chipotle was the dopest of the dope, tight and that shit was stuffed with ingredients fresher than the Prince of Bel-Air,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not that they can even make a burrito,The burritos always fall apart,Its slooped togehter with runny beans,mild salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The experience was good made better with a good meal of beans and rice with chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But also I don't load it with everything there and the number 1 thing is that they need to learn how to keep food hot,I honestly don't like chipotle that much,I only had chipotle no more than 2 or 3 times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came in 5 minutes after my scheduled pickup time and watched the entire line go down before they even started making my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a bowl and they gave me a burrito,I open up the burrito only to find a dead,This chipotle is always screwing up orders for delivery every time my job orders through them as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Where are people's food,I go inside to pick up my food ,They should be able to track who is here so they can just hand you your food,I'm not sure why chipotle lane takes so long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Save some food for the people you fat ass's & you wonder why they run out of food ,There are other chipotles & other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible food ,I wish I could give this chipotle a 0 star,I have tried so many different locations and always happy with chipotle ,I ordered through Uber and for my bowl chose no rice ,They couldn't think of maybe having more lettuce rather than a slight sample of lettuce since there was no rice,and empty bowl ,Just some beans with fajita,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've ordered a salad several,I went there and ordered another salad ,I was halfway into finishing the salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a steak burrito bowl,when I only excluded beans-I have taken screen,Without beans only,She also agree that it was a strange system of online order error (it showed for Chipotlet that I excluded everything but steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle always skimps on food,My $12 keto bowl had barely any lettuce,but they piled on the spicy red salsa on my to go order,or guacamole,steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems like they're always missing ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Friendliest staff and awesome food,This is the best chipotle in ATX,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I opened the bag I found no utensils given and a very skimpy bowl of food that cost over $11,The food tasted good,but they did slather on a bunch of red salsa more than anything else,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a plant protein salad with black beans,and salsa,Also got a side of guacamole,cheese,sour cream, There was hardly any lettuce , I ate mostly around the soggy lettuce because I was super, I thought a salad seemed really tasty,When I opened up the container what I saw did not resemble a salad,Not sure why Chipotle has salads listed on their menu if they are incapable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fresh guacamole is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and so has my boyfriend and we each find meat in our food ,but just a little disappointing i can't get my food delivered from here anymore,Although i love this chipotle ,i always find steak or chicken in my VEGAN bowl,I've tried over 4 times and each time there's meat in it),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What I received: burrito,burrito,that takes a special kind of stupid when the order ticket is on the burrito wrapper as you're making it,NO rice,lots of rice,What I ordered: paleo lifestyle bowl (lettuce,bowl (lettuce, The damn bowl has five things in it , No modifications allowed on lifestyle bowls so it should only be slightly more difficult,What I ordered: bowl, I am especially impressed that they found a way to mess up bowl vs,do you think the same person who can't comprehend putting five things in a bowl is magically able,chicken,black beans,pinto beans,tomatillo-green chili salsa ,salsa),hot salsa, to make than a bag of chips,and guacamole),guacamole,lettuce x2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle for some reason can never get my order correct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I ordered on the app and picked up our food order at the drive thru for my family while running err, So we are left paying for food we did not receive, I guess quality customer service is slim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
During the 20 minutes we waited on our food we saw the same,Your job is to serve burritos not power trips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they cooked up the meats at the grill parallel of the food line,The gal working the food line wasn't friendly,It's not in a food court area though,the chicken in my salad was precooked,The chicken was literally cold,so I picked out each piece of chicken from my salad,The chicken was almost frozen,What about guacamole,Before you get all judgey and question that the lettuce made it cold,Once I told her my protein and that I wanted the salad,I wonder what was included in the salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered online food it was given to me late,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a burrito bowl,My son ordered a burrito,chips , They clearly didn't drain the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Won't order from this location ever again they are always either out of Major ingredients or they screw up my order -I'm don,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the food at Chipotle,But this is the second time getting cold food there,though it seems their rice ,rice ,and meat are barely lukewarm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and each time I go they charge me a different price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grab yourself extra napkins to hold your plate because the bottom of your bowl will have smooshed food all over it,I'm looking forward to trying you guys again with MANY improvements because I personally always loved chipotle,walked over to the first gal (the gal at the rice+protein,hence my empty bowl of rice,You bet I took both bowls back for a refund,as she shows her a flat spoon of chicken," position) and says ""we are out of ingredients and running low on certain meat","so you have to portion it down on the meat""","The gal with the genius ""give them less meat"" idea straight up smirked",I just pray I don't get sick because their sour cream was not only warm,The only common ingredient we had was sour cream,They were out of fajitas & lettuce,I kindly asked the cashier if he can not charge us the extra charge for quac since they were out of 2 main ingredients,"My husband turns to me and says ""where's that lime taste coming from",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Ordered a burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I should've kept walking ‍  My steak was cold and the rice tasted like beans even though I didn't even have beans on my bowl ‍  even my queso was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
second visit to this location and the food was inedible,This was my worst chipotle experience ever,I ordered a chicken salad ,My husband also got a chicken salad (with different,I know this is a new location but hopefully they get their quality control h, toppings) and his tasted really soapy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Chipotle's food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
white rice instead of brown,It was incomplete (no chips + salsa- had to get refunded for that portion in cash),and inaccurate (missing ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they would've just dumped the burnt hot steak on top of the now cold rice ,and beans they'd started on,they started on my order and then just let it sit there while they burnt the steak I was waiting on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If it's past 6pm and you're craving Mexican food,food was 30-40mins late,Idk if this is the way chipotle works or this particular,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burrito ,I watched as the girl behind the counter scooped up the SMALLEST spoonful of rice ,even more dangerous virus was discovered and that we would have to be on a stricter lockdown so she decided to keep the extra rice ,Today we ordered a bowl,and then beans into the tortilla,and beans for herself,and chips & guac,"I heard the cashier tell the three workers on her side ""chips ",Also the chips were so stale,the guacamole was MISSING,I can confidently say that this branch does not carry out the same standard of quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I then keep checking all of the bags set out wondering if maybe so missed my name on the bags because at 6:57 my food still wasn't there,They were cracking apart when we tried opening the foil and were basically little chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for extra rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after returning home with our food,We ordered steak burritos ,The burrito was monstrous,The cashier was not very friendly but the girls making the burritos were friendly enough,The white rice was unavailable,They did have brown rice so we went with that,we found out the brown rice was undercooked,undercooked rice ,and beans,I also wished they had queso and a salsa bar like Moe's does,and a side of chips with Guacamole,You get more meat ,I ordered steak ,I will say that the few morsels of steak that I had were tasty,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food I s hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rips me off completely and then argues while literally throwing my food at me,Charge me full price for a bean ,and cheese bowl (seriously,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a steak burrito , I love chipotle in general,and they put half a scoop of steak so I asked for some more ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But most importantly the food has always been good,I've been going to this chipotle since it opened,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kinda wish I didn't pay for it immediately before I got my food,Oh also out of steak,Not to mention you are always out of salad dressing,even tho I'm getting a salad,Other than that it tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is the same,they are going to make the food you ask them to, quality as other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know they're getting a lot of heat lately about food safety,with all the great local Mexican food options available,I find myself favoring Chipotle because the food is great,Now if they can just work on their food safety issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is always good,I counted 6 chunks of chicken on my burrito,the gentleman serving the meat portions is used to feeding birds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food,After I brought my VISA up to her and she refunded the amount I then asked about my food,We left without food,Upon arrival we wanted to wash our hands before ordering food,food safety is something that should be addressed treated,and ready to enjoy a couple burrito bowls,There was cooked white rice ,I had to ask for meat on my bowl ,After a bite in each of our bowls with the romaine lettuce naturally layered on top,When looking down at our bowls,It was clogged with urine and the side of the bowl was visibly soiled with vomit,and chicken (,he brought to my attention that our lettuce was covered in dirt-- unwashed,He told her that we would be okay by picking it off but wanted the problem addressed since we noticed the holding pan for lettuce was nearly empty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I can't fault the food for it,This place serves great burritos with high,The guacamole is pretty,and they use romaine lettuce, quality ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They don't overstuff the burritos,all of the ingredients are well prepared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cashier dumps my burrito bowl in a bag ,This is the first time I've had a odd experience at a chipotle,which I've never had before at any other chipotle so I was grossed out,I noticed my bowl was extremely watery,and then takes a bag of chips from behind ,I was grateful for free chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who ever doesn't love chipotle is out of their mind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,But unfortunately this chipotle store is a disappointment,All other chipotle stores liberally add the items to the bowl ,so that took up most of the space in my bowl,My guacamole had two huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The price is a bargain $6,25 and you will get good size of bowl,She won't give you bell peppers and onions unless you ask even for Veggie bowl,the mild salsa,the spicy salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
affordable food,We usually get the food to go,  I can usually get two meals out of one burrito bowl, They will gladly give you extra rice,beans, You pay a little more for extra meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food tonight was coming apart before I even opened the foil,The lines used to just cruise and they could really wrap a good burrito,If your job is to wrap a burrito then you should probably try a bit harder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location is pretty consistent with the food quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went here for my lunch break and ordered a burrito bowl,The customer in line in front of me also had a burrito bowl ,The server looked down at the two bowls and quickly put a cover on the customer's burrito bowl,She tossed the bag with my burrito bowl in it ,She never offered if I wanted to add chips or a drink to my order (which I did) ,I accepted a long time ago that guacamole is of an extra,and had a heaping serving of guacamole,The server stopped serving me (didn't finish adding or offering ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
blah service and ok food I will stick to my back up TACO BELL across the street,now about the eating experience got a Chicken bowl ,fast forward to me finishing my bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They usually always have enough food on h,but that doesn't mean that they didn't run out of food from time to time,mostly steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Food was good and staff was nice however the rice could of cooked a little,the chicken had some burnt, longer and the chips were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thankfully there are a lot of really good Mexican food carts nearby,so there are other options for the discerning burrito connoisseur,Can't eat there anymore after I witnessed an employee sitting in the window preparing the bags (way under-filled and overpriced) of chips,then eating some chips,holy guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I walked out with a half burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hire more quality workers so you're lines move quicker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then they threw my food like I ran out of their ingredients,They better hope that another fast casual burrito place doesn't roll in town,there is barely any brown rice,Two weeks ago they were out of all rice at 7pm,Therefore I get the smallest portion of a bowl ever,Then I get to the toppings and they barely give you an salsa,There was no lettuce so I asked,"""are you getting more lettuce",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never been disappointed by portion sizes or food quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another thing - I don't usually comment about the amount of people working because it's irrelevant to the food/service you get,it's not too much to ask at a build-your-own burrito place to do,They don't give you enough time to think about what toppings you want on your burrito/taco/bowl,I politely asked for a hard-shell taco inside of a soft-shell,taco ,There are lots of places that sell double-decker tacos,They acted like they didn't want to accommodate my ridiculous over-the-top request but they ended up slopping my tacos together anyway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
although the serving sizes were a little skimpy on my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have ordered the bowl to go opened,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was told the last time I went I would have one free burrito left on my Chiptopia card,I went today and most certainly didn't receive a free burrito,They didn't honor the last free burrito I worked so hard,and currently eating my burrito with a bitter,The manager gave me a free drink (after having paid for my burrito ,"just like the non-free ""free"" burrito I was promised",Most expensive free burritos in town,and chips & salsa), taste in my mouth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I personally love ordering the burrito bowl,but then again I feel like any chipotle locations have that same,So first you get to pick the kind of rice you want,It's great that they have brown rice now available,but my go-to will always be the white rice, Then your type of red or black beans, I LOOOOVE their corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aftr visiting d zoo we planned to hve some food,D frst place we visited was chipotle,Awsum rice bowl vth carnitas,Food tastes really delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a large portion of food ,One of the worst experiences at chipotle,Today I did the Portland bridge pedal and was very hungry for a big meal figuring chipotle would do the job,The guy who first served me gave me the smallest portion I have ever seen at chipotle (just because I'm a woman doesn't mean I'm on a diet,I love chipotle,that was not a good chipotle experience whatsoever ,If anyone knows chipotle they know that their menu hasn't changed except for the addition of sofritas,The rice ,and beans should be an adequate amount to fill a layer of the bowl then the guy passes my chicken bowl to another worker (who I asked for more chicken from because the guy gave me half a spoonful and then I asked for sour cream and she literally put an entire scoop of that huge ass spoonful onto my very small portion of rice,portion size has gone down with recent price increase,beans,and meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Considering it was two dollars extra to ruin my burrito,but I got the worst guacamole here I've ever had,And none of those other ingredients that were supposed to be in there,but this tasted like neither,No avocado taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every other location look like they are counting how many bits of steak they put in my bowl ,Absolutely the biggest helping of steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food comes hot,and it's shiny and efficient and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The burrito I got at the Clevel,and Circle Chipotle had way too much rice,and barely any meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They gave me a tiny bit of rice in my tacos ,the guy put a ton on one of my tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the burrito assemblers are usually pretty happy,half one meat/half another,extra cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not to say the food is slow,tasty food,For just under $6 depending on the meat choice and whether you want your burrito in the form of a salad,rice, bowl or not,When I feel the need to increase my intake of veggies and good protein I go for their vegetarian salad bowl ($5,black beans,chucky tomato salsa,corn salsa,shredded cheese and guacamole,Their guacamole is delicious,cream cheese,60): Roman lettuce,and health conscious ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Carnita bowl is awesome, I love the chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is good,or just looked at the dining room and opted to get the food to-go, What I wouldn't give to be able to throw some in my burrito,but it's still just that little something that takes away from my typical burrito experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a burrito bowl,I am a big chipotle fan ,I just wish the portion size was better (I am probably the only person alive to ever say that about chipotle),gimme some rice ,You would think they are giving you their own rice ,and beans,and beans out of their own,I just feel like I should get at least one half way full spoonful of ingredients :( Also,And the guac tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
order your burrito,http://www.chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
scraps of food were on the floor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,recently had their veggie burrito w/ no rice,it was fresh and in the price range I want,Their tortilla chips are bomb,tastes fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just found a bug crawling in my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Portions are awful along with burnt chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prices are high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Slopped my taco together ,Given attitude when asked for fresh chicken,"and the ""fresh chicken"" was refrigerator cold",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is cheap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  The food is also made sloppy, It's okay food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food wasn't ready,Despite my food not being ready,I was at Kaiser across the street and wanted a burrito bowl, I'm still giving it a good rating because the staff was very friendly and accommodating when I asked for extra on my bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dominique that works there has an awful attitude and very poor customer service and didn't even give me a full spoon of guacamole and she made my tacos sooo messy ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Loved the food,the portions have shrunken and I have often had to ask for more of one ingredient or another,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I typically don't like the meat at any chipotle,or chips (just a little, too salty for my taste) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They give very little portions and the food (specifically the meat) is somewhat bland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prepare to experience burrito nirvana,Chipotle is all about quality of ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is mediocre at best,the food tastes pretty decent,so I don't realize what's wrong with my food until my 15 minute,and I couldn't eat my burrito bowl,whenever I ask for extra rice instead of getting beans,and I opt for more rice,rice is so super,undercooked rice(,I've had undercooked chicken,because the last three times I had their black beans,no more beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also grab a burrito bowl ,I think this is one of the better chains to grab a burrito rather than Moe's or Lime that is also nearby,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The last three times I've been there I've gotten the same crappy service and low quality food,and the food reflects that,I went in with my grandmother today and almost asked them to remake my burrito however didn't bother because the staffed seemed irritated,The rice was not fully cooked and I suffered through my burrito which was soggy,I'm a really great fan of chipotle ,I will avoid this chipotle in the future , and completely wet because the person who made it slopped on green salsa that looked very old,The mild salsa tasted old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great service the food taste better than other,chipotle I been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fresh healthy food that is super,It is not really what most people would think of as mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a salad with plain white rice,Once I opened the bowl at home I realized not only did they not include the vinaigrette but also the rice,chicken,cheese with the vinaigrette on the side,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the barbacoa burrito with white, rice,It is a bit pricey,The option of ordering a bowl ,black beans,I also like the fact that they are not cheap when it comes to serving you a good amount of whichever your choice of meat is,and choosing what meat ,guacamole ,cheese,and sour cream,delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my food online for pickup during lunch,was able to skip the entire line and my food was ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Carnitas was served in a frozen meat that I saw ice flake,inside the meat,Carnitas tastes too salty ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place is always busy and I am always pleased with both the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had the burrito bowl, which is awesome being that It's a giant burrito in a bowl without the tortilla, Love all the fresh ingredients and homemade chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What I love about chipotle is it's always fresh,Chicken salad bowl,I got the chicken salad bowl bc I was doing no carbs,I love their guacamole so I always have to get a side of that but you don't even need the chips,I do think even with the salads they should chop up the lettuce to a more manageable,The salad dressing is fantastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The tone they used while making our food was incredibly rude,Not to mention my friends guacamole was completely sour and so she had to throw her food out,my burrito was completely bl,I'll stick to the chipotle closer to my house,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tiny burritos,huge burritos,insanely salty chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delicious food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then I saw someone else walking straight to cashier and got her food ,chipotle websi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My standard expectation for a Chipotle restaurant are fresh food,I tend to prefer Chipotle over any other quick food restaurants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today I waited 15 minutes in line (which seems more due to slow service than demand) and ordered a veggie bowl with brown rice, I asked for half the normal rice, At that point they dropped a hug glop of brown rice in my bowl ,Eating it - the brown rice was overcooked , I pointed out that it was VEGGIE bowl ,and the person behind the counter begrudgingly added a few more peppers and passed the bowl on, Note that I've just watched the last five customer get HUGE meat portions without asking  - it's like they don't understand the concept of a veggie bowl, The bowl is looking obviously under filled , I asked for extra pinto beans , They gave me a small spoon of beans ,All the salsas,and the guacamole had big,no cheese or sour,I get half a handful of lettuce - ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
college kids) and very few decent food places to frequent,"This is my favorite ""guilt free"" burrito of the bunch",)  Love the burrito bowls-one of my favorite,rice, Mmmmm chicken,beans,salsa, (Talking about the organic meat etc,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also sweeping food from the tables onto the floor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food is generally spot-on with the occasional dry steak or chorizo but never crunchy rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered three tacos ,and the girl barely gave me any meat on my tacos,It was about one chunk of meat on each taco,I asked for more meat and she said I would have to pay for double meat which is the price of 6 tacos,I refuse to pay $16 for three tacos,leaving the tacos right there on the counter,If I am going to pay money for tacos,I deserve to be served a reasonable amount of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle I've ever been to,I'm pretty sure a majority of people go to chipotle for the guac,Definitely my only bad experience at chipotle ,the chicken is rarely fresh,2 out of the 3 times I've been there they said they didn't have guacamole,My friend once paid for an avocado cause they were out of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  In regards to my food it was not up to temperature in regards to rice ,Trying to eat healthily so  stopped in for a barbacoa bowl at 540,Only guy in the place    Order my bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the floor was littered with bits of food,and the sour cream and salsa on the side were barely filled to 1/3 the cups they came in,meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they apparently pride themselves on not having all ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality is always consistent,This is my go-to chipotle in South Austin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I took full advantage of chipotles burrito bowl,this is one of the best chipotles,it is a clean and dependable chipotle,brown rice,I got a half chicken half steak,black beans,Everything was pretty in line with expectations but the steak was a little,lettuce and cheese,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You're at a chipotle,He should have just filed a complaint with chipotle corporate,Always get the chicken bowl,It's funny what the other reviewer was complaining about: the level of done-ness of his steak,They didn't have a waiter come to your table to ask you how you would like your steak,It's something i know is of good quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not traditional mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just for a gigantic baby-sized Steak burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My only complaint to chipotle is that I get a veggie burrito,but yesterday I paid $8 for a half size burrito ,if I don't want a lot or any rice,I wish they would give me a lot of lettuce ,when I ask for a lot of lettuce,its delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fresh food,but the chicken's not bad, My husband likes the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have no choice but to stay away from Chipotle from now on and stick to my memories of the days years ago when the food was delicious,The lime taste to the rice was the best and the burritos weren't in the shape of a ball,My whole burrito ,I remember when I first discovered chipotle 14 years ago in Arizona,I attempted to fix it by adding the chipotle flavored tabasco,I asked a friendly employee for the chipotle or green,The rice had no taste at all,Not to mention that the rice was mushed up ,No salt or taste to rice,and my husband's bowl was completly bl,chicken,or salsa,steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why--WHY did you make me a sub-par burrito bowl, You were out of steak --just ran out one bowl before mine--, So I had to order chicken, And then you went skimpy on the lettuce--not good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Great food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uncool chipotle,The chicken was super,One guy put 10 lettuce leafs in my salad ,I said yes because it's a salad and then he took 5 mins to get new lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is of course great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Regardless of who owns it or what type of food it is defined as,I live for their burrito bowls,"I like to scoop some of my burrito ""insides"" up into chips to add a little",Their chicken has this great, smoky kind of flavor and just slightly spicy so you can taste everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
every time Ive been there the manager was walking around and asking folks how was their food,I love chipotle, I love the rice, I always get the veggie bowl with extra rice ,and the beans ,and the salsas, I go loco for the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How does a Chipotle run out of guacamole,They've run out of lettuce - just run by Kroger ,They've also run out of corn,My biggest problem is how often they run out of ingredients,If the management can get it together and keep ingredients in the store,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food isn't that good,beans and rice are incredibly bland,but there's no excuse for bland meat and beans,cheese or sour cream you'll finally be able to realize that their meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They resume- then one of the workers made her own bowl,Every bowl made was a mess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go to chipotle at least 2-3 times a week because their ingredients are so fresh and the food is fantastic,in my burrito,If you want the great taste that chipotle offers ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you going to get a burrito try Boloco or even Boca gr,Other people on this site have said that they get free range chickens ,At least you will have a higher quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything was cold (rice,I got a steak bowl,steak),It tastes,line is insane and taste a thous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle deserves these 5 stars because they give you so much food in a bowl compared to my recent,experience with a Mexican food truck named Tortilla who gave less,It may be because I've eaten Chipotle longer than the Tortilla Food Truck to know the customer service is good and the food has improved lately,I'm getting more food in a bowl than for $9,which I didn't care for but at least they make up for it with the other meats ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 If I'm paying $13 for a rice bowl I would expect better,they were out of organic chicken, There was no steak on the line done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went in to get a burrito bowl ,Didn't want to bother so I just walked out side enjoyed my bowl ,and chips ,I walk out side to enjoy my meal well the chips were under cooked ,the chips were white,but didn't even bother to continue to try and eat my stale chips,pay attention to your chips,and as a result tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The pinto beans and rice were very bl,and tasted as jf no salt added all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And extra salsa,the staff is friendly and they never roll their eyes when I ask for extra sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
courteous and quick and the food was pretty much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they barely drain the black beans before throwing them on your burrito ,I got a burrito with a bunch of super,This place would be good if they put your burrito together like someone who is about to eat a burrito,The problem is that some of the ingredients were lukewarm both times and the rice had super hard, hard rice kernels (please replace the rice ,Also they need to switch out ingredients more so they stay fresh,but the people who work here need to take the freshness of their ingredients more seriously,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 With all of the negative press that chipotle has had this year,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I asked for more rice,What Chipotle rations freaking rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They give plenty of meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 There are such great places out there for quick affordable mexican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and ordered a steak burrito, The portion was hearty for the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been here 3 times 2 of the times I got my food ,I created the same burrito as the first,2 times however the guy folding my burrito couldn't fold it so he asked another gentleman to help him fold it the man took my burrito off the line to the prepping table ,and tried rolling it and after also failing to do so he decided to thin the burrito out so he could fold it however I expected him to throw out some of the stuff in my burrito to make room ,but instead he proceeded to eat some of the chicken in my burrito until it was foldable,  I am never going back to this chipotle ever again ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was good, There's something about that burrito bowl that gets me every time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is a nasty and angry  food server who treats customers horribly,This worker looked at my son with a very angry face and didn't say a word just stared at him and banged his large food serving  spoon on the metal food container,I told him I wanted half chicken half barbaqua bowl,My wife told the black guy with the beard she wanted half chicken half barbaqua,"I repeated what my wife said loudly ""she wants half chicken half barbaqua""",My son said he wanted half chicken half beef plate,The worker asked him several times about each item then he looked at me and then back at my son he took 4 pieces of chicken ,"There you go"" and he took a few pieces of chicken with his spoon ",More meat,"can you put more meat please"" the worker said ""do you want double",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm very fortunate to have this quality food establishment that will serve me at off hours of the day ,when local food cart options aren't available,But showing up at 3:00 or 3:30 and being presented with an attitude when trying to pay for a single burrito with a single,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was picking up food for my son who was at home ,I just waited 30 minutes in line and they had no sour cream ,I literally had to stop at Kroger afterwards to buy sour cream,the lettuce the did have was pale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plus the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quality and deliciousness that I can't deny,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A lot of food for the money, It's what happens when you get a decent meal for a decent price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My ""chicken"" burrito bowl had no chicken",Another got a burrito bowl ,when he ordered a burrito,and yet another was given corn salsa ,They gave us more chips than we ordered as well,and no side of sour cream,no lettuce,My coworker ordered extra lettuce ,and got no lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems to be rotating new staff in every week and they can't or don't listen to orders well and constantly forget the salad dressing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My usual order is the chicken burrito bowl,once a year they offer BOGO chipotle bowl or burritos to nurses who wear scrubs with their badge,everyone who ordered chicken had to wait an extra 10 minutes almost so the manager passed out BOGO chipotle cards for our time spent waiting,You can get extra cilantro lime rice (white,chicken, or brown) and/or extra black or pinto beans at no charge,but it's extra for double meat - chorizo,Always get the guacamole on the side because you receive a more satisfying,steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food is so flavorful,I once saw a worker barely put any rice on the man's burrito ,I've had to ask for more scoops of rice also,From the chicken to the corn ,The other locations either taste burnt or have no flavor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Be prepared to wait over 30 minutes to get your food,Then they will probably also be out of brown rice ,and chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 the food always seem fresh, i usually get the burrito bowl which is like a huge,burrito,BUT chipotle is really really good, the rice has a nice,the meat always tender,salad-style without the wrap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took a few visits before the workers stopped giving me crazy looks when I ask for no beans and no rice on my steak burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love coming here because the food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food had no taste,This is the closest chipotle to me,but it seems to be the worst in the area mainly because it just doesn't taste as good as other chipotles,the tomatoes in the salsa were mealy ,the parking situation is difficult due to the low number of spaces and tight corners,and tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is great,but the service is comically bad compared to the plethora of other chipotles I've gone to,which is frustrating because it's the closest chipotle to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How can you go wrong with chipotle,It's always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basically you have a few menu items that you select (burrito,burrito bowl,Portion sizes are fine for the price (approx,salad) and you tell them what you want in it starting with a meat then type of beans,salsa ,and any extras like cheese,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's unfortunate because I have so very few food options working in this neighborhood,"Everyone who eats at this location probably orders the ""burrito bowl""",so the workers easily get out of practice on building the fattier option -- basically 90% of the time getting a burrito is just a total,Last time the black beans were half-cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its expensive but you get a HUGE burrito, They are SO STINGY with portions it is ridiculous and the rice ,and beans are always cold,Burritos are half the size and even the quesadillas are thin and only half full of cheese (also cold),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Try other burrito places on S Lamar Blvd, They don't cook enough meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle was sub,Slow workers and under seasoned meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can add complimentary cilantro to your food - ,The servers are trying to get rid of the extra salsa,meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So even though the burritos ,and tacos are great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Decent chipotle,I've found that the portions I get here seem bigger than other chipotles ,The ambiance is typical chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They gave me taco lettuce instead which wasn't very good,They were out of brown rice,I wanted to order a salad but they were out of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Friendly staff and always make my chicken burrito perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and half the time the staff at this one does NOT know how to properly fold a burrito,I gotta grab me a $7chicken burrito with two kinds of salsa,Chipotle is overpriced ,a half-serving of black beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just got a whole bowl of rice with almost no toppings,Who the hell wants to eat a pound of rice by itself,I can't believe I just paid $25 for this piece of shit bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always well prepared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Although I'm not sure how the bone got in my food regardless since I didnt get meat,I originally left a bad review because I found a bone in a veggie bowl ,After getting in touch with the store finally and calling corporate they compensated me with a free veggie bowl ,and also free chips ,I also discovered after speaking with corporate that the meat here is delivered boneless so that part was not on the staff necessarily,and guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Undercooked beans ,A Mexican restaurant that can't even get the beans cooked is pretty bad,and the meat had no flavor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but come on -- I'm ordering a veggie burrito bowl,They have stingy portions -- I hate having to ask for more rice ,and beans,but it always has a vinegar taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I asked for a veggie burrito," They passed my ""burrito"" to five different",and what I got was a plate with rice,beans ,and sour cream with a tortilla wrapped in foil h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is generally fresh,and to top it all off their food is organic,They serve the basic ingredients of a burrito,burritos,You can pretty much have these ingredients served up in any combination you want as tacos,rice,chicken,beans,salsa,and their meats are humanely raised,steak,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle sucks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fresher than anything I've ever gotten from other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a frozen yogurt shop near by and the best cooked food of the 3,but Portland is weak on taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My chicken bowl was very good,My brother's steak on his bowl was chewy & fatty, Nicely grilled chicken, tasty salsa,We'll be back but won't order steak, fresh ingredients, The other ingredients were good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was definitely not the usual,I was so disappointed that I didn't get the usual delicious food,the rice was over cook ,The beans also,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pretty much what you'd expect of chipotle,The ordering process is hasty and unpleasant (as is to be expected of chipotle),Moderate prices,One thing that did stand out at this location is that the guacamole (while overpriced) was exceptionally good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That food is what I've come to expect from Chipotle - always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Chipotle - the food is always fresh, I do have one gripe - the guacamole is $1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
trash is overflowing and the floor is dirty with food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the place was clean and roomy though and food tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great way to grab cheap drinks and reasonably priced fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For fast Mexican food you can't go wrong,and great quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 great food as healthy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have had nothing but bad food at this location,Out of rice at 11:15,today chips that were obviously left over from the previous day and a bowl that was cold,brown lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Step your game up chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this chipotle needs a serious wipeout of employees and to be educated on how to properly treat customers and how to properly cook the food,the food is still pretty good,I often visit other chipotle locations ,when I am out and about and it's crazy to see how much better chipotle's are,I never wanted to have to write a review about this chipotle,I cannot tell you the last time I didn't have burnt chicken, besides the burnt chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't have food readily available, and rather talk and congregate with one another then keep the line that's wrapping around the corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is my go to burrito joint,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You have to ask for extra everything just to get a normal burrito or bowl (,The rice was undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I find their ingredients to be very fresh,They are quick without skimping on quality or messing up your order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is excellent,high quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh chipotle,I will get chicken every now and then at chipotle (if i am not intending to get guacamole,bu the chicken at this location just did not settle with me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had ordered 3 bowls,I get there and see no customers inside so I'm pretty sure my bowls are made,I had to wait another 10-15 minutes for my bowls,They then run out of lettuce right when my bowls are being made,I realized they forgot to add guacamole to 2 of my bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can choose if you want to eat healthy on a salad or have a big fat burrito,chicken or tofu,  They have several types of salsas,And their tortilla chips have a hint of lime,  The meat is ethically sourced,They have guacamole, Amazing guacamole,with steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burrito,i usually change it up between tacos,i don't care what the news says about chipotle right now,nothing will stop me from chipotle,bowls,salads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
similar to food carts,Serves meat lovers and vegans alike I'm here to try out the Sofritas and get a free drink :) Nothing too memorable is food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Indulging in a burrito occasionally usually ends up with me having a soggy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Chipotle is infamous for their burritos (which are stuffed to capacity depending on what you like) ,and their burrito bowls (A bowl of rice in place of the tortilla wrap with all the ingredients you want on top), Now if they go to wrap your burrito ,brown instead of white rice,chicken (Other,mild salsa (Their Hot salsa is HOT,and sometimes guacamole (extra,charge for guacamole), options= steak or pork),sour cream,lettuce,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never had a problem with the food or the service I received here,Never had a problem with quality or consistency of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Simple and delicious food fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's considered a good day when we go in and don't have to beg for the amount of food we are paying an enormous,For a $7 bowl I shouldn't need to ask for the food to fill half the container,As for the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food , They don't hesitate to load up your burrito or bowl unlike other, I love the veggie burrito/bowl with chips ,and guacamole, Always recommend it for a delicious meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love mexican food , I know chipotle is known for its fresh, ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this place just recently got shut down for a couple days due to  a bunch of people getting sick from eating the food,I never got sick off of the food,I love chipotle,The rice has been good,I don't order beans,The main complaint I have is the chips,"it's a little salty"" I'm talking like the guy in the back popped the lid off the salt bucket and dumped the entire thing onto these chips",The meat (steak) has been rather chewy,but you'd think after getting shut down they'd be SUPER uptight about quality, and tasteless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I eat at chipotle all the time,but everyone always waits for chipotle,Sloppy skimpy bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The good thing is that the food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good, I ordered a steak burrito with rice,the price was reasonable,black beans,medium salsa,corn salsa, I also had a side order of their chips which were fresh,cheese ,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For about $9 I get a veggie bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I'm a big supporter of single or chain restaurants that serve food with REAL,When it comes to the taste of the food,but they turned me off years ago when they were exposed on the local news for serving a customer a burrito with menudo, Ain't nothing worse than cold ingredients in a burrito,One big thing that they don't do is let the sauces get room temperature or mix it in with the hot beans so it warms up some before the customer eats it, ingredients,so that's a tremendous task on their part to ensure quality ingredients are being sourced,so that's a tremendous task on their part to ensure quality are being sourced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I got there after running errands  I went to the register and sadly my food was not ready,He started making my burrito right away  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
) in my burrito,I LOVE chipotle ,I love chipotle,The meat is lower quality or something,The ingredients don't look very fresh,I used to love adding fajitas but now I usually avoid that and any other ingredient based on how old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The atmosphere depending on location can be a little loud and crowded but I still think the food's worth it, I tasted my first Chipotle burrito ,OR where I found any reason I could to take my roommates on the two hour drive to Portland for my burrito fix,I almost always order a chicken burrito, Their burrito weighs a few, I love the idea of making a burrito (or any other, Their salsas also run on the spicier, Their guacamole and chips are an awesome, Their meats are a little, This one being right around the corner from Lloyd Center also made the trip well worth it =), Yet the taste is light,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's delicious,it's delicious as always,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The favorite thing I love about Chipotle is their famous guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't let those skinny women stop you from going into the only Chipotle in a five mile radius that doesn't have a 45 minute wait to get your food at lunch,besides the judgmental stares of the Barre studio window as you make the walk of shame to get a huge burrito,I absolute love this chipotle location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
)  The onions were black and burnt and they put lettuce on ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They were running a promotion where if you purchase there one of their Sofritas burrito, The young lady behind the line took my order for my Sofritas bowl, Delicious bowl,I understand that Chipotle uses only organic ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every table was dirty and littered with food by previous,and an empty cup along with other assorted food items,The floor was littered with rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been through many Chipotle's and I do believe they gave a little less meat that usual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instead of anyone apologizing or offering to make me another bowl they all stood around and laughed while the guy who dropped my bowl cleaned the food off of his shoe,Then my boyfriends bowl was pushed to the side while they helped the next three people in line before even saying a word to me about remaking my food,We ended up walking out and as I'm writing this I'm enjoying my burger from FIVE GUYS and never going back to that chipotle,one of the employees dropped my bowl on the ground right before putting the lid on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've only had their chicken salad with just salsa however its very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Eat fast your food is getting cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get you're a new location but beans ,I can't even get chips in my bag half the time,and steak are not items that you can't flip flop ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My fiancé doesn't like eating the same food over ,Your incredibly efficient burrito-making/check-out process,Your quality ingredients ,Your delicious preparation of the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If it's slow they will always take time to talk to you and ask how's it going or how's the food,ask them for double wrap burrito so it doesn't rip on you,ask for extra anything besides meat ,and guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,The only thing that keeps me from giving my favorite fast-food joint,The prices are fair,and always tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are genuine with her questions and take real good care of you with your food,Love that the food is taken care of before it arrives here,The chips can be too salty at times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I'm downtown this is one of my go to food spots,Healthy food,I usually get the burritos,A steak burrito with a drink will cost you 10 or so bucks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this location is my least favorite Chipotle due to sometimes not up to snuff quality of food ,this is my #1 choice for quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Probably the worst chipotle I have ever been to,Bottom line go to fat head down the road or another chipotle locatio,guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the food was amazing,Great burrito size,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is always fresh,where I like the food (like Anna's Taqueria/Brookline), The only negative I can come up with is that some times they don't mix the food so well ,but what sets this Chipotle location above the other local burrito slingers for me is that the staff is always very cool, about throwing in more rice/beans/salsa/cheese,but I figure rice & beans are so cheap,the guys seem to take offense when I ask for more and spoon out like 5 more grains of rice with some attitude - which is why I've eaten at this Chipotle 70 times , I pay for extra meat,I've eaten here about once a week for the last year and 1/2 and the quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The manager and staff thought I was homeless when I was clearly eating with my fiends I just finished my food first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was decent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they really skimp on the meat here compared to other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Prob not worth the price tag ,made from the same ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything from the food line was in the sour,Overall it pretty much taste like chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and ordered my food,I left without my food,I called this chipotle location ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I always know what quality I'm going to get here ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keeping it will provide people something different than the standard chicken or steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also I asked for a little more chicken with my chicken burrito ,The chicken was served cold,Now I know why the chicken was cold, and the side of salsa I asked for was an additional,I complained that since I ordered chips that I should not be charged for one cup of salsa for 0,The manager Sean said he could see my point and gave me two sides with my chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not one to change things up so I get the same thing every time - barbacoa beef bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burritos,You can choose tacos,They have brown rice ,and white rice to choose from ,or a bowl,chicken,and pinto beans ,and black beans,several salsas,guacamole,cheese,sour cream etc,salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get a chicken burrito,The employees are very nice but most times I come to this location my burrito either unravels or rips,This chipotle has always been a little,lower in quality than the other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But I like the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 they make me a burrito with the rarest meat they could find ,out of all the hundreds of chipotle i've been to all over the country,The steak was so rare,after waiting 10 mins for them to make some better steak, I wish I would have taken a picture of the steak in their line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Free guac w/ my vegan diet burrito,All for a darn good price too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place is a disgrace to all the wonderful chipotles around the world,Ran out of chicken rice ,waited 25 minutes to get our bowls,and beans within minutes of us arriving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fastest and friendliest chipotle in Atlanta,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With Chipotle you really can't go wrong if you are at all a mexican food fan,Good variety with huge burritos,well portioned burrito bowls ,and tacos (hard,If they don't give you the portion you expect you can ask for more and they cheerfully spoon up some additional ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As far as ""fast"" food goes",it's hard to beat this fresh and simple take on Mexican food,Value is pretty good considering the quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food servings are generous,I got a fabulous burrito bowl,Their chicken is well-seasoned,but one thing not to repeat for next time is to get the IZZE black currant drink - tasted like cough syrup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is by far one of the worst experiences my wife and I have had at a chipotle in years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quality food,store but the line moves pretty fast and the food is always grea,this chipotle on campus is a high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and just about any other food aversion/allergy/life-choice,We had options to satisfy meat eaters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is why I choose Hass when it comes to getting a burrito,was out of all meats except steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nacho chips were yum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location seriously underdelivers the quantity of food I have come to expect from chipotle,so much so that I will drive further to get my burrito fix at a different,My usual order is a burrito bowl ,I don't want to pay the same amount and get practically half the burrito I could get at another location,I want to preface this review by saying that I am a dedicated chipotle regular,and have been to numerous chipotles in Colorado ,and I have felt that this location seriously skimped on rice,beans ,and meat (i,It seems to be the same quality ingredients as usual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a chicken bowl which was delicious,I also got chips ,and guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle and it even has the aroma of Amazing food in the air,Their food tastes amazing,Some of the food is not super,the food is delicious,There are a lot of options to choose from on the menu ( strongly suggest the 3 soft tacos with steak,rice,and shredded cheese),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bad rhiannon: but i want chipotle,smoky chicken,corn salsa,good rhiannon: they do get some of their meat from small,good rhiannon: all that sour cream ,good rhiannon: i should have a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Prices are good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get the burrito with brown,The staff is pleasant and easy to deal with - just makes my burrito fast , rice,chicken,mild salsa,I always get enough meat and salsa which is my favorite,and cheese,Other reviews complained about not having ingredients or small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I'm from Colorado where my love for chipotle burritos began, Some of the other reviews commented on the staffs ability to roll the burritos - which I agree its not done perfectly every time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would like them to include sliced avocados as an option for my burrito bowl though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and integrity in their food,Nice to see someone doing socially conscious food in a quick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you make smart decisions the food is good,but only once has the food actually been ready,for you (no arm sized burritos with sour,my dad loves the burritos,My son scarfs down a side of rice , The rest of my family enjoys the bowls, I've had both the barbacoa and chicken,I figure the chicken is healthier so I go with that more often,and beans every time,One of my favorite things here is the chips ,the chips are nice, They claim to use hormone free meats ,and guacamole, cream and cheese if you're trying to eat a balanced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got the burrito bowl with all the fixings,I stopped in at chipotle for a quick,I would go back to other chipotle locations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have by far the best food ,The service is awesome and they always spoils me with extra food ,I love the chipotle with extra, meat rise & vettables ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Next time I'll go 1 block over to Bell Street burrito,The worst customer service I've ever had at any chipotle,The cashier stopped bagging my order because a phone order came into to pick up and in the cashiers distraction she didn't bag my salad with the rest of my to go order ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst place to get chipotle,The bs I received from every worker at chipotle here was too much,First person I interacted with was a blond lady that asked for my rice,Especially my guacamole,I also wanted corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle normally has the best food on the planet,they don't seem to season the food here like they do at other,the rice normally has lime, They also tend to burn the chicken a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fresh ingredients and flavorfull salsas,high quality meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
today I ordered a chicken burrito ,but it might as well be a rice burrito,maybe a bit it chicken but the damn thing is 95% rice,Some bites I hit a bean or a little sour cream pocket,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the food is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While one cut up meat and the other person was running back and forth to get the food they were out of,I have been going to chipotle for years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food on the line didn't look anywhere near fresh,but the food quality needs work,The rices looked average,The chicken was a pale,The mild salsa was absolute,they stood there instead of cleaning up the messy salsa line,The meats in particular,the steak looked hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a fabulous addition to the bowl so it's always disappointing,Several times they have been out of chips,I've also been very disappointed by their salad dressing at this location as of late,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It depresses me to think that people in Austin think this is a good burrito in a city with a ton of good,burrito locations (ie, I even feel like Freebird's and Chuy's both make a better burrito ,but they are not in the class of the burrito establishments mentioned above,Now to the burritos, The pico de gallo and lettuce were fresh and the only highlights of the burrito ,Girlfriend generally orders the bowl and they sell barbacoa which is more of a beef roast and is nowhere near an accurate representation of actual barbacoa which is from the beef cheek and is a fattier meat than what Chipotle is advertising but the bowl was actually decent because it held the fresher ingredients from the burrito,All in all I guess this is what I should expect from a burrito chain that is owned by the McDonald's corporate, The cilantro lime rice had the flavor that it had been swimming in lime juice which completely over powered the rest of the fillings,umbrella but I should not have to lower my standards when you are charging full price for the product, The meat (steak) and beans (pinto) were dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the prices don't,I noticed my chips were extremely dark,I don't understand why the quality of service decreases ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If the food wasn't so good,I'm angry with this standing chipotle,The chipotle in Mt,I'm a student so I love chipotle ,I ordered 2 sides of guacamole for pickup with my meal,I feel the management is poor because they always run out of guacamole while other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
White millennials who don't know how wrap a burrito ,Well it's about what you can expect from a college area chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We had our school spirit night at Chipotle and enjoyed the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more authentic Mexican options around but I'm not from here and I just want to eat burrito the size of a small, This was my second chipotle experience ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Didn't have any steak ready when I asked for it so they comped my chicken burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or chicken because they were about to close,We could not get corn because they were about to close,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think the food is good, Now it's just an ok price,95 for chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
never had a problem with the food,Thank goodness they are serving brown rice now because the white,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pseudo Mexican food," Although I would imagine that most people here in Decatur will get a ""bowl""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very limited menu and the food is subpar at best,My wife loves it however and thinks it's delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  The brown rice was empty,they were scraping rice out of the pan, The mild salsa was empty, To top it off my chips were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
orders or quality of food,.rice was clumpy,ask agin for side of sour cream,",lettuce was DISGUSTING ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
.food is always cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which i often like with my chipotle anyway so that's a plus,but they skimp on meats ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 2 stars has nothing to do with the food,They heap on the rice,but when you want more chicken than the half,beans, My advice is use your favorite hot sauce or salsa if you need something to take its place,sour cream and cheese,"I quit getting sour cream and cheese all together since ""Just a little",Cars come flying around the corner while you inch up to it to see if there is possibly a spot to park in,if you are like me and get the salad for a low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love tex-mex food,and Chipotle definitely knows how to prep a very decent burrito for a very reasonable, price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wonderful person in the food industry,I think the perception of food industry jobs would be SO different,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  Anyway's I always get the burrito bowl with the Chicken rice,black beans, Makes for a great dip on chips,  Only problem i have with them is their chips,sour cream and cheese,too salty for my taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go to chipotle because I can get two meals out of a burrito bowl ,I always end up having to ask for more because they never fill up my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had their veggie bowl ,Their chips have a salty-lemon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is my favorite food, I like it better than all other burrito places Boston has to offer,Always delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is always good,I'm no stranger to any chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The girl who had made the mistake clearly did not want to re-make my food,My husband and I go to assorted locations often for their vegan sofritas burrito bowls,I normally love chipotle,) instructed the line to begin my new bowls ,when my order was wrong this evening and I was given chicken instead of tofu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only did the lady use her hands to grab my lettuce bowl I found a produce label in my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good quality food,Other locations I have to know who is cooking before I order and be sure I don't get a newbie burrito wrapper,If that makes me sound like a  burrito/bowl snob so be it,Nothing worse than an imbalanced bowl or a ill wrapped burrito to kill the chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Firstly the food isn't up to their normal,Everytime I visit this chipotle there is a problem, standards and other chipotles in the city,Thirdly this is the 3rd time I've ordered a salad from here ,there is no salad dressing,Basically they sold me a salad without the salad dressing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you can find one or take it with you and eat at your desk and smell like Mexican food for the rest of the day,com/#flash/order_food,The first time I was here I tried a burrito,www.chipotle,rice w/cilantro, The second time I had a chicken salad,black beans,corn and lettuce (for the 'healthy'),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 fresh food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We got there and obviously a couple of the staff members had just gotten off work and were ordering food,They were loading up their food to the brim,nearly putting the wrong ingredients in my meal multiple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only redeeming qualities are in the freshness of veggies (until they get covered in greasy meat) ,Chicken was VERY greasy and killed the rest of my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5 star for the most awesome and low cal and healthy and fresh salads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food at Chipotle Brookwood is the same,The restaurant uses food which is sustainably raised,Whether dining in or taking your food to go,Either the cilantro lime white rice or the brown,rice are good,My favorite thing to order is the chicken bowl ($6,25) or steak bowl ($6,Then I load the bowl with a ton of sides: fajita,I also get beans,usually opting for the black beans over the pinto,beans,corn salsa,and hot salsa,This means the meats are all-natural,cheese,I start it off as a salad to get some of that crisp romaine lettuce,shredded lettuce,All of the ingredients are fresh,you can see just about every ingredient get prepped ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But hot food lacking from what I expect to get from Chipotle,Burrito bowl had great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I unfortunately have to go here once a week to pick up food for my work ,but when I look inside the bowls there's the tiniest amount of food in it even though in the notes section I've asked for extra,My food is NEVER ready on time ,If I could I would never go back but unfortunately I'll be back here next week to get terrible service and barely any food for my workplace,By far the worst chipotle I've ever been to, rice,I'm ordering 4 or 5 bowls at a time ,and when I ask for more than one container of the salad dressing every time they roll their eyes ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got chips as well for the first,Imagine eating a hard dry block of over cooked meat with absolutely no taste at all,the steak I got was awful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their burritos are fresh,and have good ingredient balance compared to some other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They were recently willing to accommodate my request for a large side of white rice here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After moving the bowl to a plate at home I was amazed at how much food there was,I went for the vegetarian burrito ,25 for the burrito bowl,the way I've heard it works is an employee prepares a burrito bowl without rice ,"brown or white rice and a variety of salsas they can combine to create:
burritos","
burrito ""bowls"" (no tortilla",go for a burrito bowl with heavy,crispy shelled or soft tacos,plated in an oval shaped bowl),and noted as I orderd that I know the pinto beans have bacon (also noted on signs now) so the employee didn't have to use the line to remind me,pinto or black beans,and you pay for a side of chips,you know these have meat,have many combinations of meat,guacamole,cheese,sour cream, lettuce instead),one salad dressing,"
salad (only one dressing available",if you want any combination of their available ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food has always been fresh,I also cannot get enough of their corn salsa,and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is such a big burrito that it ends up being 2 whole,We always get the chicken quesorittos ,and they are so delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Example: soggy tasteless boring assembly plant food items assembled by sad,albeit non-gmo awesome food,"which I think is ""good food fast""",They are blazing a path to non-gmo foods ,To have the simple humility to honor and respect the food that we harvest,Fast food is so 1980's anyway that if you're still in the biz you're behind the times,I used to love their burritos,I'm speaking of chipotle,This chipotle is a skid,Maybe that's some other fast food empire that touts that tag line but this chipotle is not good,and humanely raised farmed meats in a huge,"Fast is just no good no matter how ""good"" your ingredients are",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
talk to the customers and make us feel sane while ordering our food,I openly admit that I am NOT a chipotle fan at all (I know,chips should be a standard and come with an over priced Tex Mex order- they should be free,They are so quick to just grab and pour that they covered my husbands bowl in sour,"the problem was the rest of my sentence was ""on the second bowl""--- my husb",I know) and he had double meat," cream when I had said ""sour cream""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The guy that made my food a had long,Now I have to find a new chipotle or wait until this guy quits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am a major chipotle fan,I will not return to the back bay chipotle location,I was getting my bowl ,and she looked at me with a dirty look and picked up 3 single strands of cheese and placed them on the bowl,and the girl put very little cheese on it so I asked for extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Something is not right with the rice at this location ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"always willing to give you ""extra rice"" ",The quality at this Chipotle is on par,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food is excellent but my goodness we need to defrost enough to enjoy the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well-made delicious burritos at most Chipotles,burritos are a sloppy,mess and they can't be bothered to keep the burrito inside the foil,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle it's saving money on the meet every time you order something they only put rice ,and beans and veggies not enough meet on the plate so we only paying for rice ,and beans that have to chang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food here is st,andard chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food always fresh,Considering everything is made fresh never frozen the price is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chicken bowl:  brown rice was hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The menu is simple and the food tastes like real,food - not fast food greasy, With food like this,Chipotle is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle's online servers were down on national avocado day and the staff here still hooked me up with my free chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
especially with the meat,They give you such a little amount of meat,My main gripe with this location is that they really do skimp on the ingredients, I knew it wasn't just me thinking that they were being stingy with the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality is consistent and the food is just very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is Beyond Compare , Thank you for providing wonderful service and superb food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible service literally gave me all the wrong food  I drove home & I thought I was going to have a good,meal and some how I got a bowl with ONLY  steak & rice & I paid for gauc so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If they get a decent sized online order while you're there and the take-out food prep station isn't up then you can expect a good,This chipotle location continues to disappoint time ,I'm a chipotle regular,this location has never been able to serve rice that isn't crunchy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Horrible for a chipotle,I would recommend to avoid and go to different chipotle if at all possible,They are CONSTANTLY out of basic ingredients like chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I typically go for a bowl with very little rice ,I believe that increases the flavor and the rice sometimes takes away,if you aren't into the cilantro/salt they put on their rice,you can always ask for plain rice instead,and lots of beans,veggies and salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Busy location and efficient staff but don't advertise free chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got the steak burrito ,I surely do not understand why there is an extra charge for chips and salsa,Both lacked any type of flavor and the steak was dry,and a cheese quesadilla,I'm not so sure why everyone loves it because it tastes like all the others,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a burrito bowl for ants,I'm a big chipotle fan so it hurts to give it two stars, Dude gave me attitude about another scoop of rice, They give you half a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yummy food ,and you get to order exactly what you want on your food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Highchairs with burrito debris,My chicken tacos were more like fajita,vegetable tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once we finally helped I ordered my grandmothers food than told the boy attending is also like a veggie, quesadilla while he started her tacos he told me okay I went down the line ,I've NEVER had a problem  with ANY chipotle,So whatever I remade the line trying to just be considerate and the girl who then made my quesadilla gave me an attitude and was rushing me to what I wanted (which she was just complaining and wanting to leave but the manager would not let her) and trust me I know chipotles,Sincerely a frequent chipotle custome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've had a lot of burritos here ,notwithstanding the occasional lukewarm/soggy/unmixed ingredient having burrito,I had a Chipotle burrito that changed my life,perfectly shaped burrito was incomparable,I wasn't even stoned when I ate this burrito - it really is that good,pinto beans,some of those little fajita veggies they had under the pinto beans,medium salsa,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Limited choices and $7 for a burrito that's low, You'll find me at the table closest to the free salsa bar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I love the steak burrito with lettuce,rice, No beans,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Giving this chipotle 3 stars since the staff seemed like they were having more fun than paying attention to the people waiting in line,Then I could enjoy their rice,I ordered a salad with chicken ,is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 One of the guys hands shake at the mere thought of serving you a decent amount or at this point a normal amount of your rice, I sit outside ready to eat and my meat is missing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
normally they give me enough in my burrito bowl for lunch & a lite after work snack,you can get guac added for FREE even if you get cheese too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they shouldn't be that low with food on the line at 7,the staff was short with me and I work at a job that is chipotle style ,I'm usually never one to care too much about service and I'll be very forgiving but this chipotle is the worst in central,last time I went though I had to wait for rice,I waited for them to make fresh Barbacoa since they were out but instead of bringing out a whole new bin they took a bowl to the back ,and came back 5 min later with it and it only had Barbacoa in it and they dumped it into my bowl,beans,they hardly put any cheese on it ,Barbacoa and corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went there today got a chicken bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When they made the burrito for my husb,One of the times that we came in I found a piece of bone on my chicken quesadilla,we ask her for extra cheese on the quesadilla ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The kids preparing the food spend too much,I love the Chipotle salad , They're always out of something and ingredients aren't replenished quickly causing you to have to step out of line ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I told them they would just have to throw my food away ,What's funny is that I ordered online at a neighboring location just after I left this one and they gave me my food without any issue,""" Why would I want a soggy burrito they've kept under a heat lamp for four hours",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I eat here 3-4 times a week mostly because I like the burrito bowl option,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I could make a gallon of guac for $6 and just put it on my burrito for ,95 for guacamole is ridiculous,Its also annoying to see them in their corner on their phone ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If I gave you a tour of my burrito it would go something like this: ""Now",you'll find a coop-full of slightly seasoned dry chicken bits,you can see coins of corn buried below that,in a particular order to even attempt jumpstarting my tastebuds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food tastes good,I'm sure it would say how happy it is that a burrito bowl is now only a 10 minute drive away, There's nothing worse than getting a burrito bowl with like, two pieces of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff are consistently efficient and friendly and the cooks are making sure the food is quality,I usually think the steak served in chipotle has too much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place was about to close when I arrived so no long line which was nice and I still had fresh rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but what's the point of ordering online to 'avoid the wait' when you still end up waiting an hour for your food,whenever I order online I feel like they give us less food,The bowls usually end up like 1/2 - 2/3 as full,Food is always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you know I love me some chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was unevenly cooked--there was a practically raw, But worst of all--as a former server--was the fact that I saw three different employees cross contaminate food on the line, I was horrified because that means anyone with food sensitivities who ate here could get sick, I couldn't even finish my burrito because of it,I absolutely love chipotle ,and red bits in my carnitas--and not really up to the standards of other chipotle locations,and then the third kept spilling lettuce and guacamole into the cheese, One spilled steak on the counter ,another one spilled the serving utensil from the steak into the carnitas ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is important to me knowing that they receive their meat on a regular,the meat had enough,and got an order of guacamole on the side,I ordered their salad with barbacoa ,it was far too tangy and sugary for me to put on my salad, juice and flavor to compensate the mediocrity that salad usually brings to the table,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I eat here 2-3 times a week and the food has always been fresh,quality management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I loved how quick and fresh the food was ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have friendly people that made my chicken burrito bowl exactly how I like it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So as this arguing was going on we got our food ,I mean come on guys as a manager I would've made sure that got up before anyone else was served any food, I'll never eat at this chipotle again their lack of management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your usual chipotle,Unfortunately it the closest chipotle to my home,they will most probably be dirty with rice ,And of course they were out of chicken ,and yesterday's guac and salsa stains,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like their burrito bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Chipotle as a brand and the food,But 3 times now in a row I have ordered online to be picked up and upon arriving my food is not ready,once I arrive the workers then RUSH and make my food,Initially I thought perhaps that this was done because I was paying in store upon pick up and they wanted to cut down on no shows and food waste ,don't expect your food to be ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
college student on a budget looking for Mexican food around campus,I'm too lazy to go find actual taquerias and don't really want to try the food carts so I settle for Chipotle's chicken burrito,It satisfies my taste buds so I'm happy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice is never done as it should be in this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am just not that impessed with the food,At this price you can go to  locally owned,buying the best ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is flavorful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I generally love Chipotle food so I was beyond ecstatic,My coworker and I ordered our food online ,We explained to her that we had ordered our food online ,the person who was supposed to make the bowls just takes his time to make the bowls so by now we have been waiting at the store for 10 minutes so all the people that came in ,We finally get our bowls ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bomb food,I had a burrito with brown,rice,chicken,pinto beans,hot salsa,cheese ,and sour cream,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Eat good food haha,I usually opt for the burrito bowl (saves 300 calories from their tortilla wrap) ,I am a huge fan of chipotle,despite the recent NYT article exposing that the average chipotle order has more than 1,If you havent been to chipotle,white rice,and get chicken,black beans,spicy salsa,fresh salsa, I love their chips , And their chips are awesome,I have recently come to be aware that the chips , The guacamole is fresh,corn and cheese,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Built our burritos to perfection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
's website to learn more about the horrors of industrial food production,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff is having a great time in the back while a customer is waiting for their food,I order a steak burrito with guacamole,the burrito was awful,meat was chewy ,the guacamole was dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a staff that always politely obliges the changing of gloves for their burrito bowls ,my secret to success: a veggie fajita burrito,this is the best chipotle location that i've been to,all at base price, that means beans +,and salads),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My son always want the crispy tacos with chicken,We like the bowls,The bowls are so big,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
walk a few blocks south to 9th and Multnomah and grab a delicious burrito from the Fuego food cart,The vegetarian burrito is mostly flavorless, rice,as they skimp on the other ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another chain but decent food,Not pricey ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's like every other chipotle,and I do love my chipotle,Location is prime - this is my go to chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reasonably priced food,You get quantity and quality here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 will be sure to chuck a bag at you at any given chance after charging you full price for rice ,and beans w/ hotsauce ,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent workers and excellent food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As I was telling them the food was frozen,and didn't stop or offer to do anything for anyone else who had just gotten to-go foods possibly with the corn,They didn't seem to care that they were serving frozen food in with the rest of the food,Their one job is to make sure they're preparing the food right ,and had to wait in the long line twice-- I would've at least liked to know that they weren't putting frozen food in other,ordered and paid for a burrito bowl with corn  (it includes some tiny,Weird experience-- I had spent nearly 17$ dollars to get my boyfriend a burrito ,Not to mention that I fully agree with the previous reviews about the inconsistent portions (my re-made burrito bowl was completely different,and my boyfriend's burrito looked just like the picture posted of the half-sized,one (and usually the burrito is just falling apart based on how it's been rolled),order another bowl without the corn,No one working the lines seemed to understand that I was having my bowl re-made/comped,they didn't test out the corn in my bowl,and myself a bowl,the chicken is often mostly burnt,It makes me worried about if they're cooking their meats thoroughly/consistently,and the corn/little,I went up and told them that the corn was frozen,they still let everyone pay for and buy the frozen corn/veggie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The burrito is okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
white rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your burrito may not come out like you're used to,I put an order for a chicken quesadilla and a burrito,that I was looking forward to see how she would mess up my burrito,and she put very little amounts into the burrito,This burrito was so skinny,deliberately ignored my request for extra cheese,She grabbed the extra cheese with such,I requested my ingredients, distaste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I generally get the steak bowl,an it is most certainly not because I try to stuff the entire bowl into my stomach in one sitting,I only give you 4 stars Chipotle because the steak was well done ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amazing guacamole ,and very fresh and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love this restaurant because the food is authentic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I LOVE chipotle so it pains me to hate ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really well priced for the quantity and quality of food you get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he asked me to pay 12 dollars for my one veggie burrito bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is alright,I had never been to a chipotle before,It's a chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was cold,I went in recently for tacos,I asked for a side of rice ,"she gave me attitude and said ""unless you want it in a bowl",""" I don't need a bowl full",but a salad dressing container is a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think its the sea salt they put on the chips and in the rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They were out of chipotle hot, They ran out of brown rice , Wouldn't you think to make more when this many people are asking about it while we are waiting on brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Step it up chipotle,no cilantro in the rice,black beans soiled in juice,Pinto beans dried out so bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Chipotle's delicious food ,as tasty as their food is,Sometimes my burrito bowl is to the brim,others (like today) there was a ton of rice,a tiny amount of beans ,and meat,somehow they forgot the cheese I requested (I must have looked away for a second,and commitment to quality ingredients,their iced teas always taste as if they've been sitting a long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered food online , The website provided a statement to go back to the store the food was purchased from,  The food was also not that good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Slowest chipotle in Columbus one person has checked out in 15 minutes I'm hungry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Torchy's Tacos all friendlier places with better food, In a town busting with great taco places you would think that they would at least try to be courteous, When my vegetarian daughter asked for a little more rice on her 3 item soft taco (white, Considering the price of rice and how much they charge for their three tiny tacos this is ridiculous, When she got home she discovered her tiny taco tortillas torn up so much,marginal tacos, rice,black beans,and guacamole) they said no, I tasted it ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Being an Arizona native and Mexican food fanatic,This is as close as I can get to Southwest Mexican food here in the Midwest,Trust me I've wasted lots of money trying to find good Mexican food restaurants in my area ,this is one of the few places I can go to and honestly get a chicken taco that actually taste like a chicken taco,The price is good, and the salsa is hot,Don't get me wrong I would rather have homemade tortillas and salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is very satly, Stick with the food carts ,I have tried to like this burrito joint, It's pretty sad when the rice overpowers the burrito itself, The prices are high too for a burrito,even the rice,I can see why the quality is so bad,I  get a bitter after taste in my mouth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the burritos are gigantic,Their guac is to die for and their grilled veggies are simply the best grilled veggies I've ever had at a burrito place,Chipotle is certainly where my heart lies and where I am willing to take the C train all the way out to Cleveland Circle to worship the fabulous burritos that they offer,The rice is easily replicated,I think it makes it totally delicious,but that doesn't make it any less delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like how they show you the food as they make it ,It's very fresh food ,I don't like how much they charge for chips & guac or the price of drinks ,Love their brand and quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not exaggerating when I say that nearly every single instruction I gave while trying to get a burrito made was ignored,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It wasn't the service it was the really bad food,This is the worst chipotle I've ever been to,The meat was so chewy,The lettuce was soggy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and basically not making food,I dropped by at 1pm last Monday for a burrito,I ask for a steak burrito,what about a barbacoa burrito,but his burritos weren't made yet either,Probably because the guy that was supposed to be making burritos was off singing happy,The cashier then made two separate trips to the burrito maker dude to ask him to make the burrito for the guy who ordered ahead,all the while a new line formed for people who had their burritoes ,The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars instead of 1 is because the chicken burrito was still your st,tasty chicken burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
while 3 people helped 1 woman to make one burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll still rate my experiences and the food I've had from here very highly,I was here last week and the vegetarian burrito I ordered really hit the spot,I was in and out of the store with my precious burrito in what I'm now guessing was under 3 minutes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've seen chipotles where the same person makes your burrito ,This time there was only one person making burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once we got to our destination I realize my child only had half his food ,We were at a sports event and I had to pay the same price as the whole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also have lost the ability to wrap a burrito that stays together,The beans were undercooked, and the chips were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Go to lake Mary chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food ,I got the chicken bowl with white rice ,and black beans,cheese ,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food is typical chipotle st,only the rice is bit overcooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hot salsa,Become a regular at your favorite Chipotle and they'll learn to stop asking if it's OK to add guacamole for an extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It didn't help that this one woman seemed to order enough food for an army ,This is probably my least favorite chipotle location in town,their salsa's are usually under seasoned (especially the corn),this visit their chips were stale,and insist on fresh chips (which I now wish I had also done),and the guacamole tasted like it was left over from yesterday or the avocados were going brown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's a ton of food,Two is just enough food for me to feel full,but could feed a small invading army for a year so I tried a burrito,My defining moment was combining the chicken with the corn tortillas for my favorite taco from this ,The chicken bowls are amazing,I didn't know the chicken was milder then the steak,I found the meat to be waaaay to spicy for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burrito was perfectly wrapped and the ingredients were fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tasty rice--white,cheese and beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I feel like a true VIP when I walk up to the cashier and walk out with my food in less than 5 min,I've done their Mobile Order more times than I'd care to admit over the past year and rarely run into issues with the food not being ready,I always ask for extra lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not all chipotles are the same,The portions are better than great and the freshness of their ingredients are beyond this world,Even my fancy pansy Miamian taste buds were pleased,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I work in the food industry ,does not mean refusing to make a person the food they came for,I came to get my chipotle bowl at 9:20 tonight,out of white rice,out of black beans ,and no salad vinaigrette,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been to this location several times usually good service good food,As I got up to order they ran out of chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got extra food besides just the bowl,a friend gave me a few free bowl/burrito coupons so I thought I'd give it another try,the cashier charged me full price,Even though I handed over the free bowl coupon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wasn't going to argue with the guy making my food because you never know what they are going to slip in there,To top off the fact the burrito they gave me was anorexic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This burrito joint is all right,the first time it was good and the most recent time it left bitter after taste in my mouth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They rang me up for the quesadilla and a burrito for some reason,When I said I didn't have the burrito,which would have been fine but the burrito leaked out a little,and I had drippings of someone else's burrito in my bag,This is not enough time to cook and every time the cheese wasn't melted,so they would instantly cut the line to get the cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you know the food,"Yes I said ""persons"" because you know how they slide your food down",I got ignored by the persons fixing my bowl,"especially when I said ""no cheese",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh,also like all chipotles,I've also been to other chipotles where the portions are a little more generous,especially on rice ,if I ask for more rice just please give me more,I've asked for more before and I get the edge of the spoon dipped in for just a smidge more rice,When I say more I'm hoping for at least another half to full spoon of rice,I want full bowls,and beans whi,ch are some of the cheapest ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is always on point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
His coworker lets him know that it'll tear if he tries to make a burrito with it ,He then poorly pours out everything from the last burrito onto the new,but half of the guacamole (which already costs a few dollars) and about a third of the other contents are in the old burrito,I lean in to ask if I can get a different burrito since he ruined mine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but then she redeemed yourself by having one of the prep workers make my food right then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I found the burritos left something to be desired,The burrito was HUGE (not necessarily a good,The first time I ordered the barbacoa tacos ,and I'll be back for the tacos,Plus there was a bad meat to rice ratio,It is a bit overpriced for my liking,the meat was flavorful,50 or whatever for a dollop of average guacamole,and it was nearly impossible to get a bite that mixed all the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
05 making my burrito a whopping,Love chipotle,If you want quick and good chipotle come this is your location,Little rice,Got the carnitas bowl with special,black beans,mild salsa,little cheese- - skipped the guac not worth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is cooked fairly well, Beware of the chips here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with healthier options being a nice break for those who do fastER food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" and we ordered the chicken bowl to split",but figured it was chicken skin or grizzle,I looked more closely at it and it was straight up RAW chicken,There was another guy waiting up there too and he informed me he found raw chicken in his Bowl too,I understand that sometimes meat isn't cooked all the way through,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The people that make your food are terrible,it has nothing to do with the food ,I love chipotle ,So I paid 10$ for a bowl of mostly rice ,and beans,they literally gave me half of the meat ,and guacamole I get at other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great tasting healthy food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also nixed getting black beans in my burrito (it was throwing the zen off),Now I get a burrito w/ brown,I do miss the days of $5 burritos ,Adding lime juice to the burrito was everything, rice (their brown rice really isn't any healthier than their white,I also got fed up with how crappy their chicken is (it's still crappy,and I no longer have to spit out nasty weird chicken pieces,pinto beans,They tend to be VERY heavy handed with the beans ,mild salsa,and meat,cheese ,sour cream,and lettuce,corn (this isn't spicy whatsoever),but by golly it tastes so much better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Want to experience over priced tex-mex food that is bl,There are countless food carts ,and hole in the wall Mexican joints that serve up much better burritos for a few,50 for guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,expecially when you perfect your fajita or burrito of choice,The Ugly: [1] Watch the guy who is making your burrito, and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Like I have said before I have been eating at Chipotle's for a few years and have always enjoyed their food, Lately though I have experienced quite an increase of oil in their chicken dices so I decided to test it out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today I ordered a Barbacoa and Steak bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dropping this place to 3 stars because they have made a deliberate decision to downsize their burritos ,and salad bowls,They also gave less chips per bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Where else can you get a quality (dare I say ""healthy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is obviously amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ordered a burrito ,Probably the worst chipotle i've ever been to ,and they wrapped it so poorly and didn't even care and everything was falling all out and i just always have a bad experience at this particular chipotle everyti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are some things that can't be ignored: torn tortillas in burritos,cold rice,Even when you ask for a simple guac and chips,the chips in the bag are chewy ,cold meat,and soggy lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got taco's,The soft taco tortillas were dried out ,I wanted chicken ,and the corn salsa was extremely spicy,but they had an 8 minute wait on that so I settled for steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The most emptiest bowl I have ever received from a chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Update : chicken,Other meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best burritos I've ever had in Boston,and the burrito bowl there is a must-try,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The NE Wiedler Chipolte Mexican Grill in Portland has great food at very reasonable,If you can wait you will get great food unfortunately I had to give up on the place,prices ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You want a burrito,You want a BIG burrito,You want the option of tacos,You want the option of a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This review is not about the food,you know about the food,she hands me my food ,Please venture somewhere else or please open another chipotle on rome-hilliard,Few moments later the cashier comes back to me and says we are out of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the serving of meat was microscopic,Ordered a salad with carnitas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anyway as for the food,Chipotle is Chipotle and its great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went to work and they gave me meatless tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,They staff here works extremely diligently to get your food out quickly,There are some crazy lines here but that's just because the food is so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is one of many,with the dtandard chipotle features,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and my daughter's food was free,I have been coming to this chipotle location for two months or more since I moved back to Ohio,I overheard the tall young man team member calling for backups for rice,I noticed the line was out of rice,I still was not able to get the rice or fajitas that I wanted for my chicken salad,I ordered a chicken quesadilla for my daughter,and the employee didn't even put chicken inside,cheese,and lettuce,corn,I was told that there was no vinaigrette for my salad,because I felt like even paying for my salad was a joke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with good/fresh food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There have been some great people serving that do not skimp on the meat,They are cooking them properly and giving enough meat ,and cheese now,They have made delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is still hit or miss with quantities of food based on who assembles your burrito,I still occasionally have to ask for an extra scoop of rice or beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Served me more beans than rice(I asked for double,brown rice),their chicken was burnt,I asked for a bit of sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was delicious,the prices reasonable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad service & bad food,My taco was so tasteless,slap on some cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but this isn't about their food,food all ready for me to consume,I was a little irate as I wanted my burrito bowl NOW,I received 2 additional burrito bowls,I am a fan of chipotle,Ordering through their app makes getting my chipotle soooo much easier,ordered chipotle through the app,the chipotle iphone app ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super convenient and my burrito bowls come out perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always have had fresh food here,but if they keep up with serving the kind of food they are known for I could care less,There is one lady here though that needs to learn what a serving of meat entails,but she only is in charge of meat rarely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UPDATE: went in today and employees were not using gloves when prepping food,This chipotle sucks,Saw an employee touching lettuce with her bare h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My wife got cold rice ,and no meat on her bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cons: The food,what would it matter if I can't eat the food,the chicken is always way spicier than other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food for a quick,and foods,a burrito,or a large taco,You can customize any order with several different options- into a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I satisfied my occasional burrito cravings at Moe's or Hot Heads, I got Sweetie her usual chicken/rice/mild/cheese burrito, The burrito was smaller than I remember,Yesterday was a fundraising day for the Columbus library- Chipotle donated half your purchase price to CML, I had steak with brown rice,a little pricey for the quality ,black beans,corn salsa,and some of their new queso with chips, The chips are thick,guacamole, The steak was seasoned , It is conveniently located near the southeast corner of Easton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always receive friendly service and awesome food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
partly because there's about half the meat,the salads seem about 25% smaller than a year ago,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like that it is naturally raised and well-spiced food,Carnitas burrito bowl with sour,guacamole,cheese,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She didnt even try to listen to what I was telling her that I wanted on the burritos that I was ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Barbacoa burrito w/,black beans,hot salsa,corn salsa,and cheese,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have not had food from here in years , Honestly like taco cabana a million times better, The chicken seemed rubbery , Very little lettuce and the beans were also dull,rather tasteless salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And if your super hungry get the tortilla in the side as well and get your gluten/carb fix and you'll feel nice and full just like a burrito,I used to go to chipotle in Las Vegas ,That is why chipotle is one of the best,white rice ,I enjoy the vegetarian bowls,I don't eat meat and this veggie bowl is awesome,Ask for both beans ,and extra lettuce,Always fresh ingredients,and supposedly they only use NON-GMO ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It's by no means a 5-star place compared to the Portland foodie, With its decent price point , What is it about their guacomole and lime chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My favorite meal is the burrito bowl or salad,bowl with chicken,lettuce and salsa,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service not up to chipotle st,When you are ordering there is no menu you can read which at other chipotle is hanging from ceiling behind staff,Had to wait for my salad because romaine was not ready,Put mild sauce in my salad before I chose anything then ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had the chicken burrito ,and my friend had the veg burrito ,But I didnt have a lot of chicken in mine,Other than that it was very good and very filling We also ordered the chips ,The chips were somewhat stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is amazing ,Once I got my food though,the food tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was delicious,taco or burrito or burrito bowl,I ordered the chicken burrito bowl ,choice of meats,and I love to add a side of their salad dressing because it gives it a little,Fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but have a hard time justifying almost $2/bag when they are free at other BYO burrito places,I typically stick with chicken,I also really like the chips,"I came into this location for the first time to try the Sofritas: a tofu-based ""meat"" option that had more of a kick than I expected",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The consistently of the food can be a little,other times the proportions are really small or the food tastes different,I luckily got a great tasting burrito,They run out of ingredients (white rice,chicken,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've always loved the Chipotle concept and taste of the food,and they sent me a free burrito to come back ,and they stuffed my burrito so big,I couldn't even eat half of the burrito before I threw it away because it was a complete,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice,no chicken ,beans,No lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then walk along the counter and tell them what you want in your burrito,but they will get you your burrito asap,The portions are pretty big and the prices are fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unfortunately this is the only chipotle close to me without having to go to mill run,I can only bring myself here when I'm really desperate for chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I got my food quickly, My burrito was sloppily wrapped ,and the taste was rather bland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the food offered at Chipotle ,and enjoy a burrito bowl at least once a week,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food has been fresh,I'm pregnant and had been thinking about that burrito bowl all evening while I was at work,they made fresh chicken and rice just for my order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was extremely salty,We like chipotle usually ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would not recommend Chipotle and would instead steer people to the food carts two blocks down (there are also numerous,food cart options on the PSU campus,burritos,Have tried the tacos,bowls,The chicken tends to be the best tasting,though the chips tend to be over salted,except for the chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Each time I place an online order I have to wait for them to throw my tacos together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a steak bowl and there was more fat and connective tissue in my food than there was meat,but I spent far too much money on this burrito bowl to be wasting half of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then the cashier took a phone call before packaging our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It really shows how important it is to keep your eye on your food,Tonight I went to pick up dinner to go at this chipotle location,I LOVE chipotle,I may take a break on chipotle for a bit,steak and rice ,I'm the person who orders a bowl with almost everything,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They didn't skimp on the chicken which is always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For food that is fast ,I always get the steak bowl with white rice,black beans,spicy salsa,a little sour cream & cheese,and lots of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food just doesn't hold up in quality to the other, The rice is often bl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
real food all things considered,not as a human being) - getting me food,The food is worth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While the food is always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Good food,and great food, I think the prices are right,In terms of taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes I get 1/3 more food than the next,the amount of food (despite the increase in price) is a lot less than it was before,I used to love Chipotle because it was fresh good food,The portions have gotten a lot smaller despite a recent price increase ,especially when prices go up with it,and the portions (for the bowl) are never the same,The meat quality has also gone downhill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle location staff don't even know to cook rice properly ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Faster than any other chipotle ever ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 You get a bit more food , If you order burrito, Make your own burrito,and no need to worry about getting a mini burrito one day, Hopefully everyone should know about chipotle, I recommend getting a bowl ,  Food is quite consistent on taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the chairs had guacamole on them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do not get rice or beans in my bowl to reduce carbs,If i am not getting rice ,no Keto bowls here,and beans - basically double, meat ,they would not give me enough cheese to create a adequate,"The worker said the GM said they cannot give more than ""fingertips"" of cheese",and sauce for $10 - Why can't i get some cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I returned the food I ordered ,One done a second bowl was made and when I started to eat I notice the the rice was dry, Ordered a steak bowl ,beans were at room temperature ,and the steak was  slightly warmer then the beans,and when I saw the remaining steak they had I ask if there was fresh,steak,since it appeared the steak was old,Her coworker scraped the steak out of the container,1 taste of this steak almost made me gag,and waited for new steak to be made,1 taste of this  almost made me gag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but then I discovered the greatness of their crunchy tacos which brought me back to this Chipotle addiction ,I can be in and out in roughly 4 to 5 minutes and they never skimp on the sour cream,That's a good quality in a busy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but you know it's real food,and its quality is the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They ended up comping the meal for the long wait and pile the bowl with guac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stars are for the food,Worst service I have ever experienced at chipotle,I never said black beans ,and they put beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have abandoned all of my favorite taco stands for their burritos,We both ordered burrito bowls,I honestly don't know how this happened when we were standing right in front of them as they made the bowls,I ordered chicken,and dropping into the meat while cleaning near those stations,He ordered steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was good,I was disappointed that our chips were stale,and there were only a few fresh chips mixed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but most of the food was cold,There were literally 5 people working in the food line,I've never seen so little rice in a burrito before,and the burrito was stale on the edges,48 for a burrito with chicken ,At this Chipotle I literally got two tablespoons of brown rice on my Burrito,Their chicken was good,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very nice people working and the food was hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was st,Unbelievably slow service especially for a chipotle,This chipotle can not h,andle long lines like other chipotles,andard chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But it's still just fast food burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but at this location food is no good,chicken was burned,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had the chicken burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My brother's burrito completely fell apart while he was eating it,I've been to at least 10 different chipotles ,and this is by far the worst chipotle of them all,The brown rice was uncooked,and it was impossible to pick out the brown rice,They ran out of steak during the lunch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Made an order online for two burritos,Not to mention the rice was not fully cooked so it was disgusting ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is always consistant,you get a lot of food for sooo cheap ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My chicken burrito had moist chicken,The only gripe I have about this Chipotle location is that the burrito makers don't seem to know how to tightly roll a burrito,tight burrito (that sounds a little,If they can put some effort into burrito construction,None of that rice at the top,well flavored beans ,and spicy salsa,sour cream at the bottom,There was a good proportion of ingredients ,my lunch/dinner was deliciously,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Especially love the burrito bowls,chicken ,and (pork) carnita meat is tender ,The steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anyways the food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went with the one that is essentially a burrito wrapped in a quesadilla, Then that is used as the outer layer for a normal burrito,tortilla and cheese- grilled,seemed like it would be a good combo with all that cheese, And it tasted great- that layer of melty cheese adds a certain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So with lack of my better judgment I decided to give it another go around and ordered tacos to go,I refuse to go back to this chipotle,I've had the chicken at other chipotle locations ,I refuse to go back to this chipotle anymore,I had asked the worker for fresh chicken after I told her I didn't want the cold,old chicken at the bottom as I saw her scraping around for it,Finally after wasting a few minutes she decided to give me fresh chicken,When I got home the chicken was loaded with salt,Just ran by a bunch of millennials who don't care about service or quality,and never tasted this much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they have been out of half of the food,they have fantastic service and the food is always fresh, Last night they were out of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their chips are amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for white rice,I got chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I found a long hair in my food,The manager said to save the burrito along with the hair for several,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its a food joint for the local,The food is the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is always low,and the food is never cooked right, My husband loves salty food , I do not want free food, I want to spend my money at Chipotle for yummy food not disappointing,food, Even McDonald's next door has better food quality than this Chipotle location, My rice is pretty much,the rice isn't even cooked thoroughly, The tortilla chips are so salty,and he cannot eat their chips because it is THAT salty, Even McDonald's next door has better  quality than this Chipotle location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually stick to carnitas or chicken,the chips ,and guacamole are a pretty decent snack (although I've encountered too salty and stale chips before), One time I got the steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sort of bland food in a clean,Fairly priced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they ran out of lettuce that day how does chipotle run out of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last night we went to get food,Sometimes they give us a lot of meat ,and other times it will be 3 pieces of steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I'm not sure what they do but the food even tastes better here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Glad Oviedo finally has a chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the food,I forgot my wallet at home and the manager was so nice he gave me my food for free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I think I've eaten at least 500 Chipotle burritos since I started going there in 2007,I eat burritos probably 10 times a week ,Always the same burrito,The quality of their ingredients far surpasses what most other burrito places use,but their burritos are absolutely one of the largest you can find anywhere in town,White rice,It's pricey,chicken,black beans,corn,and you can really taste it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But food just as good,Although there wasn't hair in our food I would say at least put it up in a bun if not a net,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As far as chipotle goes this one is not great,he just put some of the juice on my rice ,Then they were out of black beans,After I paid I was waiting for my cheese quesadilla to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like that they try to always use organic ingredients and that they use more naturally raised meat than any other food chain,America is known for its incredible feats of food consumption ,and they don't seem to be stingy with the food - although it would be better for most people's waist lines if they were,All I'm saying is that if you put away an entire Chipotle burrito for lunch,My burrito bowl had a reasonable,I usually eat half for lunch and the other half for dinner and half of my bowl keeps me full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They now have a brown rice option (with no extra,the best chips & guac anywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The foods is most always fresh,which involved bad guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I have considerable experience with their food,I'm a former chipotle cook,The chicken was bland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After the chicken became available I started ordering my burrito bowl,I normally love chipotle, All in all this was the worst experience I have ever had at a chipotle ,I asked for extra brown rice ,Upon arriving to the ordering station I was informed they were waiting on chicken,I thought no problem I can wait an extra 5 mins for chicken,then I received 5 pieces of chicken,"I said ""oh I don't get anymore chicken than that"" the worker replied ""one scoop is 4 oz ",received no corn salsa after I asked for it,and that's all you get unless you want to pay for double meat,and lots of sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I like to frequent this location for the proteinnzzzzz and brown rice, Brown rice for my fiber , I go for the half free range chicken ,sour cream and cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A 5in x 3in piece of saran wrap was found in my friends food,From hair in the food,to food poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why would that be a time available for pick up if it's not possible to get our food then,He waited for 40 minutes for our food,The last three times I have been to this chipotle during dinner rush hour they did not have chicken ready,I have been to this chipotle so many,The line kept piling up with people waiting for chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's something extremely satisfying about cuting a line of 15 people to retrieve your premade burrito,maybe both) with the awesome bicep tattoos who stepped away from the kitchen area to make my burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I haven't been to chipotle in years ,I ordered a chicken quesadilla,I ended up being given a children's quesadilla with no chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Mexican food ,but seem to be pickier about it than I am with other foods,but I think I'll give this one extra points for letting you see your burrito being built,I always love salsa bars too ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thus being said this location has been great the staff has been very friendly and the food has also been great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Think Taco Bell and think of REAL food compared to processed food,This is a place I take my soon to be 3yr old and we share a burrito together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Normal prices I would say for a burrito place,I had the steak burrito,I got a bag of chips also,And if you don't like your steak on the rare,side skip the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Noticeably hotter/shorter line than most chipotles ,and menu is just like every other chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
extra white rice,cheese,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle flavored hot sauce on top of your food, And you can't beat the food, You have your choice from a burrito,burrito bowl (served,WeatherMan Predicts: A burrito can be filling for even the hungriest of men or women,tacos (hard,Burrito bowl with chicken,black beans,mild salsa,and cheese,or salad, Then from here you choose your ingredients,delicious, Which might I add are just very delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle I would not recommend going to There Service Is bad and the food wasn't tasting how it usually does ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  They didn't have enough salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually get the steak burrito with brown, rice,I love the chips ,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however food is solid,and food line employees are friendly,and I order double-wrapped burritos regularly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food is the consistent quality you love about Chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also Chipotle decision makers--vegan cheese or sour,Non-gmo and organic ingredients often,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not much to say about the food,Like most chipotles, Overall it is a solid chipotle with a great,and use fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep up the good work and keep the chips salty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
especially when I get a burrito bowl  (which I did),They did give me a free bag of chips for my wait,Another free bag of chips for my trouble - cool,I love Chipotle's chips,but don't give me stale chips as a compensation,I'll do steak,I didn't mind switching to steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I come here the food is hot,brown rice,I always get the chicken,and black beans with cooked, and fresh and they also have some of the most delicious chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Almost zero meat in the tacos,And 1/3 of the toppings were scattered throughout the basket instead of on the tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As far as the food my rice was over cooked,and steak in my steak bowl was pretty dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but always go because I'm a college student who thought he could get a decent amount of food,This chipotle has always been the worst one I've ever been to,get 2 of the smallest scoops of steak I've ever seen then ask if that's really all I was Gonnu be getting ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Last time i visited i was a little annoyed that all of the empty tables seemed to have food , As always there is too much cilantro in the rice but they do have brown rice as an option now which is nice and you can make a special request to have no clinatro at all and it barely caused a delay in the burrito making process at all, Honestly I'm more of a fan of Qdoba because there are more sauce options but Chipotle claims to only get ingredients from local,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
every other food place in the back,They said they could make 20 individual orders of guac but refused to put it in one large bowl - (who wants guac in individuals cups at a corporate,It would've taken them 3 times as long to fill 20 individual containers instead of one large bowl,I called this location an hour and half ahead of time to place an order of guac and chips for 20 people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You know how some chipotle's are better than other,coming from a chipotle addict,mild salsa was a weird,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I said just give me the salsa I guess,went there a couple weeks ago my order was prepared correctly however upon check out I ordered Chips and Salsa however the worker said they had no chips available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can run downtown and get a burrito faster,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have never met a group of employees that are so collectively unable to make a damn burrito or bowl,What did it for me is the lady that wrapped my burrito today did not even attempt to wrap it,Mind you it was a regular sized burrito,This review is specifically for this chipotle location,not chipotle in general,because I LOVE me some chipotle,Just moved to Atlanta and this seems to be the only chipotle near me,So I had to eat it like a bowl which would've been fine, except the steak was dry,either their sour cream or guac was extremely cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They threw and smushed my food into a bowl,I wished I had of just walked out and left without the food,I should have trashed the food,"which meat"" when I was trying to tell them I also wanted the grilled green peppers (I could see the server was about to throw my bowl at the next",but I ate it (2 of us paid 20 dollars for 2 bowls) ,The place was filthy and servers were eating chips in the back as if they weren't working at all,"kept yelling at me ""which meat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HOT food,This is the chipotle champ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Chipotle location just got the vegan Sofritas option- shredded organic tofu (from Hodo Soy in SF) stewed in chipotle chilis,It's got great texture and flavor and isn't trying to be a fake meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love their hard tacos here,I usually get their steak tacos ,my crispy hard tacos,turn into soggy tacos ,They really drain out the mild salsa here so that the juices don't ruin your hard taco,Out of all the chipotle chains I've tried,At other chipotle chains,you can ask for cilantro free rice ,and perhaps medium/hot salsa to avoid it in the sauce too,I am also thankful that the servers here aren't sloppy with the salsa,and they cook their meat perfectly,sour cream,this one has by far the freshest ingredients ,I would say medium but still juicy and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A few stomachaches coming away from this place but I blame it on Mexican food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was given a bowl that was about 2/3 of what most chipotles give,Then I realized they had very little beans ,and meat left-,"The girl behind the counter told me up front that they did not have spicy corn - ""fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The rice was just finished cooking so it was yummy, I got the steak bowl ,Meat and lettuce was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the place also is often really messy with food ,Chipotle staff quality in the USA tends to be lacking thoroughly behind the counter: They're often way too slow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have had hair in my food on multiple,They will make me another bowl but with the same batch of food that had the hair in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So basically I ordered a chicken burrito with extra,I would rate one star but props to chipotle for making pre-eaten, guacamole and I think the chicken went bad,I tried to put some of the chicken pieces back into my anus to absorb any extra, chicken taste so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOPE wraps my burrito h,I told the cashier I ordered a veggie burrito ,So you expect me to pay for a veggie burrito with only,rice cheese ,and sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice with chunks of cilantro in it, I'm sitting here eating chewy but burnt chicken,and the shiniest/greasiest chips ever,He even asked for extra lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They serve good custom made tacos and burritos with fresh,ingredients in an industrial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank you chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and if you've been to Chipotle before they do have good food,if you haven't been to this Mexican food joint you should check it out,My go-to is the naked chicken burrito (or bowl),chips ,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will fill the gut in a pinch for a reasonable price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm reviewing on this particular location and not the restaurant chain in general (chipotle is the same wherever you go so I find it pointless to talk about the food),they seem to run out of various ingredients more often than they should,or are too slow in preparing fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nothing but wanna be fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they had no lettuce ,and told us it would be 10 minutes for lettuce,10 minutes to wash and chop lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the rice as well as the black, beans were severely undercooked,The steak,looked poor quality so I passed this time,I think they get too crowded and the quality goes way down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They make a great burrito for a good, price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food is food is food is food is food is food,You also gotta respect that Chipotle at least makes an effort to use only locally available produce and mostly grass-fed (entirely hormone-free) meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is often cold,I've given the same guy a chance to wrap my burrito properly over numerous,Love chipotle, The chips are wilted ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a veggie burrito on the app for my vegetarian,wife and it had steak in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but we wrote what we wanted down in detail in order to make preparing the food easier on the staff -- ,the food was outst,Talked the place up to my parents (who live two minutes away -- I'm back in the land of my birthplace visiting during the holidays) and they loved the food,When the order was started (three burritos,Note:  We could have rolled in and decided on the spot while they were making the burrito slowing everything down,We got two fajita burritos,My burrito,Outside of the skimpiest burrito I've ever seen a Chipotle make (because they decided to basically put no peppers on it) ,I would have asked for a manager on the spot to discuss the attitudes and some of their choices when making the burrito,three sets of tacos),and the insanely skimpy soft chicken tacos,You would've thought there was maybe one taco in the foil),but the mild salsa was far from mild,The items we got with the mild salsa were burning everyone's mouths unexpectedly (,(prob has half the meat ,and cheese than any order I've ever s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is my favorite,I ordered rice for my girl's daughter - ,"and when I said ""just rice"" the guy piled ","and piled it on - ""if it's just rice",and they load up my bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It consisted of tacos ,and a bowl,The bowl was barely half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I never received my food so there was no compensation or effort to rectify the problem,I was so excited to get a burrito from your 198 West,I respectfully thanked and requested Samir to mix sour cream with Vingerette and pour it in my burrito,When Samir had put lettuce in my bowl I asked for some more lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is st,I nearly gave up except that I ridiculously wanted a burrito with extra,I usually get a chicken burrito bowl with the tortilla on the side so I can still enjoy it later,I call for extras on those two toppings to make my burrito extra,"but get the ""bowl-sized"" portions--more bang for your buck", sour cream and corn salsa,And since cheese and sour cream are not extras and I find the meat just ever so slightly spicy sometimes,The Yelp App tells you to go around the corner from the boston public,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Enough about the food,I love this location because there are always multiple people behind the counter ready to help or replenish food,And I'm somewhat particular in I always take my order to go but with the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never been a big fan of burritos,I like the beef that they have and the spiciest salsa is actually spicy,I'm tired of other places where the salsa barely does anything to me,I try to get it from Chipotle because I really like the taste of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but never raps my burrito correctly ,and I always end up biting into a sea of rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went in for lunch and the counter where they prepare the food was covered with old,With the counter still wet with sanitizer she proceeded to drag the burrito through the wet,The burrito was placed on a sheet of foil ,sour cream cheese salsa from other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my go-to chicken burrito bowl,All hail chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now they have a staffing issue like the other locations--no education on how to make a burrito,Minimal chicken ,and crazy too much sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now all of my food is gross,Employee wouldn't change gloves between serves if he touches meat and then serving veggie bowls,Then goes and touches the cheese , and the same tray where they get cheese ,and lettuce,and lettuce is contaminated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tacos ,bowls,and awesome guacamole (that now costs $2 because avocados are apparently crazy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
.rice,chicken, She's on a specific diet and can only eat the pork for meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Chicken or Steak burrito bowl,beans,salsa,little bit of cheese ,sour cream, Lots of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Still can't live without this guac and the chicken or steak soft tacos,but every time I go to chipotle it seems like finding the corn tortillas is a process because no one knows where to find them,The chips are so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The portions are good and the food is amazing,I always get the steak burrito with mild, salsa/corn/cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was so much food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've had times when they've given me tons of food,The food always tastes great,especially the chicken and brown rice,fresh chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I opted for a burrito in a bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eat a chicken burrito,not the actual burrito/taco itself,eat a burrito,which I way better than most mystery meats that other taco trucks get away with,Why chipotle is better:,I've been to far too many places that have to rely on the salsa for taste,The chips are way too salty,The use great organic ingredients,and the taste proves it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and my food was great,I love chipotle ,Just came to this chipotle for the first,time and it was WAY better than any other chipotle in Atlanta,Best chipotle experience h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the burrito bowl didn't have queso on it,Also our chips were stale,and tasted off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They seem to cook the chicken just right here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now they have a staffing issue like the other locations--no education on how to make a burrito,Minimal chicken ,and crazy too much sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All the food was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been going here for years (since they opened their doors) and I don't think the menu has changed at all except for adding brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How could you NOT love chipotle,Normally when i've ordered the bowls they are a bit cheap, on the chicken ,AND heavy on the guac and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quality food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 He is not that big of a fan of this type of food, When the staff began to put my husbands burrito together it was massive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a burrito with guac,I asked her if she would mind to put 1/2 a scoop more on my burrito - she got a heaping spoonful ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very poor customer service and very disappointed about the food,Ordered a steak bowl ,and the majority of my steak was fat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consistently out of food during busy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I never knew e-coli is a persistent problem chipotle has,I had Food poisoning the 2nd day and I hate the e-coli chipotle gave me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
worse chipotle location I have ever bee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can taste the flavor and the care they take into making their food," The thing I think that seperates them from the other ""burrito"" places is the quality of their ingredients",I love the burrito bowls wi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ingredients are fresh,Way better than the quality at Needham/Newton Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A bowl here is half the size of any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food tastes good, I rarely have to wait to get my food, I waited about  30 seconds and she gave me my food,I enjoy their food , The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because even with the food being good,Chipotle is a good and fast solution for your mexican burrito fix,it's still fast food to me and I can get a really good burrito at some other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is one of my go-to chain burrito places,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 This location was very stingy on guacamole and chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My first time ordering from this location for delivery and the delivery person ate part of the food,I threw the food away ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Absolutely amazing food,The rice ,and the chicken is marinated perfectly,and black beans are to die for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wonder how dirty the food is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the portions were about half the size if my local chipotle,"Biggest factor on my low ""star"" review it the under cooked rice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Due to a minor lapse with food being ready,The food was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At a fast-food joint,You call this a burrito,Six bones for a bland and mediocre burrito (,and where the hell is the actual chipotle,At least they use free-range chickens,The only things this place has goin' for it are the corn salsa ,You call these tortilla chips,) and another four for chips ,You call this a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never had bad food or service at any,I'm always full when I'm done eating here or after I bring some to-go food home with me,it's cool and reassuring to watch your food being made in front of you at Chipotle,The burritos are large,(The vegetarian burrito is what I get every time,but I really enjoy watching my burrito being prepared from start to finish here,but just seeing the burrito being made is interesting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
) but it basically runs down to this:  Good food for a decent,I always get the vegetarian burrito with guac (it's free,"so that's all I can really comment on (I've never really understood the whole ""burrito bowl"" thing",95 for giant burrito ,price, While this isn't comparable to standard Mexican but more of the commercial tex-mex variety it's great for a huge amount of ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but this had never happened to me before with any Mexican food anywhere--even in Mexico--so I figured it was worth,My son and I each got the chicken taco kids meal,dry taco,His chicken was gristly ,The menu is so small and there's no salsa,How can you have a Mexican restaurant and no salsa,AND have the nerve to charge for chips,tomatillo sauce and corn relish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never had a bad time at Chipotle with the foods or the service,I like their burritos ,I've also ordered the three soft tacos which the last,These mini tacos could barely close,a touch of rice ,and the bowls are yummy,and beans plus sour,salsa , time were filled with steak,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but third time here (keep giving it a chance) and the chicken is poorly prepared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How can you screw up a burrito ,I stopped in around 6:00 to pick up a burrito,The burrito was all sour,we got to the chicken ,and and she literally put maybe 6 small pieces of chicken in,the chicken was empty,sour cream on with a bag of chips and salsa,and chips ,From there another gentleman took over there some corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hands down the worlds slowest chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They know how to wrap a burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even though you should be doing a better job of managing the food line ,service is good and fast and the food is great,I always order a Chicken bowl with small amount of brown rice,corn and lettuce,And the ingredients are fresh, and taste great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this location does not provide the same friendly customer service and authentic Mexican food aesthetic,and once I bit into it I realized that my burrito was a mix of food ranging from cold,but there was still a large portion of food served to us so it wasn't really a problem,Overall the meal was very decently priced for the amount of food we got ,There were good flavors in the food,food temperatures,~My burrito was a mix of different,so my room mate and I absolutely love chipotle, as some other chipotles around town,but that usually gets warmed up by the accompanying rice,I also encountered some burnt grains of rice,Which is actually ridiculous because the rice wasn't even warm,~My room mates salad bowl looked pretty fresh,but she said that there were a few soggy pieces of lettuce and that she bit into a piece of undercooked chicken,beans,which is understandable because sour cream and guacamole should be refrigerated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff is friendly and food is consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burritos ,Highly recommend if you like Mexican tacos,Priced slightly higher than fast food ,and salads,good quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their tortilla chips w/ salsa is also awesome- makes a pretty tasty snack if you're in the mood for Mexican food,I've never been dissapointed with a burrito from here before,Eat your awesome burrito ,Only downside- an extra dollar for guac and sour cream is a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The girl who prepared my tacos scraped the bottom of the carnita tray to place them upon a bed of rice ,and beans with a few,measly beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they were totally skimpy on my vegetable burrito bowl tonight, But then they skimp on my vegetable burrito bowl,it's not like rice,beans ,and salsa are high, They used to give you a lot more chips too,but chips,our order is usually at least $50 because they want double meat , I get that avocados and meat can be costly,and guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everybody loves burritos,The rice here is amazing,The addition of brown rice has been refreshing as well,They are doing a good job of using local vegetables and locally grown meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the strong smell coming from the cigar store next store made it almost impossible to stomach my food,The food area was also noticeably unkept,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was freaking WHITE RICE in my burrito,most tasteless excuse for Mexican that I've ever had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was great,we ordered a margarita but they forgot to make it so my partner was already almost finished with her food,I brought my family here since they've never tried chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and each time I get my food,or the taste you're looking for ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Enough food to fill you up ,I always get the burrito bowl with rice,chicken,black beans,sour cream and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,It's a straight forward ordering process and you can watch as the employees prepare your food,I usually go with the burrito or tacos with chicken,black beans,  Not a fan of paying for chips ,sour cream ,It's on a busy corner of Fairbanks ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go out of there way every time to make sure my food as is promised ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One star is for the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But I simply order a burrito ,Chipotle is a great burrito place ,I love chipotle and their burritos are yummy,and the staff is always busy at work preparing our burritos it's like a subway ,but burrito form,They have competitors but their prices are good and their burritos are yummy can't ask for anything more,Nothing bad to ever say about a trip to chipotle except ,I like at chipotle that they tell you their carnitas is not up to st,The prices may have gone up ,and chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One time the girl dropped half of the scoop on the counter and didn't fill it back up or put any additional chicken in my burrito,They give the SMALLEST portions of meat out of every chipotle I've ever gone to,I pay for a full scoop of chicken ,I got double meat one time ,I know Chipotles are starting to skimp the meat portions in general,I live right around the corner from this one ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was disappointed by their limp chips that were not crunchy,They forgot to put the salad dressing in the bag,not great for consistency or quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but for the life of me I don't get why this place more than any other fast-food-framed-as-accessible-Mexican-restaurant in the Lloyd-Broadway area,the Dormant Californian gets pissy when her tacos fill her with lots of meh among the meat,Maybe they like the prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food always tastes good,I like mine with brown rice steak,I always get a lil extra rice ,My husband and I always go here for a weekend dinner our bowls are always great, corn lettuce and sour cream,and corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is average, chipotle fare ,and is good for the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RIP chipotle,I think I counted 12 grains of rice in this bowl after I got home ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think I've found an exclusive replacement for my mexican food fix,I had a steak burrito, And the burrito stayed in tact while being taken out of the foil,The price is a very little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My bowl has brown rice,chicken,Black beans,corn and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is probably the only non-local food chain that doesn't disgust me,Best is to get a burrito with light, rice,And guac and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Sometimes the burritos are wrapped messily,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 All around I hate this chipotle , Not a bowl without rice, just beans , The beans, I said chips and salsa, And when the dressing/salsa was THROWN into my bag something broke open,almost forgot my chips,and corn and cheese, I got one little tong full of lettuce ,one would think that you would have the common sense that maybe someone who is taking their lunch somewhere doesn't want hot bean juice all over my cold lettuce just making it soggy,So lets start with last week when I grabbed a couple salads for my husb, So today when I ran in to grab a salad I made a mental,when someone orders a salad it should be just that, A salad,if I am getting a salad TO GO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can't go wrong with fresh healthy food,Lots of people come to this location so you know the food is fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food if you are in a bit of a rush,I used the leftover taco fillings for scrambled eggs in the morning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I believe the quality of the food was gone down significantly,This is very sad since it used to be such great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Here's my food right here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is in a great spot to grab a burrito ,The ingredients are the fresh chipotle st,"besides an ""FYI"" sign that notified us that certain meats did not meet some antibiotic",and they are generous with the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,The extra salsas and white rice are heavenly,The steak bowl is where it's at,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito was only half the size of other, chipoltle locations and my bag of chips literally only had 17,!chips in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I almost not paid and left but i did anyways cause family was with me and ended up leaving after we got our food went to skyline chili got wraps for everyone which still is bigger than size of burrito cause we knew we was gonna be hungry,Usually when i get a burrito they can barely wrap it without breaking ,Half a spoon of chicken 4 pieces of tomato which is because they didn't want to replenish it scraping the bottom of the tin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The person in front of me was taking an extended length of time to figure out what he wanted on his two bowls ,There was no one at the cashier so I passed the guy in front of me and went to the cash register and they asked that we get back in line behind the person who is still deciding what they wanted on their bowls ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and their burritos are really good,Chipotle has a decent burrito,Too bad the girl has no idea how to wrap a burrito so I'm left,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they charge extra for guacamole which is really annoying but the freshness of their food to me is worth the extra,I usually get the burrito bowl with carnitas,You can get a burrito,burrito bowl,chips,salad (with any toppings),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Came here to grab a burrito before an event-,a huge line formed and stayed consistent for the half hour it took me to eat that ginormous heavenly burrito,Delicious burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place tastes off sometimes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Love the food however we will NOT return to this location again,Re girl assembling our bowls, So what if my daughter wanted plain corn only,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,I wish chipotle had a carry out window ,I now know why chipotle has a cult following,Quality and price are awesome,I love how they don't charge for extra sour cream or sauce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$7 dollars for a huge veggie burrito (free,This place is also great for gluten free eaters (just get the bowls),guacamole with the veggie,This place is easy for vegans ( just get no cheese or sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I love that they offer brown rice,Their chips are the saltiest things in the world,I do not adore that they charge so much extra for guacamole,but man are they delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My daughter had the build your own box thing for kids and she loved the food,It's hard because I love love love chipotle ,But anyway I had a salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do feel like if you come during a big rush they skimp on the ingredients in your bowl ,Extra meat is an additional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i honestly love chipotle ,They barely put anything in my bowl ,and i asked for sour cream ,and i couldn't even see or taste it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then they make my food,I get my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great location just a few blocks right around the corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you won't be waiting very long to get through and to the delicious burrito you ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 You can actually see your food being made at Chipotle, I can go with the burrito,burrito bowl,soft tacos,hard tacos, I know everything apparently can be compared to chicken ,man this tastes like chicken,man this tastes like the chicken here,I actually saw the mild salsa (which sometimes has a kick for me) being prepared fresh, My favorite topping is the fresh corn salsa,but should we be eating steak saying, Should we be eating cheese ,real ingredients they use, Everything at Moe's tastes the same,everything tastes the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I am obsessed with their burritos,talked about our obsession over burritos,This is the only chipotle close to campus,We love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10 for guacamole they didn't even give me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but on top of the poor quality of the food,I ordered guacamole on my bowl (per usual) ,They are always missing ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I order a vegetarian bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bowls are light on rice,Even salsa is a half,Half a scoop of guacamole (for 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered chips ,The chips were so stale,and guacamole , I returned to our room and after opening the guacamole, The onions were the only thing we could taste or smell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The manager steps in and says "" we charge the price of a small kids burrito",Light on the cheese ,My wife asks heavy on the cheese please,The girl adds a pinch of cheese,how much do you charge for a pinch of cheese,The managers said corporate says we are loosing money on cheese ,They had a trainer come here to show us how to serve the cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came and to have lunch this afternoon and watched in line as one of the employees used his gloved hands to scrape food off the counter into a trash can,he proceeded to handle food for the next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was delicious,probably because she was calling out requests for refills on ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food just sucks,"I'm not across the board against ""white"" Mexican food",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No chips,no guacamole,no corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are quite a few reviews here that mention food poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff is always amazing and the food is great,It's negligent for chipotle to continue to let this firm do security for them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I called to complain and the manager offered free food,"""I can afford Chipotle's food",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep it delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only one star because zero is not an option and at the end of the day the food tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food somehow is not as consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Out of all the MANY Chipotles I've been to over the years I've never seen them scimp out on the rice,dry steak,Stingy with steak too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their food is always good,As the servers empty the food containers,Really appetizing backdrop as I'm ordering my food,Not a good scene especially after their recent food scares,2 stars because the burrito was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and they were skimpy on the black beans,they are also polite if you ask for a little more black beans or guacamole,but tend to put meager portions of black beans,they will give customers huge portions of meat,and guacamole, When I asked for more guacamole, I only received more guacamole ,and guacamole in orders,cheese,and sour cream, I order a vegetarian salad, That's 4 out of the 5 ingredients in my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The tofu burrito with guac is the way to go,Even if you aren't into meat you have to give the tofu burrito a try you won't regret it,Great taste and the price isn't bad,And you won't even notice that you aren't eating meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ate a free burrito,It would be very good if it was all completely soaked in tasty salsa,the barbacoa meat was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the worst chipotle of all time,I may actually never visit a chipotle ever again because of how filthy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,You shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes for a burrito bow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh,This is a very well run chipotle,This is my chipotle of choice,If you like chipotle then you definitely need to check out this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went here for dinner tonight because I got one of those free burrito coupons in the mail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great food tonight ,and enjoyed the free guacamole and chips for registering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was just as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To top it off the food was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It's always a clean and filling burrito, Definitely the burrito of choice for soccer moms ,It would be higher on my list of burrito choices if it wasn't so damned, I mean $11 bucks for a burrito,They do have the best chips in town and the hot salsa is actually pretty,but it's more of a sauce than a salsa to me,chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love to add the fajita veggies for a little extra food ,The food is good,I am a big fan of the bowls,that and the outrageously expensive charge for guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but then grew very passionate about quality foods ,Look at it this way: rice is the landing pad of all the rest of your burrito or bowl,if you want a bit of a lighter bowl or burrito,*A Chipotle secret: Order extra rice,"just ask for ""only a little bit of rice",The fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would give them a better rating if they stopped pretending to be Mexican food , Truth be told I actually like the food quite a bit , Chipotle is truly a souless fast food place that assembles your food instead of cooking it,and eat at a Chipotle when I am in a hurry or am feeling something a little on the healthier side (I usually get the veggie burrito),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a chicken bowl ,because I like using the chicken bowl like a dip for my tortilla chips,and tortilla chips,and because one person in my party had to wait a minute for them to bring out a new guacamole container,They were generous as far as amount of ingredients,and they didn't sacrifice quality for speed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
large food portion,and for the price per volume you'd pay fifteen,healthy ingredients ,and plain delicious fare,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As good as this food is this is NOT the first,What is the point on paying close to 23 dollars for two burrito bowls ,We get chipotle ALL THE TIME like a lot of people do,However this review is for my experience I just had at the Westwood chipotle, time i have experienced shitty service at a chipotle & someone needs to start training proper,they we're almost out of white rice,Not to mention when I said guac for one of my bowls she said as you can see we are out of it & it's going to be a REALLY REALLY long,chips or anything I was just told a total that i needed to pay,completely out of cheese & completely out of guacamole,maybe since it's mid dinner rush when you get down to half of your guac pan you should call the prep guy in the back & let him know to start whipping up some guacamole seeing as it's supposed to be your most delicious, item & same goes for the cheese ,and the corn,when 1/3 of the ingredients they don't have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Whether it's the chicken or steak,All the meats should be mildly seasoned with heat added to taste using the different types of salsas or sauces,I cannot eat more than a couple of bites before the heat from the spices used on the meat are too overpowering,neither of these meats were this spicy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The grill was covered with black burnt chicken ,and vegetables that the cook didn't bother to clean off before adding raw chicken to the mix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the food here,Prices reasonable for the taste ,and quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was terrible, We got the bowl,and they barely gave us any chicken, Our guacamole was brown ,and tasted like they used rotten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was great,Went in with a friend once and he wanted steak but they were waiting on the new batch to finish cooking so the guy helping him like threw his burrito to the side ,The chips were a little,heavy on the salt but it was a few chips here ,and let out a huge sigh like it was a big deal that he had to wait 1 minutes for the steak,I mean it tasted like good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice was old and crunchy so I ended up throwing away my burrito ,The guacamole is like $2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but most Chipotle's you go to employ Mexicans and latino people know how to make a fajita burrito,rich kids from Powell with evening jobs do not know how to make a proper fajita burrito," Steak is almost always chewy from this location and overdone and none of them can fold a burrito very well  This location definitely wins ""White-est",nor can they cook the ingredients properly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was mediocre at best,but it was still a long wait for food that wasn't very good,The line was long and the restaurant ran out of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had to go drive around another ten minutes while they made our food, By the time I got the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Impressive that the dude cooking the chicken sticks a thermometer in each piece to determine if it's cooked enough or not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and thus began a serious burrito relationship that lasted 4 years,25 for a burrito the size of a rolled-up,only so that I could make myself burritos,it was always the same: chicken fajita burrito, I could never finish a whole burrito,my stock burrito has all 3 salsas on it,I can honestly say that I've never had a superior burrito, I haven't tried everything on the menu (no taco salad for me),light rice,no beans,extra fresh tomato salsa,sometimes chips ,and guacamole on the side, I have since also tried the steak,cheese,extra sour cream,lettuce,which was situated in a cornfield in rural, Made with organic and free-range ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I was surprised and dismayed that there was so little quality Mexican food in Chestnut Hill ,it's exactly the kind of food I was looking for,I'm a big fan of the chicken burrito bol,and I try to get chips and salsa only ,If I weren't trying to shed a few pounds now (probably from too many of the aforementioned chips),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always tasty,Sometimes my burrito is as big,as my fist and sometimes it is what a Chipotle burrito should look like for $7+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm ok driving to Perimeter or Mill Run to get my food,have fun waiting as there is NO incentive to get the next batch of hot food to the line before it runs out,"""if you are getting brown rice",White rice - stay back there,guacamole,Does Chipotle run out of cheese,and lettuce on the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their guacamole is amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Frontline staff AR happy to serve customers and entertain request for extra helping Zone rice beans ,and salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Portions were smaller than most chipotles we frequent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I like a little more selection for my burritos / tacos,"I though the best part of the experience was the ""chipotle"" smoked tabasco sauce - I guess that's a positive",but I was happy with the quality of the meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito was full,I love chipotle, of yummy white rice,salsa,steak,and cheese,sour cream,lettuce,It's simple but super delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is fresh,  I definitely love their burrito bowl,half rice,just keep in mind if you don't like st least miled spice the chicken can have a bit of a bite,double meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 One day you get a reasonable portion and other days the servers remove food they have already put in your bowl,We ordered online today and when we opened our containers at home two of us had just half a bowl of food,it seems to be more consistent at least with the food quality,Food quality here is very inconsistent, Some staff are great but the majority seem to lack the training and supervision consistent with the quality you expect at this level of restaurant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12 hours later (the usual time it takes for food poisoning),This absolutely was THE cause of his food poisoning,Yesterday my partner & I went cuz it's hard to deny that Chipotle's burritos are tasty,quick and a pretty good amount of burrito for the price,brown rice,black beans ,and green salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I adore their rice here ,Burrito bowl FTW (For The Win), The corn and mild salsa,go with another meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I stood in the slowly moving line today and witnessed an employee scream and get nasty with a customer who asked if her burrito could be cut in half,I am a huge chipotle fan,the staff at this chipotle are terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I haven't gone to many food carts (,and the burritos are large,Its a MASSIVE burrito,any day is a chipotle day),and I should) but these are really tasty for reasonable price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place used to be fresh and clean with great taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A burrito place with an out of order soda machine,the burrito itself was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The good news is that the food is relatively consistent,I love chipotle ,The bad thing is they are always out of stuff like chips ,"It was 715 and they didn't plan to make any more chips or dressing bc that was the ""morning crews job"" ",and salad dressing the last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a chicken burrito ,My whole burrito was cold,Then I wanted a new burrito the manager gave me attitude ,and got sour cream,the sour cream was sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That issue is exacerbated by the fact that the servers job who's only job is to roll burritos- can't roll a burrito,Lastly I like lime juice but the whole burrito was sour,Too much liquid accompanied by the beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place is a joke and I will never eat here again the line makes you feel like you're in a cattle call and the food is mediocre at bes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the line is always so long and for what bland american/mexican style food,First of all when I orderded my tacos I noticed that they only put maybe 10 little,pinto beans evened out separately on three tacos,so maybe less than 4 beans on each taco,Everytime it never fails my taco falls apart in my h,"It makes me miss the good old ""make your own taco day "" in college those were even better",some spice and more beans ,but still I never taste ethier chipotloe season or any heat in there meats,Adding more ingredients so it,I still feel they should add more ingredients or step it up with the way they approach your order,t taste like cardboard which isn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am used to chipotle being inconsistent,even though I requested extra rice,Hardly any rice just SO,but I've never had them but such a little amount of rice in a bowl before,I think I'd rather be in store to supervise what they put (or don't put) in my bowl,it was almost totally sour cream and guacamole,but it tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a chicken burrito ,You could tell the chicken didn't have a ton of salt ,I usually go to a Vietnamese place on the corner ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The manager was thinking it was a quesaritto (2 layers of tortilla with cheese in the middle then wrapped as a burrito),and rolled as a burrito,And they ripped my husbands burrito ,We have chipotle maybe once a year,I don't understand how literally every chipotle I've visited,I think we're done with chipotle for good,They made a cheese quesadilla,So we were charged an additional $7 for basically warming up the cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good tasting food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can come here by myself for lunch since the hubs isn't much of a fan (spoiled by real Mexican food in California,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle but come on inwait in a 15 minute line donget bad food not goo,Undercooked rice,And salty rice is a no no for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
faster service and reliable hours plus the food's damn good,As an avid chipotle lover,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the second time I've gone to this Chipotle establishment and have had my burrito smeared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I barely have any brown rice in my bowl,The bowl seemed soaked,God forbid you ask for fresh tortilla chips,Chicken was cold & barely any cheese,She got a salad,"So much for a ""hooked"" up salad",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At least the food was really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poor food preparation - from what I've observed after a few,"I was actually told that my food selection ""will not taste as good",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only business I know that increases their prices ,We have come here consistently and received chips that were soggy,If the bigger guy that has tattoos is taking your order you might as well bring your own meat in the building,I asked for extra cheese today , The lettuce pieces I could count on two h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gone are the days of excessive rice,with chips it becomes the perfect,It should go without saying that Chipotle has the best guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are CONSTANTLY out of chips,I've probably lost close to $20 on chips I've ordered that weren't given because they didn't have any,The few times I have been given chips,hard avocado in the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,rice ,salad with black beans,There was one time when their registers were on the blink and they gave me the salsa free,they gave me two free cards - one for chips ,and guacamole ,and tofu which is delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
although when it's busy they seem to rush through orders and burritos seem a tad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I calculated what I ordered and according to my food calculator: 1110 calories,Chipotle keeps their standard of providing great food ,my burrito bowl was $6, This time I ordered about half the amount of brown rice with beans ,and chicken with all the toppings,As always the chicken was well seasoned,My usual favorite is their topping with corn in it and the guacamole,99 with everything but they charge extra for the guacamole, I enjoy the freshness of the ingredients with all the additional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice was over cooked,The whole bowl was awful,The guacamole was tasteless,The steak was dry, and tasteless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great for inexpensive and quick burrito,Basic chipotle atmosphere with a nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Guacamole is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mom shows up to pick up the food ,one of the female workers come chasing after her and snatches the chip bag from our food bag claiming that those weren't supposed to be hers,Very simple 2 burrito bowls ,and a salad bowl,the completely make the salad bowl wrong,she figures it was their way of apologizing for the delayed order and wrong bowl,they add a bag of chips in our bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It has to do with the food,Now I've worked food service,But I think most customers would agree that waiting a couple of minutes for top quality food is worth it,It's a shame they can't be consistent with their food during rushes,I hope the managers can figure out how to manage the food quality during a rush in the future,The rice,Which sucks because I love me some Chipotle- I have a Pavlovian response whenever someone mentions a veggie bowl so I've been to several,"Today's veggie bowl had ""sauteed"" veggies that were basically raw",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my burrito bowl was made half of the portion size , I have never felt so flustered ordering burritos in my life,when I paid full price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the kid who made my burrito bowl put 7 beans in the bowl and when I requested more asked if I wanted double and then globbed an atrocious amount of sour cream on my food,and the chips were beyond stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steak burrito bowls all day every day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Food is great except the chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Food quality was st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice was very moist,I've been to locations where the bowl is so stacked up with ingredients that ,The guacamole did not look fresh,the lettuce falls off the sides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grabbed a quick burrito on my way to a meeting today,I'm assuming the cold was the salsa - which is probably a good, idea to keep cold - but the other ingredients should have been hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Started coming here after hearing about their healthier food/organic,I have had consistently good food on both recent,Nice to see the manager on the food line,Our meals were cooked perfectly and I look forward to making a return trip for another standout Carnitas burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is tasty, I try to eat just half a burrito - also definitely a wise idea, They have a burrito bowl - without the tortilla, I love that they have natural pork and chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is ok, Prices are high, Unfortunately I had gotten my sofrito bowl to-go or I would've complained to the manager about the small,portions are small and if you order a bag of chips for like $1, I think I counted about 25 chips, If you sell a bag of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ingredients here are just as fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consistent with other chipotle locations in terms of food quality,Love Chipotle's guac and I always used to get burritos until I tried to soft,tacos,and chicken-all were good,Normally I get my guac on the side and order chips with it,steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I hadn't eaten all day and threw down $10 for some food got half way through the burrito to find a transparent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have always ordered 2 soft shell tacos at chipotle,So they took a dirty container and put my tacos in it,They had to remake my tacos ,They filled the taco with sour,Worst chipotle I've ever seen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have never had an issue with chipotle until I visited this location,When I got home the cheese was so burnt,There was lettuce and cheese all over the counter by the cash register,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(I'm guessing it would have been six of six had the sixth individual actually served any food,There were six people pushing my burrito bowl along (perhaps that's why I couldn't park in the parking lot,") Twice I asked for ""just a little more"" veggies or black beans (two different",and Chipotle explained that they have no problem giving you more of any ingredient when you ask (except meat ,By the time I got to the cheese,The woman working the cheese station seriously grabbed about a quarter of what I'm used to seeing at other,only to get an eye roll and a blatantly obvious attempt to give as little of the said ingredient as possible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food,How are you supposed to make food right if you can't even hear the freaking order,the rice under-cooked,The chips were staler than a Chuck Norris joke, and my usually delicious guacamole tasted sour,is fresh and full of delicious flavor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been to a lot of chipotles ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the burrito or burrito bowl,The best meat is the barbacoa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the burritos here,I think it's the lime-cilantro rice that makes it unique,and the fresh grilled meats put it over the top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I grabbed a bag in an effort to beat the 5 second rule by bagging my own food,full on grabbing the dust pan and everything) and reached for my food to bag it for me,he just left my burrito there to wait, So my burrito ,but seemed annoyed when I asked her to mix my burrito innards up,so she half folded my burrito (don't they have burrito folding degrees here,then didn't even completely wrap my burrito with the foil ,but I'm giving it 3 stars because I did maul that burrito ,because most people want a full on globby bite of guacamole,and guacamole,so I feel like the cooks in the back deserve 3 stars for taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was cold,there was a hair in my food, and the grilled onions tasted like spoiled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered 2 burrito bowls ,I will never eat at this chipotle again,A friend of mine found a ladybug in her lettuce ,"went back to the store and was told ""we don't wash our lettuce""",They are very stingy with all ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is consistently good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love chipotle,Another time I came in they had no rice,*employee scoops chicken,"Me: ""uhh can I get more chicken","Employee: ""double chicken is extra",chicken,the meat is cooked really well,"Employee: ""What kind of meat",guac or lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This may be the busiest chipotle I have ever seen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the food here is pretty good,I love the burritos with steak ,and white rice ,and black beans,so delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love that I can put ALL of the meats and all of the veggies into one big burrito,I love love love chipotle,We all are so blessed to have a chipotle,I love that they have alkinds of meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The place always does a great job of loading my burrito with everything I want , My burrito is always well stocked with meat ,and beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and delicious burritos,tacos,salads,national chain but usually very consistent with high quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just a little sour cream or guacamole always equals a full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The guy that serves during lunch can make 400 (plus or minus some) burritos a minute so you are in ,They never run out of chicken or rice (other,I suppose I'd take a little more meat (I think Qdoba does slightly more),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome food, I've always had consistent good food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got my normal chicken burrito ,50 for a chicken burrito) ,TLDR: it's chipotle,decently well run chipotle,It's chipotle,Prices are reasonable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the food as always, There was a guy cooking meat right behind the counter ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had gotten off work at 9:20 and actually was excited because I was off in time to get some decent food,I then took my food ,This is just sad because between 9 and 10 there are so many people that are able to get out of work in time to make it over to chipotle to get some good food ,As im standing at the cash register as he's wrapping my burrito,"As I start to walk away the guy that folded my burrito said "" Sorry again about that "" ( referring to not having the rice) ",I was hungry and had a long day at work and wanted my chipotle the way I like it if possible,That really frustrated me because I work right down the road and I'm not going to drive all the way over to sawmill to get my dinner if I can make it in to the chipotle right down the road from me almost a half,I find out they've been out of white rice for a while ,I do not like brown rice at all,So I asked how long it would take until they had more white rice,So I wait a few minutes and more people come in and ask for white rice ,About 10 minutes go by and a guy walks up to me and asks me what I'm waiting for and I said I was waiting for the white rice,He then told me there was a complication with the rice cooker ,and that the rice wasn't cooked ,I was very upset because I knew they didn't have any intention of making any more white rice the rest of the night or else they would have had more almost finished ,when the white rice ran out,I guess they just expected everyone to be okay with brown rice,The guy then told me that if I got the brown rice that he would comp my meal,So of course being hungry and waiting for 10 minutes for no white rice,I accepted the offer and got the brown rice,I would have much rather paid the full price ,and just had the white rice as would everyone else that walked out,I would tell them that there's nooo rice at all ,I came in almost a half hour before they closed intended to get white rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got food poisoning here ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and brown rice are the bes,Steak bowls with pico,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Though I love the tacos I've been getting the veggie burrito more often,I really love the hot salsa (red,The staff here is super nice and I often get extra cheese ( at least I think it's extra,They never skimp on the ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because we've taken him to at least 5 chipotle patios with us before ,so I could save my bowl for later,I asked for guacamole on the side,yet it was scooped on top of my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have never run out of chips either (Fenway ALWAYS runs out of chips),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  I like that you can customize your meal to your taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I work down the block from here and my staff and I were excited for the opening bcz we all love the food,But we have all experienced their mediocre service and terribly prepared food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chewy stale chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I went there last week and ended up with the worst food poisoning - E,I usually love chipotle,I'm sad because I used to love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last night they were out of steak bc it had been burned ,I have NEVER heard of steak taking a whole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food ,They make the burritos fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered chicken tacos to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Same great quality,same awesome taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good burritos,Guacamole on our burrito is $1,A bit pricey though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anyways it kinda reminds me of subway meets taco bell but they serve burritos that are literally like the size of your face,or chicken to choose from and if burritos or tacos arn't your thing you can always get a bowl,and sadly enough we don't have a chipotle where I live,I mean chipotle is soo,I love chipotle ,rice,sour cream,lettuce,I also get corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe I'm coming late to this burrito party,I had a better burrito from their Dedham location,but the quality of meat is much better than Anna's Taqueria and the size of the burrito is larger than Boloco's,A solid three stars with an upgrade possible if they can correct the burrito fillings ratio,but I think they still gotta work on their rice to beans to meat ratio,I think the prices are average,the cheese tasted funky,I should get consistent quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The veggie bowl was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place is very clean and the food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been here probably over 100 times over the last few years and this location by far has the nicest employees and the freshest food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a great place to have some fast casual Mexican food,Great place to grab some tacos ,and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love chipotle ,Manager makes employees give tiny servings of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some of the positive standouts include the fact that it doesn't seem as ridiculously busy as most chipotles,I don't think you'd regret coming here if you're in the mood for chipotle,fluffy white rice),blackened chicken,One weird negative here is the sprite tastes like heavily carbonated water,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Per usual the food was delicious,I came j to the chipotle bc I saw some article about dollar burritos,Eat at this chipotle,But that didn't stop me from getting a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(Don't food coma in the theatre like I almost did),Not much else to say besides the food here was good,and I didn't get food poisoning,This was an awesome chipotle with huge,That makes a 5 star chipotle if you ask me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even though we love going to chipotle because their food is good,The line will move once you get up to the counter and order your food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This time they didn't have black beans,Missing multiple ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your burrito will be half the size of the typical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,its got a bit of a tang but its great on the rice bowls,you can ask for plain rice with no cilantro ,The prices are not that high,my husband and I can eat there with 2 bowls ,They have a couple different salsa's,and 2 drinks and chips for around 20 bucks,I think its the best of the meats,I usually get the steak,I have started asking for the salad dressing, quality,It tastes great and its good quality,everything looks and tastes,It tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Same burritos,bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was 20 people in front of me and i got my food in 7 minutes,The food is delicious,the manager came out and asked how my food tasted, When I finished she came back out and removed my empty bowl,chicken,I ordered a salad with fajitas,The vinaigrette is amazing and a perfect compliment to the salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Places like this on top of the food safety concerns are going to drive chipotle out of business,Another completely messed up my burrito,We love chipotle,One attendee didn't know what pinto beans are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came in this chipotle for the first,Only down side is they are very skimpy on there bowls:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just no cheese or sour,and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't know if I got older or chipotle just got worse,The rice is horrible,off the places with plantains and fresher ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also expect something to be wrong with your food every time,Today I ordered a Barbacoa and Steak bowl ,or old (chips),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent food with excellent,This place really hit the spot when I was craving a good burrito,  The ingredients were fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delicious footballs of burrito goodness made on the spot,Ask them for extra of anything you want except for the guacamole or meat(s) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I order my food on the app,Food is always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey it's chipotle,I love chipotle,Once the chips were stale,and they had run out of chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's just something a little off with the beans,but it ruins everything--so my advice is skip the black beans, Rice was sufficient and the chips are good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do not recommend this location due to this lack of caring for the quality of food ,I ordered a burrito bowl , I walked out of the restaurant when the server dropped the pork on the very dirty counter picked it up with her dirty gloved hand and put it back in my bowl,When I told her I did not accept that bowl she rolls her eyes at me at that point I left,when looking at the beans ,thepinto beans were completely dried ,and crusty they were out of black beans the grilled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Usually this place is really good abs their chicken has great flavor but today food was crap,Both with the food ,and lots of pieces of bone and tendons in the chicken too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now that I have vented about all that it is time to try my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I sat and contemplated whether to go in and ask for the manager but in looking at the staff I didn't see anyone who looked more than 20 years old and just threw our food away ,When we get to the counter this young lady is responsible for finishing toppings and rolling burritos,They all had burritos ,four burritos in a row she ripped open,and she ripped all of them and then ask for a bowl to put them in,I start looking at it and realize she has a piece of wood in her bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never been able to finish a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get the bowl ,and maximize my beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All I'm asking is that this chipotle be fair and step it up a little and serve the correct portion instead of being lazy and refilling their station with food ,I am a loyal customer here at this chipotle ,but today the workers that were making my bowl hardly putting any steak in my bowl as they normally do so of course  I would ask for a touch more of steak ,I feel like this is ridiculous thing to complain about but all I wanted was a normal steak bowl ,When I say this I didn't mean I want double steak I just want a normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And to top it off they were one of the slowest chipotles I have ever been too,I barely even got a scoop of rice for my RICE BOWL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As we moved along the station to select items it was clear that the food was becoming dry,I looked around and the dining room was totally filthy with food ,I love the food,but it makes me uncomfortable about the quality of preparation ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it only took a couple minutes to get my food,Plus they are very generous with their guacamole portions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the rice in my burrito was no good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Smells like a locker room and food is blah at this location for some reason,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stopped in to grab two burritos ,I asked for both beans and was told I was going to be charged extra (I always in many different chipotles order both beans ,This has to be one of the worst chipotle I have ever been in,First off the there was just plain rice,No cilantro lime on either rice choices,and a bowl,Next I asked for corn salsa ,I added green salsa to hopefully add some taste ,Then the lettuce I had to ask twice to add a bit more,No joke just corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually order online and I love the feature of the drive thru to pick up online orders that way and they have always been super quick to answer the window and deliver the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however food's still good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
high quality food that Chipotle is known for,avocado skin and vegetable stems in my food,It's hard to justify paying $9+ when the food is so frequently a disappointment,but I have also had several issues at this location like undercooked rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location has consistently good quality food, Never runs out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't know if they go through so much and aren't cooking it long enough but I seriously have to drive all the way to Dr Phillips to get good chipotle,Lord have mercy can you all cook your white rice correctly,I don't know how many times I've ordered a bowl to go and the rice is half cooked,Still bad rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are full staffed and the food is fresh,The chips were also fried to perfection ,The flavor is on point with the meat selection ,and the guacamole is the bomb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had asked for chicken in my burrito bowl,he asked for chicken as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when I got my food my rice was cold actually nothing was hot,I ordered white rice black, beans chicken tomatillo salsa corn salsa with cheese, and they forgot the tomatillo salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got my food wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We had a sofritas burrito which only half of it was eating it was pretty big,but we were charged for chips which we did NOT order ,and a salad I was hungry so I ate it all and two beers and our total came to 20 $3 including the chips we did not get for order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was made in such,and today I was in to try their new chorizo burrito,I then ordered said burrito ,This may be nitpicking but if your job is to roll a burrito you should be able,to know how to roll a burrito ,and stop joking around with your coworkers and pay attention to what you're doing because now the burrito is broken ,and watched in horror as she rolled it with zero skill and zero concern for quality, poor quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I returned to chipotle with the bowls to get my money back but I was told I couldn't because I paid in cash and the cashier never gave me a receipt when I paid for the food,After reading all the reviews on here about food poisoning at this location I hope that I am not the next,Worst chipotle experience ever,all together the worst tasting chipotle I've ever ate,I got 2 bowls to go,the chicken was slimy,the lettuce was stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always go for their burrito bowls,I love the way they season the chicken and have it over brown rice with black, beans & load up on the toppings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm so glad the burrito I got tonight was not my first,The rice ,The rice was undercooked,and steak had absolutely no taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sure the food was really great,but it could've done without the leaf from an outside tree in my burrito bowl,and all with the chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this location always has very fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are out of chips,Last time I ate here the chips were soggy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my most recent visit I was rewarded with a new sensation-food poisoning,I would have gotten more food , chicken burrito,but this time I noticed they skimped on rice,chicken ,and beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gimme a good spoonful of chicken- no baby scoops,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not that person that cry's when I get a small bit of something I didn't ask for in my food,it's been rice ,I'm guessing they ran out of stuff because it was super bowl weekend ,it's been chicken before,and beans on another occasion before,A few times it's been were out of our ingredients,it's forgetting to put all the ingredients into my order,or delivery services like Postmates is always missing ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Out of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've noticed commonalities between the BC and BU chipotles with poor food quality,not enough food product,Worst chipotle I've ever had,Apparently chipotles that are on college campuses sacrifice quality ,if you go to the chipotle in back,Threw out 3/4 of my bowl,chicken was poorly cooked,Oh and the fact that the only meat that looks half way edible is the chicken,even the cheese was weird,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
allowing customers to stand and speak loudly over the plexiglass directly into the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a bowl for pickup,I open the bowl ,and there is sour cream in my bowl,This bowl had ingredients I didn't order,my side of guacamole was missing,"Her response was ""we ran out of guacamole"" ",and the sour cream was a mistake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been eating chipotle for years and every time I go there I get good service and good food,good food,Keep up the good work chipotle your food will always have a place in my heart,The bowl is awesome the burrito is like a bowl all raped in a tortilla which is really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One girl took her whole mask off in the kitchen and was loudly talking to everybody over the food about how she's going on break ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Few issues they need to work on with the line and the food quality,My food kind of sat there like it was tumbleweed in an ab,I ordered a burrito bowl ,My fiancé had the same issues with her chicken bowl,the chips were stale,The meat was a bit dry,the guacamole had eerie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the Chipotle when you want a BIG BOY burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a normal salad bowl ,My bowl,And my chips were basically bottom,of the bag chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tip: It's a reasonable expectation when you eat here that the assembly of the food order you pick out will be very fast, I went with an order of chicken salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We had to get our own baskets and trays to carry to food to the table,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep an eye on how your food is prepared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I thought chipotle is always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The customer service has been pretty top notch and the food has tasted pretty great,burrito bowls covered in so much, sour cream that our bowls were soupy,I like watching the staff make my bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$17 for a chicken burrito with guac ,and a side of chips with queso,If your gonna charge people for chips could you at least serve them fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The quality of the food is good,and I shared my steak burrito/,my son had a chicken burrito with white,  The burrito can be messy so be careful, My daughter had the rice bowl, white rice with my hubby, rice,Prices aren't so bad,the taste was okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
regardless of how many times I order this location's food the food tastes weird,in general the food at this chipotle, tastes way different than a normal chipotle locati,mushy rice,twice my chicken has been under-cooked,brown/oxidized guacamole and the protein(chicken) i,So i put 1 star because the chips are fine, they taste as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is honestly the worst chipotle in the US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Chipotle's food ,I've placed a handful of orders and typically order a salad,Well the salad dressing is always missing,So I figured this time around when I order I'll give the store a phone call and kindly remind them to include the salad dressing with my order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for extra lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We kind of inhaled our food ,Big ass burritos just aren't my thing,The tortilla-less burrito bowl was soooo,but will also be going back to try the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you're looking for real Mexican food,you'll have better food ,The staff doesn't even scoop out an entire spoon and put it in bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they barely had any food items left,this place needs to get there food to human,.food was good,they had no white rice,no black beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered online and just wanted to tell them not to make my food yet as I wasn't going to be there yet,Even if there is nobody in line I will wait several minutes for my bowl and watch one person at a time leave with their food way before me,Called 3 times tonight at 7:52pm on March 4th no answer any of those times there no way that chipotle is packed at 8pm to the point where I was holding for over 3 minutes on the first,It's definitely time over quality with every order over there which I'm sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a burrito bowl through door dash,Was half way through my bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then I get my burrito ,Today I tried again this time getting a chicken bowl ,and once again disappointed as the chicken was fatty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was finally time for me to order and I veggie burrito,Started with a gigantic burrito,quac is included with veggie burrito,white rice with pinto, beans,cheese,sour cream,and lettuce,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On several occasions I've just left and went over to Piada where I got my food before I would have been able,The only redeeming quality is that I can walk there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the cashier was ignoring when I asked for chips on purpose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When it comes burritos, The steak burrito with rice,pinto beans,and cheese wasn't terrible,lettuce,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They then sent him to a different chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered double meat and it was the smallest burrito i had ever seen, It was mostly rice ,and had very little ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the restaurant uses the freshest ingredients to prepare your food, All of these food items,there is a divider that separates the table areas from the line for food,which is good because you won't have someone awkwardly standing right next to your table while they wait for their food ,I've always felt that they get your food to you much,Another great thing about Chipotle is that the food here is very affordable,Burrito Bowl (burrito ingredients without the tortilla,and you just walk down and point to what you want in your quesadilla/taco/burrito/burrito, The burrito bowl is excellent,I made a separate category for the burrito itself, One of the best aspects of the franchise is that you can put anything and everything in your burrito, I've seen people opt to put a bit of all the available ingredients in their burritos before,For my burritos,but they will still usually give you a full scoop of each meat for your burrito: unless the person making your burrito is stingy, When you're ready to eat your burrito,because the burritos are so fat, They also aren't stingy about how much of the ingredients they stuff into your burrito, The only catch is that because of the massive size of the burritos, I've had completely open burritos,you can eat a massive burrito for like, The soft shell and crispy shell tacos are both great,but if you're getting your tacos to go,served in a bowl), bowl,or will opt for half steak and half chicken (because that's a way to bypass the extra,I've had some employees who stuff the tortilla with too much cheese and not enough meat, meat charge,I'll also ask them to include extra steak (which you will be charged extra, I think I've tried everything here except the salad,you can choose what ingredients to put in, The ingredients are all on display at different,the ingredients I use are,because I want the ingredients mixed,rather than have each ingredient separated into different,though the quality can change quite drastically based on who makes it, The quesadillas generally taste very good,which still tastes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love chipotle,The ingredients were not separated (sloppily mixed with the others),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went back again today and got the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you like spicy food,the bag didn't include any chips,How does a franchise like this forget chips that are in a pre-packaged,it has a nice mix between spicy and being flavorful (the lettuce tones down the spiciness a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food,Most chipotle stores are relatively consistent,They also run out of ingredients often,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wrong kind of food in orders,giving me other people's orders and just now charging me twice for my food ,so ended up paying 26$ for my 18$ chipotle now driving all the way back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Positively wretched food,Ordered two steak Keto bowls for takeout this evening,the whole bowl completely out of balance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love this food buy don't underst,and the small amount of food given,I asked for more rice ,Today I ordered a Barbadoa bowl,No beans,"and said ""since I don't get beans"" ",and she dropped a small amount onto the meat,With mild tomatoes with  Sour cream and cheese,So she as putting my lid on I asked her why she skimped on the sour cream and cheese ,Not even a full scoop of sour cream and just a pinch of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also if you like plastic in your burrito this is the place to go,but don't care too much about the quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bowl was pretty tasteless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fantastic customer service and quantity of food,The serving size of ginormous and the food is hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Poor excuse for a chipotle's,Not at all like a normal chipotle's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our rice was even undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after the servers put together her food,They gave a lot less food then at other,and the way the server put together her food was not appetizing looking,The kid who ate the food complained about the size portion,Overall the food was just ok,When I went to pay for my food,I'm not sure why the servers at this location are so stingy and slow at preparing the food,I also ordered a burrito,she did not receive the regular amount of rice,Her chicken was burnt,he complained that his black beans tasted funny,The topping sides that I wanted from the online menu were mild salsa,I had a coupon sent to me for a free meal with a purchase of any meal (excluding kids meal) and one coupon for free guac and chips with the purchase of any meal (excluding kids meal,I gave the coupon for free guac and chips to the cashier,I would get the guac and chips free,The manager took the coupon and and scanned it after entering into the cash register that I ordered guac and chips,so I did end up getting the guac and chips free,I ordered a Kid's Cheese Quesadilla with steak,and the server was about the put in a decent amount of steak into the quesadilla,but the server said that she could either have the sour cream or cheese,My sister also wanted to get sour cream with hers,lettuce,and his father tasted it ,and complained that it tasted not right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was ice cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stopped in to pick up dinner for a birthday celebration and one of the employees was rude throwing the food in the bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You'll literally stand there for 20 minutes while the person behind the counter makes someone's food who's isn't even there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food doesn't taste very fresh,The chicken I had in my fajita bowl tasted like it was 2 days old,I felt like the quality of the meat could been been fresher for a lunch,I feel like this Chipotle is just okay quality,Hoping for better quality on my next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A girl was chewing gum while preparing food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well for starters there service was super unprofessional and all their food was under seasoned,and tasted like nothing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typical good Chipotle food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was really bad,sloppily thrown in my bowl,I called to let them know my guacamole was brown ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  The combination of food was really good,chicken, I got the salad with black beans, Forgot the cheese,mild and medium sauces and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never gotten such little food,The taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the burrito bowl with chicken ,I would come back and support them since chipotle is one of that great,and all the extra stuffs like rice ,The rice seems to be undercooked,When I picked it up and it seems like it's missing the items I requested on the bowl ,beans ,lettuce ,corns ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 When's finally my turn they make a store wide announcement that they are out of guacamole completely in addition to having to wait further for new batches of black beans,two if the salsa's,Several of the people that ordered on line were waiting for 20 minutes when they heard the new about the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love my neighborhood Chipotle HOWEVER I am frustrated that they run out of salad dressing by evening, PLEASE figure this out so I can leave a great review and return to  being happy about eating your yummy salads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The seating is a bit strange at this location but it seemed most people just got their food to go,I personally do prefer the burrito ,00 it wasn't too bad for the burrito bowl,The chicken tasted fresh and I decided to try my first chipotle bowl,The calories at chipotle add up really fast if you get chips ,I wish that chipotle had a combo,and chips,deal where I could get a drink and chips with my meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am sorry chipotle but your food is gross,and your prices for the food are ridiculous,but when you spend $6 dollars on two tacos ,I am no chipotle fan,My biggest issue here is the quality of meat that chipotle claims is good,The chicken is always fatty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How do I eat a salad with NO Dressing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty expensive for a burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Huge chipotle fan ,I don't get rice or beans so asked for fajita,and make my pitiful bowl,Meat is cold first off which is disgusting and I now don't even want to touch cold chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Hot food,Chose to come to this chipotle because reviews on other,good quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the filling in my tacos were sparse,I order for pick up from this chipotle pretty regularly,When I received my order I was missing the chips to my chips ,including the chips that,I had accidentally ordered only a side of queso and not the side of chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle sucks,Find a different chipotle,I also don't like how they don't center things in the bowl (sour,all the salsa on the right) so it's hard,they also forgot the corn and medium salsa,2 weeks in a row now I ordered a salad (bc the dressing is literally the best thing in the world,I have now been looking forward to the salad dressing for 2 weeks bc they screwed it up last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle and enjoy their food,I'm fine with that as long as I get my food,They do not always provide me with the sides for my chips when I get the drive thru food ,I always get crunchy tacos ,and three different times they gave me soft tacos,and this time they didn't give me my guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle but for some reason the food here doesn't compare to other,The cilantro lime rice that all chipotle's have ,and are known for is just plain white rice or plain white,rice at this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The guy making the burrito put several,I showed her my badge and she told me we had to get the same entree (burrito/burrito,I realized she didn't even put the burrito in the bag,bowl/bowl, different ingredients on that I did not ask for (even though I was st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They run out of food often as well,Always super over crowded there's always someone in life ordering 50 burritos,I hate this chipotle location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I travel for this one because always a good quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I got a bowl which was way more food it seemed than an ordinary,and we had trouble finding a semi clean place to sit and eat once we had our food,I felt that our food was a bit expensive,Since the food was really good,The food was worth,My companion got a burrito,I went a new way for me as I have never been truly happy with their burritos, burrito,brown rice ,I got the brown rice,Also there are no clearly marked prices anywhere that I noticed, I will not begrudge them the higher price,They got chicken with black, beans,black beans ,and the works except salsa,with hot salsa, compared to similar places that also give you chips with your meal while here you pay extra,cheese ,and lettuce,Since there are now 2 locations fairly close to us I wanted to try them again as a couple of the places we do go have been slipping in service and or quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst location :( I ordered a salad ,The salad ended up being fine,I opened my bank app and saw I had been charged twice for one salad so I went back up to ask for this to be fixed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have no clue how to wrap burritos ,Once they were out of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food itself was more then delicious,I love chipotle,But the manager feels horrible about it makes it right away puts extra everything in our bowls ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63 via doordash for a burrito bowl here that was barely half,There was also barely any rice,It was a simple order of brown rice,In the bowl there was barely any steak,I had asked for beans,No beans included in the dish,black beans,I had paid extra for additional steak,steak,cheese,and lettuce -- that's it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mita your typical chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have been to many chipotle restuarants bescause my boys enjoy the burritos,Terrible customer service and I'm convinced the staff is pressured by management to make the smallest burritos possible,the burrito was no bigger than a egg roll,I only hope that the boys will be won over by Anna's tacqueria which is the next closest burrito place,I ordered extra white rice so I could try to get a normal,I get two half scoops half scoop of beef and black beans half scoop of corn ,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On several occasions I've just left and went over to Piada where I got my food before I would have been able,The only redeeming quality is that I can walk there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They barely filled my bowels and ordered extra steak and extra rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fresh,The food line was running low,The food looked as though it had been sitting out for a while,ALL of the tables had food or drink spilled on them that hadn't been wiped down,This chipotle has really gone down hill,the chipotle was my regular,I came into chipotle today for lunch ,I am typically a guacamole LOVER,The lettuce was also brown,Highly disappointed in the quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location the food is usually fresh,I always get the bowl with my favorite,My bowl was good,fresh and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not sure how but through it all the food is good,Will this location ever have guacamole,Numerous times we have placed a to go order or delivery and there is never any guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a burrito bowl ,I ordered the chicken and before I could switch my mean she scraped dried and hard chicken from the bottom of the container onto my bowl,I try my best not to complain at a restaurant but I ate about two bites and threw the rest of my bowl away,I understand that a place is slow that time of the week but I still expect to receive the same quality as I would at other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the person rolling my burrito couldn't complete the task ,Multiple ingredients were not stocked on the line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I order steak with cheese and rice ,and this is what i get keep in mind im picky so i only asked for three ingredients and this is what i get 10 pieces of steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was extremely salty,Not sure if they had put too much salt or seasoning into the ingredients or what ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Made my burrito way too full,I appreciate the extra chicken an guac that was in my burrito,This chipotle only had forks as utensils which made eating the overflowing burrito even harder to eat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they'll acknowledge it and make everyone's food who walks in before you first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got a bowl,Bowl just tasted like char,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Order a burrito bowl from here ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had to toss mine and my husband's barbacoa bowls,Good guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She was very fast but extremely sloppy and threw my food in the bowl like she was scooping dog food,I asked for a bowl with white rice,The chicken looked,beans,a little guacamole,I said just a little guacamole,steak,The steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered tacos ,they literally just dump all of it in the bowl ,and they put it in a bowl ,the past few times I ordered double steak they didn't even put enough for a single,the quality freaking sucks everytime I order from there using the mobile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I never got my food,so basically I'll prob not have chipotle again until covid is over,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food,whether gluten or food poisoning bacteria,I had a carnitas bowl with brown rice ,and salsa verde with a side of chips ,and guacamole,I went around the corner ,was delicious,I have no complaints about the freshness or quality of my meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Four stars for good food,I ended up getting the bowl of barbacoa,salsas salad ,and cheese with peppers ,It was very delicious without me feeling stuffed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Was the food h,Spent the last 12 hours throwing up all the chipotle ,Will not be coming to chipotle agai,The steak was a bit undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They barely filled my bowels and ordered extra steak and extra rice ,Only gave me a 1/4 bag of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't go here unless you want your entire bowl covered in sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Hot food was cold,and cold food was warm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was OK -- no problems there,at least have him stand away from where you make the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I highly recommend stopping by and grabbing some food,My order burrito was treated with extreme,was an very kind and courteous manager and made sure my experience at chipotle was one to remember,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I guess getting a burrito bowl sans tortilla can reduce the calories by a whopping,And the price- just,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3rd time in a row I came in/waited in line for them to tell me (after making half my order) that they are out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They've been ""out of brown rice"" twice in 3 weeks",Frequently they're too slow making chicken or steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle good food ,Line is out the door and they wait till you are up to the front to tell you they're out of the main ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I started at the beginning of the food selections line,by the end I knew I would not be eating that food,I really wanted to give them another chance after all the health issues cause who doesn't love a burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this Chipotle was out of red salsa,sour cream,and corn,and is always out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Employees were eating chips in front of customers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband ordered a steak burrito ,and I ordered a chicken burrito bowl,My husband's steak burrito was cold like it just came out of the fridge,My CHICKEN burrito bowl was missing chicken,Forgetting meat in a dish is the reason people think fast food employees shouldn't make more than minimum,it's significantly better quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shame on chipotle management to have Ridiculous store like this they should have new,ill make sure chipotle management know  about this,They don't have Guacamole or red peppers the chicken was served half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This restaurant is inconsistent on food quality ,I've found plastic in my food recently ,Questionable food safety practices,the open kitchen is usually a disaster and lots of cross contamination between POS and food line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
brown rice and chicken were pretty much out but instead of getting more for the burrito bowl I was ordering,So now I'm left with half a burrito bowl ,I have never had a problem when getting chipotle except at this one location,when I want chipotle again I will be willing,the employee scrapped up as much as she could then moved it around my bowl to try to make it look like more,Even when I asked for some more chicken she rolled her eyes ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6PM on a Tuesday evening and the store was dirty with trash on the floor and food stuck to the tables,my food , My order was made wrong (they did offer to remake but declined since brown rice ,and white rice is still rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have fantastic food,took his sweet time bagging my food ,I ordered my food 20 minutes before it said it would be ready,about 40min after I had ordered my food it came out of the kitchen,secondly what kind of kitchen manager allows his restaurant to run out of lettuce during lunch when lettuce is generally a vital part of the food served,I plan to walk out of my way to the food carts,the man who bagged up my tacos was having a full,"with the quick ""want black beans or pinto bleans",by the way we ran out of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was made ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but this one served me raw chicken in my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stopped by there today after leaving the gym to get a burrito &  after asking the food preparation girl to remind me again what the Barbacoa was,One of the food prep cooks wonders over,She then made the burrito incorrectly & ripped it,""" Meanwhile my burrito is wrapped ","picks up my burrito & says ""is this yours",Very poor atmosphere and negative paradigm in this chipotle location,"only to be asked ""what kind of meat do u",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The girl working last night barely gave me any food,I got 6 ingredients and the bowl wasn't even full like the other chipotle places,I finished my meal within 3 minutes and I ordered a bowl,I would expect to have less meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my food was ready,No rice,I ordered two bowls online because it's 2020 ,no corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything was dirty with food everywhere,Made an attempt at eating the burrito but the employee put so much freakin food in the burrito it was so hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never really have had a problem with the quality of food,The food has always been decent,Stick with the burritos or bowls at this location,But I ordered a side of chips yesterday ,approximately 7 chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited 20 minutes for undercooked steak,Also After waiting for the steak they gave me it for free-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got food poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and thick eye lashes) playing around with a boy with dreads (end of dreads were blue or green) they were taking care of take out orders and all they were doing was joking around and laughing at the fact that they were running out of food,( of course I'm going to get annoyed if my pickup order is for 7:45 and it's 8:20 and the order was just for a Burrito and chips) There was another employee (light,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is definitely the worst chipotle I've ever been to,The chicken is always cold,3/5 times I've been there they don't have guacamole,Every time I get a soda it doesn't even taste like soda,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito I had contains avocado that made my throat uncomfortable,Also there is little chicken in my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is my favorite chipotle in the area- the people working here and nice and the food is always good,I ordered tacos,isn't an order of tacos 3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At this location the person who works in food line do not have respect ,Don't have respect for customers and the customers food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle seems to be managed terribly ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thou food was good,surprisingly she hit my hand when i pointed on the brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also they never have Fajita Vegis and don't bother waiting because they don't plan on making more literally said (we're out) no follow up or anything just like they shouldn't exist in the chipotle line up,So I'm vegetarian and apparently guacamole is free when you get a vegi bowl,Then I get a chunk of steak in my Sofritas last night I understand mistakes happen but I'm literally getting tofu because meat is gross,to me and red meat hurts my insides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
little black bugs fly around my food,Frequently the steak is too fatty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I absolutely LOVE chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice wasn't even cooked,Got half chicken half steak-,chicken was completely bl,The guacamole was bland, and and the steak was bl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They always forget my chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food taste okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 To top it all off my bowl tastes like a giant,bowl of salt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The reason for only one star is I had to get my burrito made twice,They tossed out the rice when I complained and had a brand new batch that they used to make my replacement burrito,The second burrito had crunchy,I hadn't had Chipotle in too long and was excited to get a burrito today,because the rice was half-raw, rice as well,And the result is stale chips and crunchy rice,how do you run out of corn salsa,The chips were completely stale,Then the woman behind the counter admitted they had corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really the chips should be included with the burrito ,The chicken burrito was very good,Had to ask someone to wipe down tables and the chips were stale,Just no more chips for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually frequent chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was extremely grateful that she noticed I had the sofritas and made sure my food was safe,I got a bowl with sofritas ,When I got to the end of the line I asked for guacamole ,I told her yes and she said she noticed I had the tofu and was going to get me some of the fresh guac because a little bit of cheese had fell in the one they had on the station,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were more than accommodating and the food tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a bad chipotle location,SUPER skimpy- like half portion of what chipotle normally is),missing ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Go to another chipotle,We ordered to go and our rice ended up being uncooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food that I did purchase was cold,they were out of brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is dependable in terms of quality of food that you pay for,I tend to get the veggie bowl,I love their fresh chunky guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like atmosphere in this Fast food station,Not expensive and always fresh food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nobody can properly roll a burrito,The veggies were not cooked properly nor was the rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we're served our food really fast,it was the ones serving the food,usually when I go to a chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
modern look but not really so modern (no plant based meat option no Apple Pay)  pretty stingy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not to mention no employees can wrap a burrito correctly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is ok,then I asked kindly for her to grab my food she did ewith the worst attitude,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I feel like a true VIP when I walk up to the cashier and walk out with my food in less than 5 min,I've done their Mobile Order more times than I'd care to admit over the past year and rarely run into issues with the food not being ready,I always ask for extra lettuce ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Maybe the food is not being kept hot, Please check the temperatures of the food bins ,Ordered a burrito to go,brown rice,with chicken,pinto beans,tomato salsa,and monterey cheese at 7:50 pm,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Chipotle was closed by the Board of Health because at least 20 people suffered food poisoning there this week,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really like getting the burrito bowl from Chipotle ,so on my burrito bowl it went,no corn salsa,not the corn salsa I ordered,No chips,and was told that unfortunately they were OUT of chips,How does a place that has the word CHIP in their name run out of chips,Without chips,no guacamole,They also handed me a cup of corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got half way home and realized they gave me stale chips which sucks because they are my fav,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes the service and food are both terrible,This chipotle is mediocre,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 pm and the food line had a lot of dried,old food on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the flavor of the food have gone down a lot so as the potion protein ,and quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for a burrito,and I understand that burritos can be very large,But the girl wrapping my burrito barely even wrapped it putting minimal,So I asked her is she can rewrap my burrito (because I don't want my burrito to explode) ,She dumped my burrito onto another tortilla ,And of the course the burrito just fell apart after one bite,I'm not upset about the burrito itself,Very disappointed with the quality of customer service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We visited during early lunch on a weekday and were one of only a couple customers so everything was really efficient and the food was fresh-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a sofritas bowl to go ,and found several pieces of steak inside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finally someone set the chicken aside to start it another 5 minutes after that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I told him to stop eating it because I didn't want him to end up getting food poisoning from the chicken,After he ate it and said it was gross I looked up the reviews and there had been MULTIPLE reports of food poisoning,This chipotle was AWFUL,My boyfriend at his bowl ,and said that the chicken was cold,The chips were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst quality food I have ever been served,I'm embarrassed that this is the quality of food I served to my family,rice ,and the meat was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food was fine,They were about to close and were out of steak and white rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got chips ,Must have been 3 generationsof chips in one bag,soggy chips,The queso had the texture of a reconstituted powdered cheese in look ,Flavor was as close to bland as any queso or plain cheese I've ever had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What type of pick up policy does Chipotle have where anybody can just walk in and pick up food without providing proof of purchase,I found a half-thrown together burrito bowl that is half the normal,portion size along with a half-rolled burrito barely covered with aluminum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On several occasions I've just left and went over to Piada where I got my food before I would have been able,The only redeeming quality is that I can walk there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it's very good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Filthy and out of forks after ordering a salad to eat in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They filled my bowl half way,There were also no chips available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also always make sure I'm getting a lot of food for what I'm paying,The food is always fresh, and tastes incredible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didnt have any meat btw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
please do yourself a favor and go to any other chipotle near by,We had ordered two chicken quesadillas,and the bag of chips was half the normal,Then when we finally got home we realized not only did they forget our guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no rice,it was a chicken salad, The chicken was hot,black beans,fresh tomato salsa,cheese,sour cream,make sure you get this even if you're not having a salad,my salad was LOADED with toppings,and their AMAZINGLY delicious Chipotle-honey vinaigrette,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the remainder of my food wash fresh,The chicken in my salad was a little,My guacamole was green,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ate some food yesterday,Maybe food poison,Because I've always loved chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By far the worst chipotle I've ever been to,they run out of many key ingredients every time I am here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a couple months ago they decided to put the shelf behind the counter and you must be handed your food,these were people waiting to get their food from online,the food is very well made,I have rarely had an issue with their food in general,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband ordered a veggie burrito with guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We went for lunch today and were very disappointed with the customer service at this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chipotle workers here are never prepared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food contamination most likely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I counted no less than fifteen different food items for their online ordering,making that food,The food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Employees touching their hats and hair and not changing there gloves before touching people's food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is like any other chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted great,but the chips were so salty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
during a pandemic when people can't get out and get food themselves,No one called us and informed us that we would t be getting food so we didn't make prior,arrangements to seek food before everything else closed,I called chipotle and not only did they not care that I was getting food for the rest of the evening during a time ,and every review site on the web until someone at chipotle at least pretends to give a damn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always a hit or miss,I decided to come here for my occasional fast-food dinner,I received my food with barely any lettuce + chicken ,and I ordered a keto bowl,of sour cream,There was so much sour cream that nothing else was visible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a double steak burrito bowl with brown,rice through their app for lunch,What I got was a chicken (not double) and white rice bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food a bit bland for my taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I liked the food ,I like that Chipotle let's their customers build their own dish (burrito,burrito bowl etc,I had the steak burrito bowl with the cilantro-lime, rice,I added a little needed textural crunch by crushing a few tortilla chips and mixing them in the bowl,black beans,He packed a fresh package of kid's chips ,The chips were crunchy ,cheese,and sour cream,lettuce,corn,Located on the corner of of Fairbanks ,I had difficulty hearing the staff ask me about the different ingredients I wanted even though we were less than 3 feet apart,) by selecting the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Couldn't finish the burrito bowl I got today,Everything was salty except the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eventually got food (not very busy,Worst chipotle I've been t,) meat was cold,faster and cleaner and up their quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amazing food,Line was out the door and I was able to get my food in 10 minutes,The chips were light,The queso was also delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sub par for chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Was out of a bunch of stuff and the food they had almost two hours before closing was not fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are always out of ingredients ,and the ingredients they do have are old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there were no trays to carry our food to the table  ,I give this chipotle 3 stars because at least I received my order correctly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a salad to be delivered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you go there expect a little bit of food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ingredients were fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito fell apart here so three stars,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great service and delicious food,Like most chipotles the customer service was great,Got the chicken bowl with white rice ,and black beans ,The chips,and all the other wonderful fresh ingredients,always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff was fast and rude food awful,quality they sloppped it on meat was dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staffs are either young working to work or was given a second chance by chipotle to better themselves,I just like their fresh vegetables  and meats ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I decided to go outside my comfort zone and had a burrito bowl ,Updating my review because those are some lackluster chips,Now as for the chips,It's a damn shame that we already have to pay for chips ,I bet Carnivores might even be tricked into thinking it's red meat, So if you're trying to cut back on your red meat/pork intake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so know that the food is high,I see the cooks in the back making fresh ingredients, quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bowl I kept and did not have remade ended up giving me food poisoning,Ordered 2 bowls,online and got home to see that one of my bowls was missing half the ingredients,I'll use my own sour cream,Took it back to have remade and came home again to find out of ingredient was still missing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't even know if I had rice,Was out of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually get the burrito bowl with chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only reason I gave it two stars is because it does deliver on the consistently delicious burritos that we all know ,and I'm not talking a few napkins and pieces of lettuce here ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do yourself a favor and don't go to the westlake chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I swear this is place doesnt want to give you any rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is often cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ingredients here are just as fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chips were also completely stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is tasteless,Stale taco shells,Brown lettuce,The manager says they taste test everything,I've seen them NEVER taste anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the chicken was cooked well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was disgusting,The guacamole was also brown,The lettuce was soggy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a chicken bowl with chips ,The chicken was well seasoned ,but the chips were overly salted ,and not overly salty and the ingredients were fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do yourself a favor and go to another chipotle,its definitely not and that was the first time I've experienced brown guac at a chipotle,The beans were over cooked and the rice was crunchy,I saw the guacamole was brown ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They didn't make more food closer to closing so they could ""go home faster""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a salad with extra white rice,chicken,and mild salsa,extra fajita and corn,She made my order correct and it tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is literally the worst chipotle I've ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is good,I had a delicious veggie bowl with guac on the side ,and kids chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then made me wait halfway through making my bowl so she could chat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have been to this Chipotle a bunch of times and the food is normally spot on,I had to open my burrito this time since the flavors seemed off a bit,I confirmed these contents with the contents of  my wife's burrito bowl as well,I don't think it would stop us from going again but I will be sure to checkout the ingredients before they pop into my burrito,Turns out there was no cilantro or lime in my cilantro lime white rice,It was literally just white rice,Then the salsa was also very odd,since the corn salsa was literally just corn kernels,They didn't indicate they were out of ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He made the bowls his way which were ""meh"" but I think u can never go wrong with (white rice",Please be sure to cook the rice correctly though,black beans,steak,corn and cheese) :) ,sour cream,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is my third time at a chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place refuses to serve one of the items on the chipotle menu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after getting a burrito craving,the chicken in my burrito was sinewy,they also poorly wrapped my burrito to go ,and the cashier was careless throwing the burrito in my to go bag,causing my burrito to partially break,I had to spit out the chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What kind of Chipotle has no hot red salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food was served fresh,Then after we paid for our food ,and dropped bits of food,The two stars I give were for the food only,For a new place with fairly expensive prices for fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Walked down form my office two blocks away to oreder a chicken burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love me some chipotle every now ,The line was all sorts of confused and my bowl got switched with someone else's,I could barely eat my bowl with how spicy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For a place that is based around burritos,I'm about tired of them making my burrito as if they hate me,Can't wait to go eat my soggy/soaked burrito,Is this how you would prepare a burrito for yourself,I don't want a pound of rice,Oh thanks for an entire ladle of hot sauce and chicken juice,I don't need an equal portion of beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered online through Uber eats and I was missing ingredients such as the fucking chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are FIVE people walking around restocking food,Maybe it's because it's Portland but it's stupid I waited 10 mins to get my food being the only,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm just here to get my food,I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the bowl with avocado ,and extra chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bring it to the food prep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these fusion/vegan/hipster food truck burritos are not as good,fast service and are very accommodating if you want extra rice,They always have their rice cooked perfectly,and their meat is always cooked right,less corn,just because they're always super kind and have the freshest ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got my rice,meat in my bowl then I have to wait another few,beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never ever ever coming back they ignored my order after I asked them if they had that burrito,Horrible service horrible customer service and horrible customer service I would say I love chipotle ,Look it up dumass chipotle workers you'll probably know what the hell it is then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is because the food did seem prepared,I was really excited that they opened a chipotle walking distance from me, properly even though the portions were very undersized compared to other chipotles in the area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place is literally the worst chipotle ever the rice wasn't cooked all the way ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is going food ,really I don't think the amount of food given worth the price for the meal,I normally order bowl and I'm used to not get enough meet (unless do you want to pay for double meet) but this restaurant is also getting cheap with the rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is exactly what you'd expect at Chipotle ,I have to say this location (so far) has the best meat,but as an avid steak consumer,A lot of other locations have dry steak from sitting out all day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle ever,Always late on orders and the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I ordered a vegetarian burrito ,and I got a chicken one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food hasn't been ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was beyond disgusted with the burrito they gave me ,No more than 2 minutes time passed when I unwrapped my burrito to find the breath soaked-- as if it had been dipped in water or something,I watched them make the burrito so what could have gone wrong,I've been obsessed with chipotle since 2006 ,I feel like I betrayed my beloved chipotle ,Regardless this will never stop me from eating chipotle,Great ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The ""double chicken"" bowl was half the size of regular",bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the last time I was there they had no chips ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I live literally around the corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I like eating here because the food is consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I mean flat out gets the order wrong with missing food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Either they have terrible managers stocking their food or they are just trying to close early,They appear to not replenish anything past 8:00 and claim they are 'out' of said ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was ON IT,"When you have to order your rice ""plain""",but instead it appears to be cilantro with a little bit of rice mixed,thus certainly impacting quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And I stopped by for a quick bite food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is consistently horrible,This is honestly the worst chipotle,The salad bowl is swimming in water,The steak is always undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also ordered a bag of chips ,and over half the chips were undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Used the app to order - waited 15 minutes AFTER it was supposed to be ready because they literally wait until the line to go down before they make the food,Worst managed chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 First scoop of my bowl and there is a long hair hanging out of the food,I did not tell them it was because there was hair in my food,and they remade a bowl for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the slowest chipotle I've ever been too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The reason I'm not giving them a 1 star even though I want to is because the food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was awful,Terrible food,I absolutely love chipotle ,Then they ran out of white rice ,and instead of asking the other customers if they were getting white rice or brown they decided to hold up the entire,line until I spoke up that I wanted brown rice so I don't need to wait 15 minutes for the white,rice,Super bummed I spent $12 on a bowl ,and chips that ended up in the trash,The meat was awful,They didn't have corn or guacamole which was disappointing,and really missing something without the guacamole ,Sad I paid for the steak,and corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What makes this even a thought process of how you put together any food,Good luck with your food Bexley-goers,it'll show you the burrito that came as a side to my sour,This definitely ruined me from coming back to this chipotle,Maybe chipotle in general,cream and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice,beans,I love their medium salsa (the green,one) and pico de gallo salsa to pair with the chips,salsas,Chipotle definitely has the most superior tortilla chips of any Mexican restaurant I've been to,their chips aren't always consistently fresh,If Torchy's had better chips,They have a great selection of meat,They have a little bit of a lime taste to it ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got food poisoning here so just drive a little, further to go to a better chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Walk to the unmanned food pick up rack where I had sent my daughter in many,minutes ago to pick up our food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
veggies and guacamole so we just left,Today they were out of steak,The staff are always rude and they are consistently out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cold food,old lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think the prices are very reasonable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In terms of food,this chipotle is the best one I've been to,there are three chipotles 10 minutes away from me,There's always something with other chipotles,But this chipotle never fails to satisfy my cravings,this is the slowest chipotle I've been to,maybe avoid this chipotle unless it is empty,the rice is undercooked,the steak is cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is pretty consistent across the board but she took the taste value out of my food just with her twisted,Never written a food review let alone for a food chain like chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the WORST chipotle to ever go to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food was off,Sunday afternoon is not a high volume time for this type of food ,We got 2 bowls ,One bowl was carnitas ,The beans for both bowls were cold,The chicken seemed too wet,and guacamole/chips,and the meat was a bit dry,I'm giving them a 3 for now due to the few quality issues, and did not taste the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just got through ordering a burrito ,filled my burrito with 4 of them,I love chipotle ,and they gave me literally a teaspoon of protein and upon seeing the corn was near empty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they skimped on everything even the rice tonight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
am I on a diet or is there a food shortage,Half a veggie bowl at the full price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food tastes up to the st,andards of other Chipotles and I would even say they definitely have a better cook making the rice is fully cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great mexican food - easy takeout - pick up inside the door,Great food & reasonable, prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they never have any chips I've gone three times ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one person working the entire food line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is pretty consistent with food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I noticed that the food hadn't been that great,The final nail in the coffin came after I tasted my food,My boyfriend and I each ordered a burrito ,First of all the burritos weren't labeled so we had no idea who had what,The guy mislabeled out burritos even after my boyfriend pointed out that he had mixed them up,and my little girl got the childs crispy taco meal,the steak was beyond well done ,Although there were several different ingredients in it,free is not a substitute for quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Better to just order your food in the store,This chipotle is seriously short,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I thought the amount of chicken in the two scoops was fantastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Writing this review as I'm waiting for my food,It's been 50 minutes since I placed my order online and the food is nowhere to be seen,"Otherwise you'll be waiting for at least an hour for some ""fast"" food",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some of the chips were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have ordered through their mobile app many times and every time I arrive my food is never ready,My order is never done correctly & food always seems to taste off,Last time I ordered from that I got food poisoning so I haven't been back since,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it was much appreciated and the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You'd think dining in would remove the possibility of food being made incorrectly,ESPECIALLY their guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAIR in my burrito,wanted black beans,looked to the back and asked for beans,It took another 10 minutes just to get from the beans to the cash register with NO special,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food at chipotle is food at chipotle,you get swamped and orders can get messed up but send somebody to another chipotle ,I've always found chipotles to be great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food as always,I also like the quality of their foods,I love that they have both brown rice & salads here,My only wish is for guacamole to be included or at a lower price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's the food equivalent of a spring break trip to Cancun,The beans were soggy, and the guacamole (usually Chipotle's specialty) was just okay,somewhat healthy meal at most Chipotle's but the reason this location gets 2 stars is that the ingredients don't taste as fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had to put my own lid on my bowl and bag my own food because no one seems to know what's going on,The girl behind me grabbed her food ,Worst chipotle I have ever been too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only did they make my food like crap,even in different states and this has to be the worst customer service experience I've ever received at chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food prep,area had food spilled everywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To the food,They specifically were only offering tacos and burritos with limited,I personally had chicken tacos,Other friends got tacos as well,"as they were having a special ""free chips"" offer on Uber Eats","received the ""free chips"" which are always the best part of a Chipotle visit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she wasn't to happy with that so she made sure to throw my hot salsa on top of my food instead of on the side like I had asked ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No one cares and the food shows,all taco shells ,steak tastes like cardboard on most days and chicken might as well be canned,and chips stale,The guacamole is old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went in today and ordered a veggie bowl and another bowl that just had rice ,They charged me both the price as veggie,I have been going to this location for the past year and they have never charged me rice ,"and beans with having sour cream and cheese on the side as it being as a veggie bowl "" price""", bowls,and beans, For Rice and beans with cheese,And had sour cream and cheese on the side, For Rice  with cheese ,and sour cream on the side I always got charged $1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Twice I've walked in at 9:15pm and have had been told were out of cheese and meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight I tried again - got our food ,because something was totally OFF - my son said it tasted,then my husband dug in and said the sane thing - so I tried and yes same thing : everything tasted like soapy or dirty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go through the line and watch them make your food,In the past we would get a delivery or pick and end up calling the restaurant to explain the mistakes and then drive back up to get our corrected food,My burrito had crunchy rice,My husbands burrito was completely wrong,We have given this particular chipotle MANY,had 5 pieces of chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The reason being because the person making my food can't focus because other,But when I get very little meat in my tacos that I am paying $8 for 3 of,I wouldn't have even minded this been an honest mistake such as it being to busy or not enough meat,I'm giving this a one star not because of quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came here with my bestie & we both enjoyed our food,Took quite a bit to get through the line but that meant the food being served was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible service and unedible food,Used app to order and still had to wait on food for almost 45 minutes,And then the the steak was cold when I got the food home to eat,And 2 pieces of the steak were not edible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is a great place to go for great food at a convenient location ,Its a chipotle thing,Brown rice,TIP: I learned that you can ordered the salad and add rice,so its equivalent to a bowl with lettuce on the bottom,folded it in half and put like 5 pieces of chicken in there for the kids,pinto beans,spicy salsa,Its always great to see people cutting up freshly cooked meat ,and cheese,sour cream,The salad was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They rush all of their burritos ,and don't strain any items prior to putting them into the burrito,It always has a ton of liquids inside and it makes the Bottom of the burrito all soggy,Would be nice to spend an extra 10 seconds and give a nice proper burrito,I eat at chipotle all the time,For some reason this one specific chipotle is my least favorite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The girl serving the meat was like meticulously measuring the amount of food being served,It looks like half a bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This African American female employee who was serving at the salsa section on October 23,2017 Monday at 12:55 pm threw a small empty salsa container at me ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a charge to my card that was not fulfilled and some bum was somewhere eating my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plus the food is always hit or miss at this location,I'm literally waiting to order and the cashier is going back and forth with a customer in regards to how much cauliflower rice was giving to her,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They give you about half as much food as other,They don't allow the beans to drain at all before putting them in your burrito,so the burrito is dripping wet by the time you get to eating it,I love chipotle,this is probably the worst chipotle I've ever been to, chipotle locations,Just all around poor quality chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no one in line and it took them 20 minutes to make our bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worker whose neck was covered in hickeys went to the large chip bowl behind the register,and proceeded to dip said chip into the large guacamole bowl ,To note: both bowls are for paying customers ,and not personal bowls of his,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a peak time for eating food,which they tried to use in my burrito,I suppose there was no way to foresee that people might want either rice or chicken in their burritos,Went in at dinner time (7ish) and they were out of both white rice ,But chicken and white rice were entirely unavailable,and chicken,they're not very popular ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was greeted as soon as I walked through the door with a smile and the guys behind the line preparing food were great,They fixed my food quickly ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went on Cinco De Mayo and was pretty excited for my tacos,I have been to many chipotles ,I discovered that they all had salsa on them,I like them with cheese,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I returned to this location to pick up food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a shame because I love chipotle ,Placed an order about 40 minutes before they closed and was waiting here for 10 minutes watching them clean and then after already having paid for my order I was informed they were out of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I'd ordered a burrito filled with incompetence ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted old,Though I was surprised that the food wasn't well stocked seeming that they had enough,Hopefully they can step up their game at least with the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The girl who serves the food ( white, short girl is a RACIST) when I was there at lunch time she felt some chicken out of the bowl ,and she kept it back in the bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is pretty good,Want your food fast,I ordered my food on the app,the food is good,If you want you food prepared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Twice now I've gotten a burrito that is 1/3 of the size of a normal,chipotle burrito ,all rice,literally no meat in there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was no rice (after 5 minutes white,rice was ready,no one could give an estimate of when the brown rice would be ready,so I opted for the salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sunday afternoon is not a high volume time for this type of food ,We got 2 bowls ,One bowl was carnitas ,The beans for both bowls were cold,and guacamole/chips,and the meat was a bit dry,I'm giving them a 3 for now due to the few quality issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
large seating area well-separated from the food line so it feels a bit fancier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my bowls are always really skimpy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is pure comfort food - tasty ,I always get the same thing - a chicken bowl with white rice,black beans,tomato salsa ,lettuce and a touch of the hot salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is,chipotle food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've come to the conclusion that the people who have rated Chipotle over three stars have never had real Mexican food,Mexican has to be my number one food in the world,I witnessed the food prepers throw away three burritos because they busted open,There is so much food waste it doesn't even matter,13 mess of a burrito,The rice has no flavor,the black beans are pretty, decent and the green salsa/tomatillo was good,it is great that they might use organic or free range meats,they used paper napkins to clean sour cream off the counter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 When there was a half of scoop of rice left it was put in my bowl,the chick looked around and when more rice didn't magically appear without effort on her part,she thought she'd just continue on and pretend that I didn't get screwed on rice,get me more rice damn it,I'm not sure this even deserves two stars but I was so hungry that it still tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food itself seemed a little,It was a basic veggie burrito,It was a tiny burrito ,I am a huge fan of chipotle,had I not had chipotle at several,I asked for extra rice ,There was definitely no extra rice or salsa,and extra salsa,and right around the corner from the midtown location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when I went to order my food I asked for a salad ,You would think that the Chipotle that gave the entire Boston College community food poisoning would pick up their act,was the fact that my chicken was not only burnt ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a chicken burrito ,and had to request that the server actually fill the spoon with meat,Went to eat and the meat was stone cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Needless to say I had to leave without getting my food after a long,When I showed up at 8 pm they did not have rice available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1) All toppings for my burrito were on my wife's bowl,3) I ordered a burrito ,2) Got the toppings correct but left Guacamole off the bowl,and got a bowl,  And wife is done as she said there was almost no meat on her bowl, The only thing correct was the meats,Then the app will let you add reward (birthday guacamole) to the order,but your quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 When I get home to eat my food,I suggest the food managers ,but simply turning the food warmer off hours before store closes puts customer's health at risk, The rice ,the rice was cold,I stopped by this store to get 3 chicken bowls on my way home from work,and chicken couldn't be more than 80F,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and most incompetent human beings I have ever seen in food service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super disappointed in the way the apprentice General Manager Dwayne King handled my wrong food order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chicken was pink,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To many times I come here and the food is either half, cooked or the burritos are wrapped half,You shouldn't have to spend 100 dollars to get a free burrito etc,Might wanna look into this store chipotle corporate,By the way your chipotle rewards are plain, ass to the point it might as well be a salad instead,I advise everyone to go other places until they can get their quality under control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only was the food fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered my bowl to go ,and I have to tell the server three times to put a little more cheese on my bowl,Instead the server push my open bowl towards me,I get to the cashier register and open my chip bag which has a handful of stale chips in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The management is top notch and keeps the store clean and gets me my food as fast as possible,I have placed online orders and they are always filled accurately and the food tastes delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it's true about the undercooked chicken and food poisoning from other,That Chipotle on Boyleston is the worst Chipotle I've been to in terms of chips (luckily didn't buy any more than chips at this location,stale chips there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
guacamole,Staff is rude and they're stingy with ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grabbed napkins over overflowing trash cans and dodged chunks  of cheese and various other mexican food items,They made my burrito across a counter full, of sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was not able to order any of the food they were put of most key,How does a chipotle run out if cheese,and guacamole at 7pm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been craving a burrito from Chi,no corn salsa,No meat ,i kept eating with the hope of finding the meat ,definitively not even a picture of corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expect food to be hot,if the workers are going to act like that they better not complain when servers and the food industry treats them like shit back,smh worst chipotle ever I'm nice to all my customers and try to get their food fast ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito maker who was servicing me was training,I was informed about Chipotle rewards and a chance to win burritos for a year,and price-point I enjoy,As someone who is health-conscious and extremely active Chipotle has the taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle I've ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8pm on Sunday night and this store is out of tortilla chips,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Asked the girl for double meat she proceeds to put two half scoops on my burrito then ,The gentleman next me said he had a single scoop and clearly had more meat on his burrito then I,I kinda asked the girl next to her if she thought that was double meat or not she just stared at me blankly,unfortunately i already paid for this mediocre tortilla fill sour cream ball,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wouldn't exchange a bad guacamole side without a receipt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got myself a veggie burrito bowl on a weekday,"and surprisingly there was no ""chipotle line""",If you like chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In spite of liking the dine in food ,Chipotle's pathetic app and apathetic male employee the cared not that my chicken bowl I ordered on the app ,and picked up and opened at home to find no chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you want to wait for an hour for a half filled bowl missing ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never received less food than I do with this particular,This is the third consecutive time that I've gone to this location and the white guy with glasses barely filled up my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ordered / received their food within 5-7,Just walk in and get your food made,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my kids are waiting for their food to be cooked & warmed,Worst chipotle ever,Other bowls we just ordered were COLD,Left out the drink and the chips for my kid's meal order - found out after we got home,Large bag of chips I ordered were stale,just gave us the cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not sure if there is lack of management or lack of training but rarely has the food been prepared correctly or all of the items in an order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Person making bowl literally threw food in the bowl, I got a steak burrito, Again everything was thrown on burrito,My husband got a bowl, I asked for lite guacamole ,and when I saw he put on a lot and told him he took some off and put it back in the guacamole container, The steak was ice cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was carelessly slopped together in my burrito bowl,The chips I got we're also stale,It didn't taste fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not to mention my black beans were har,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most chipotle's in Columbus ha w gotten,You get a spoonful of rice literally,Asked for double chicken ,Peppers do not have the same taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food looked sad,I ordered a steak burrito with black,Diminutive size compared to mom-and-pop burrito places- a moot point because I didn't finish it,white rice, beans,flavorless black beans,Chewy cubes of steak meat,cheese,flavorless cheese,and sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and walk out super quick with fresh food,The other complaint is that the food here is OFF,you can go to any other Chipotle and the chicken will have that nice,at this Chipotle the chicken seems like its steamed or something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was so much food for the price it ended up being three meals,I used to frequent chipotle in Massachusetts quite often, I got the veggie bowl with tofu, I forgot how good the ingredients are for a chain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They lady was very sweet and they packed my bowl with a lot,which isn't uncommon when you order a veggie bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
while she is sitting in this chipotle's parking lot,This chipotle MUST do better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LOVE Chipole food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited in line for my turn to wait again on my meat of choice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm still in disbelief about how underweight my chipotle bowl was this evening,For the price of a bowl I expect so much more ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and they drenched my bowl in sour,the meat the cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a veggie burrito bowl for pick up,It was just a dallop of rice,Despite ordering the bowl with beans,and fajitas - none of these items were in my bowl,corn salsa,cheese,and sour cream,There is also no way to call ahead to check if they are out of ingredients because no one ever answers the phone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you use-hoof meat,I know you're not employing master chefs back there but JESUS cut the huge chunks of inedible gristle out of your steaks ,You DO HAVE TO PREP the cheap steak delivered to your restaurants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It most definitely hasn't been that way as Chipotle rice & beans has been my 9 year olds favorite quick service food since she had teeth to chew,I asked when did they raise the price of the sides of white,rice & black,00 for a scoop of rice & beans ,I understand price increases so that's not even the issue,  beans I ordered,quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
low quality food,Ordered four bowls messed up all of them,Staff were very rude and would not make the bowl they missed,Did I pay $11 for one bag of fucking chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What's worse is they are unapologetic and act like it is an inconvenience to them to have to make your food correctly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can't believe this type of customer service with a company like chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,This is definitely my favorite Columbus chipotle location ,Thank you also to chipotle for having vegetarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my wife pissed all over the worker and now im divorced because there were no blinds in this stupid ass chipotle,dont come to this chipotle,and there root beer and coke tastes like legit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been going to this particular chipotle for years ,then when I looked to the back to see is the chicken was cooking they told me they can't cook anymore,One day I showed up at 11:30 (they've been open for about 50 mins that day)   And for some reason they ran out of meat after being open,Just today I went to get a salad ,Overall poor quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff was fine and food was good,Quick in and out like so many other chipotle's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it doesn't matter as long as my food is decent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pretty expensive for a quarter cup of food,I've never seen a chipotle that bad,I got a bowl ,The bowl was equally as bad,Literally a tablespoon maybe of beans,and salad,The salad had 6 small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By the time the food is acquired for delivery it's cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's my food so just do what I tell you,Also where is my sour cream,Show me on this receipt where it says to add corn,It doesn't because I despise corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and being only that far from us our food came cold,I live a mile from this location so this chipotle is my go for a quick,yet they toss a sh*t ton of it on the plate and there was barley any rice or the other,she asked for guacamole ,and they flooded the dish with cheese ,and slapped a wad of sour cream on the meal ,and distasteful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All time favourite food,tasty and yummy food,Every weekend we loved to visit Chipotle for rice bowl,I love their sour cream,salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The workers sort of lazily dump bags of food on the multi-stack,The workers who assemble the food are resentful,I have had to go back to this little hellhole to return food (which I have never done before) because,the $11 burrito is the size of a taco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I paid full price for a burrito just four inches in length ,If you aren't watching them make the burrito you're going to get ripped off,This used to be a decent chipotle ,but you can't trust this chipotle for contactless pickup anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is literally the WORST chipotle,the rice ,and beans are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing is grosser than finding a hair in your burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered my food at 4:00pm for 5:00pm ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chicken was burnt and my daughter's guacamole came out of the burrito because he lady wrapped it too tight,I recently went to the new chipotle in Posner park,I got a chicken bowl with not lettuce,I always get a salad but I couldn't get that because the lettuce was brown ,When I asked the worker to please replace it with fresh lettuce,I was going to get a salad anyway but when she mixed the lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It appears there are multiple complaints with food thru online,Perhaps they are not as particular about the quality of the food ,The chicken in the burrito bowl was too burned to eat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went through the line for my usual bowl,"When I was told there was ""no one to make more fresh salsa ","and no one to make guacamole""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got home and the names on the food didn't match my order,Then I went back to get my actual order and they skimped on the food they actually gave me,Got home and my girlfriend found an avocado skin in her food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
showed up to pick up the food that I've already purchased ,and the customer's in line get their food faster than I do,This chipotle is by far the worst chipotle that I've ever been to,If It wasn't the closest chipotle then I'd never go,This location is very poor in my opinion  and ownership needs to come evaluate this chipotle location,Like a broken record this place is out of steak and rice that you need to wait 15 min for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We go to this location because it's the closest to our house but their food ,The staff just doesn't care how to package and handle our food,our food is disgusting,the food is leaking all over the bag ,I agree with the other comments about the chicken being typically burnt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 There was no wait at Boloco (a few doors down) but let me tell you it is because the food at Chipotle is way better, If you are in a mood for fast mexican food this is the place to go, Ordered my usual chicken beans & rice bowl ,super crispy and gave another layer to my bowl, I almost always order the chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got food poising so bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a burrito here last,I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a chicken burrito on DoorDash with extra,the size of the burrito was a third,brown rice),pinto beans,: cheese and sour cream (along with corn salsa,but what I got was a small amount of cheese ,don't be lured by the queso sauce promotions because it is slightly gritty and gloppy with a taste similar to processed cheese,and barely any sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i said ""I would like a burrito bowl to go",I love chipotle,"with the brown rice"" ","and the lady said ""white or brown rice",she scooped the gauc all over my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the chicken was friggen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Online ordered and had to leave without my food after 30 mins as my order still wasn't ready,The crazy thing is that if I'd queued and ordered my food at the counter I would have been out of there within 5 mins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Karen (I think that's her name) and K were so personable and that I almost forgot that I was ordering food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 stars because the food was tasty,Let's start w/ the food,the food is good,rice,This time I went the chicken was seasoned better than I remember from previous,beans,salsa,Choose your meat, visits overall it tasted pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However despite the veggie error--the food tasted fresh,Overall happy with my food ,One of my three tacos had veggies in it,There was a few veggies crammed on the edge of the bowl--but it didn't look like there was any real effort for the veggies to go inside the tacos where they belong,For the price of these tacos,I have no interest in guacamole but would love like even a 10% off my taco deal or something,I typically have alright experience at this chipotle,I wish that chipotle had more promos going on in their apps,I do expect for each to be filled with the proper ingredients listed,and hope next time the ingredients are more evenly balanced,and was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I'm not slipping on my ass by the drink fountain (if it even has any in it) on spilled soda and wondering what the green oozing juices are laying all over the counter top I'm usually being given bowls when I ask for burritos,and at one point the line worker may as well have rolled my burrito ,and thrown the cashier the burrito assembly,I am talking this burrito was F***ED,It was like I entered an alternate reality and they made the burrito inside out,you just walk in and start making random people burritos for free,I very much enjoy chipotle ,but this chipotle is h,the most hilariously awful chipotle I have ever had the misfortune of walking into,this chipotle is a warzone,Is this like some sort of free market chipotle test,vagabond chipotle,I then asked for brown rice because I knew how ungodly awful,"""  and not only did they give me white rice",lettuce when I ask for chicken,And then they had the audacity to try and ask me if I wanted a BEER when I simply asked for chips ,"""May I also have a large Drink and chips please",No chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I recently ordered chipotle because I got too lit and their food revived me back to life,This chipotle single,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
05 is a small price to pay for a chicken quesadilla,these two crew members who are really good at scooping beans never fail to astound me,They have consistent quality customer service,The taste brings me back to my childhood,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We asked for a burrito with steak ,I know every chipotle follows the same,I got the corn salsa (which isn't typically super,When we asked for fresh steak they told us they would charge us for double,steak which is absolutely ridiculous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""remake my food time"" I would not have ordered",I messaged chipotle telling them what had happened-my,The incompetence is unbelievable at chipotle, tbh chipotle has lost all my respect ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
order had the smallest burrito I've ever seen at a Chipotle ,"after waiting in a line out the door get up to place my order and I'm greeted with ""we're out of black beans & guacamole",got home and realized they forgot my large guacamole ,and they are out of dressing for our salads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I frequently order from this Chipotle location and have never had any issues with the quality and content of my food,Have waited ten minutes in the lane before to pick up pre-ordered food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a long day and I was craving their chips and salsa,I bit into my chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I order through the app and have the food delivered,when I've called to get the issue resolved to get the food delivered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But I just want to take a moment to share that I think this is a great location and I always enjoy the food here,I eat chipotle all the time ,In general everyone knows what you're going to get when you go to chipotle ,Consistently delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food came out 10 min past promised,I finally got my food,I didn't get any rice,and the order was entirely incorrect and the bowl was only half,I ordered double chicken and there was barely any in the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Regardless of the number of stories about food-poisoning, And with the food you serve your patrons,one who still believes the veggie rice bowl to be worth the trip, But what genuinely freaked me out was the size of the avocado skin I pulled out of my guacamole (see photo), Whoever is making your guacamole needs a refresher or just shouldn't be doing it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 So was food,hot food was hot,and cold food was cold, We had chicken bowl & barbacoa bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been waiting 15 minutes for my mobile order of one taco ,and chips scheduled at 2:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited 15 minutes for my bowl to be half-full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I literally had 5 pieces of chicken ,I'm tired of paying extra for guacamole that I never get,and no guacamole on my salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First I got a burrito bowl ,it looked like burrito bowl portioned for child,The woman inconvenienced when I asked for a lid for my bowl,but when I asked them to tap the beans to dry them out a bit she made it seem as if I was asking a major,After that they skimped on all the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have gotten food poisoning from this chipotle,Just go to another chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my burrito today was of the quality that I came to expect ,I've always been a fan of chipotle ,and the hot red salsa was spicier (which is a good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,I found what appeared to be a chunk of meat in my guac,and really made the guy working watch me pick it apart with my bare hands to prove it was meat (he said it was avocado,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Considering food options on President's Holiday,The food was fresh,They do not give as much meat as the local,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a rice bowl + my husband had a burrito,maybe I've been spoiled by taco deli,Turns out i am not a chipotle person,I guess if you like chipotle this one is probably a good,It was entirely edible but all tastes a bit cludgy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is not the first time I had an order delivered to my house from here where they barely filled the bowl especially when I paid extra for them to do so don't think I'll be ordering at least delivery from this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Survey was regarding food poisoning ,but I got and the Barbacoa did not taste right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never have I been served such little rice ,and beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also wish that they had more food for cheaper ,I go to chipotle about once a day like no joke it's my favorite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I am surprised in the 40minutes it took me to get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then got the corn salsa in my bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 She was breathing on the food she was preparing,Covid-19 numbers increasing and she's breathing in food, But there aren't preparing my food, No why I will ever eat here again because it's clear the management doesn't follow proper protocols for food safety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Employee insisted they do not do double wrapped tortilla burritos ,"and then stated they do actually make them but it would ""charge you extra for double wrapped tortilla burritos",""" and hard shell tacos",Trash chipotle location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you're going to work in the food industry that requires good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle FUCKING SUCKS ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was obviously cold,I didn't want to take any chances of someone spitting in my food or drink,This chipotle is horrible,This chipotle literally needs to do something ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
each time they forgot my salad dressing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I ordered through the app two hours ago and have yet to receive my food,From stale to undercooked rice,hard beans,which I'm sure will once again be a salad with no dressing and very minimal toppings even though I pay for double meat,"maybe even a whole 5 pieces of lettuce in a ""salad""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think getting it on the side by itself or pairing it with chips is the way to go,The guacamole costs the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The second worse chipotle in Atlanta,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Chipotle's food,I have mobile ordered roughly 8 times in the past couple months and NEVER have I gotten my food at the pickup time,EDIT: Wrote this review before opening the food from my most recent,Avoid this chipotle if possible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle place ever,When he was 100% that the Wallet was there so he drove to this chipotle after asking the girl again if they had it she stepped away asking her coworker,but then I guess that explains the location of this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I want to hug them all after they make food,that I want to punch you in your burrito making faces,Your cilantro lime rice,black beans,And those damn tortilla chips are so good,and guacamole - all jammed up in flour, And you do make wicked tasty guacamole,lettuce,corn relish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Asked for guacamole on my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love their  vinaigrette dressing and get it every time to put on my bowl,This dressing tasted nothing like Chipotle's vinaigrette,"It was missing its ""tangy"" taste ",and tasted like pure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I literally just watched the Asian lady on shift at 6:15 PM shove a tortilla chip in her mouth 5 feet away from the person making my food,and she started cooking meat on the grill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customer service was good however the quality of the food was horrible,they were not even scooping full size portions in the bowls 1 order had rice that didn't cover the bottom of the bowl,My order of course was at least 1 full scoop of topping but the rice was awful,another probably only had 5 pieces of chicken on it if that,and chicken was barely cut up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and have no idea about the many food safety violations they make on a minute-by-minute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight my son ordered a vegan burrito with Soffits,I went for a steak burrito,Yes my burrito is WAY smaller than his,Both burritos were delicious,One of my kids is vegan and chipotle is his favorite,rice,no rice,black beans,pinto beans,no beans,corn salsa,however I chose less items and did not request double meat,light cheese ,and light sour cream,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This makes me turned off from Chipotle in general which is sad because I love their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I typically love chipotle,I refuse at this point to drive 15 minutes back to chipotle to have them remake it,get home to eat my bowl ,The amount of sour cream and guacamole that was loaded up was disgusting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well I love the food,And unfortunately that's at every chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On my last visit I ordered two bowls with carnitas,The second bowl had about a cup of guacamole ,The meat was mushy like tuna fish and there was a clear liquid that looked like water on the bottom portion of the bowl,tomato salsa ,77) One order had cheese and they forgot to add tomato salsa,and a tablespoon of meat,and guacamole,lettuce,Each time my order was messed up and low quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He didn't close our food either,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worst experience has been going to pick up an app order and having to stand in a mobile order line with a dozen or so other people and wait over 45 minutes from the promised pickup time to get my food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I get up to order and they ran out of rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle's food is always amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I refuse to wait for a parking spot for food as if I were at the mall on Black Friday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If I have a choice I prefer this location over the Woburn location based on friendliness of the team and consistency of the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spectacular guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was good food for the price,If only chips and salsa would come with the food like they do at Moe',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My burrito guy was a plus in his attitude ,My resultant burrito was a fat, White rice or Brown, That helped me to veer away from the pulled beef (I didn't care for the seasonings) and toward the tender pulled pork (the cubes of steak and chicken were a little, When it was clear that I didn't know which meat I wanted, The only thing that had an extra charge was the guacamole, Salsas - tomato based and corn - yes to both,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also killed the white rice with way too much,Don't go here-first time ever that I didn't finish a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I had the steak burrito bowl without any beans, You're looking at about 6 bucks for the burrito/bowl itself , Nice crispy peppers and onions with their cilantro rice are good,chicken, My guilty pleasure are their lime flavored chips,and you can add guac/chips for a small,and I think their ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,and for once a burrito that did not bust open,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burrito maker doesn't overstuff the tortilla such that the burrito bursts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the chef walked out (quit) with food on the grill,The food is great,I really love chipotle, (I mean it is chipotle) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the girl that made my bowl & that rung me up were extremely rude,they had no steak ,and cheese,They didn't even offer to grab more cheese,It's literally just cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito was good,but the chips were a little,and i think it gets enough around-the-clock traffic that they keep the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
decent food ,and a great price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice is usually a hit or miss,The rice is gloppy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was ok,and the food was good,I remember the first time I went I was like this is great(Especiallly the chicken),I had a salad(it was not the greatest),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last time I went the food was terrible,I don't know if it was the rice or the chicken or the salsa I got but the next day I got food poisoning ,I used to love going to chipotle all the time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think it could be a little warmer and a little cleaner and less ""fast-food-y""", Bu the value is excellent if you consider what you are paying for the amount and relative quality of the food,I like the burrito bowl,I like the fact that they have brown rice,I like the cilantro in the rice,although I think the chicken is sometimes a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Over all we enjoyed the salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but somehow that changed over to 'bowl' preference, I go back and fourth between steak and chicken,often combining them because they're both delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I found a random stray of hair in my food,I expect these kinds of restaurants to have high standards of cleanliness when handling food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff were friendly so I didn't feel rushed and the food was fresh,The only reason I'm taking away a star was that my bowl got a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This review isn't really about the food -- if you know Chipotle,then you know the food,then this is a great addition to the mall area food options,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the lady who applied my sour cream gave me way more than it needed, It was a TON of sour cream, Food tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do like that you can get both guac and fajita veggies on your veggie burrito or bowl ,and it's included in the price (their fajita veggies are actually crisp,My main gripe is their chicken is adobo,I just can't come here if I'm craving chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this burrito was built very well,A burrito is obviously more about the compliment of flavors more than just individual,and used a good helping of it on the burrito,I prefer this one out of the recent chain-burrito shops I've eaten at in the last, I am a big fan of the Lime-Cilantro flavored rice too,I happened to luck out with a new vat of rice just being made , The beans are not one click away from being refried bean,IE crisp lettuce,good distribution of ingredients ,and the ingredients seem to be very fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a burrito BOWL usually chicken with guacamole , I dip my chips into my burrito bowl like its a hug bowl of dip,The burritos are okay,and a bag of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the customer service is so meh and the food is always subpar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I took it home and couldn't even eat it because the white rice on my burrito was EXTREMELY salty,but they really messed it up yesterday - I ordered a chicken Burrito to go at their Fenway location ~6:30pm,I wish they had better quality control than that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always good,All in all great food,This time the chips were the grease est I have ever had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They consistently replace food ,And though they're very quick serving food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and excess food on the floor from previous,the back area where they prepare food was unclean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chicken and veggie burritos to be delivered,It was my first time having a burrito ,Take advantage of extra rice (complimentary) ,Burrito bowls are my favorite,salsa ,along with chips,they forgot to mark my guacamole ,and guacamole,seeing as my team ordered steak,although the salad is more low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Chipotle and admit that the ingredients in my burrito were very tasty,But that doesn't matter as much if the burrito is rolled into a softball,The problem with spherical burritos is that you have to guess where to bite,And then the first half of the burrito ends up being a really heavy,bean and rice burrito ,and the second half ends up being a veggie and cheese burrito,This is why proper burrito folding technique is so important,That way ingredients are spread out and the burrito is easier to eat ,I take burrito craftsmanship very seriously,Use the sides of the tortilla to spread the ingredients to either side,and ingredients don't fall out as easily,Individual ingredients: A+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will never get chicken in my food here ,I like the veggie burrito ,but the veggie burrito was quite nice,but the chicken pieces are loaded with gristle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really good veggie burritos with a bunch of stuff on them, I believe the burrito was 6ish dollars ,and the chips with salsa was about a buck fifty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but as far as the food ,Not sure the poor ratings for this chipotle location,and service it is the best chipotle I have ever been to (,Living near many closer chipotle options I still find myself going out of the way to visit this one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vegetarian-friendly burritos,Great for a large lunch/dinner and you'll always get the same good quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the Fresh Tex Mex food this place has to offer,They are great fresh food,salads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tasty food,the food temperature to be lukewarm,the prices a bit on the high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They didn't have burritos in front so they left me to go grab more,my burrito was the worst I have ever had,It was soggy and ripped and I basically had to eat it like a bowl,They hardly gave me any chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Andrew the manager was so sweet let me in at last minute and prepared my food thank you sooooo much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For not only skimping on the contents of my burrito bowl,but then failing to securely close said burrito bowl before bagging it,Cut to beans ,and salsa soaking through the brown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
many people are just picking up food,My favorite is a chicken burrito bowl w/ chips ,I like to shake the bowl ,and guacamole on the side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I f I owned the store I would be concerned about the food quality ,25 soft shell taco ,25 taco, Also meat was tough,Guy sitting next to me was spiting out tough meat on his plate as was I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is like a burrito-making machine,But the workers form what is essentially a burrito assembly line - one worker adds your choice of rice,You've got a delicious burrito ready,I haven't found a better burrito in Boston to date,beans,the next worker adds salsa,and meat,cheese,and sour cream,but I find it difficult to care much about that when what they do have to offer is so flavorful and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
) Then you turn to see the food line ,It's broken down into the basic Mexican food categories (burritos,For the sized burrito I got,which felt slightly bigger than a Moe's burrito,I couldn't have asked for a better tasting burrito,tacos,And for the price ,salsa (Moe's pico),guacamole (extra,Such a noticeable difference in the freshness of these ingredients,The taste was VERY refreshing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They let me have a taste of the new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of the food just wasn't the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 This is like a subway for burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food has never disagreed with us before,The burritos were sloppily made ,and the amount of guacamole ,and sour cream used was ridiculous,Yet they gave ma a hard time about extra corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm a big fan of chipotle,Not sure but I feel the quality of ingredients should be improved ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I decided to treat myself to a Chipotle burrito,I ordered a chicken and pork burrito,The kid puts the rice beans and chicken on the burrito ,so he takes half the chicken off the burrito ,and throws it in the garbage and puts the pork on the burrito,That is the last Chipotle burrito I will ever eat,and I answer it was chicken ,He goes half and half or double meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was terrible,I have been to chipotle on numerous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who needs a burrito ,when you have a burrito bowl, Ever since I was introduced to this place I've literally abandoned burritos,at checkout the cashier comped one of my burrito bowls ,The explosion of cilantro lime rice,chicken or steak,beans,salsa,and the chips are out of this world,and chips,guacamole,The last time I visited this location they were out of guacamole, Since I love guacamole they scraped the pan ,shredded cheese ,and sour cream is amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instead of throwing away food that l,ands on the counter they pick it up and throw it back into the food,I can see why chipotle makes people sick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place is close to where I live so it's most convenient but I'd rather drive to another chipotle than eat here,Last time my carry out order they FORGOT TO PUT MEAT AND SALSA  how do you forget to put meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food taste very bl,I don't mind waiting if it's delicious ,I think bc they are so busy the focus on quantity over quality here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because chipotle's food is not at fault at all,Their steak was cooked perfectly and overall the food was very consistent,burritos were well made ,the line itself is overcrowded too as most other chipotles' function best with two people or three max on the burrito line,It was my favorite in Columbus and just a walk around the corner,And just recently they opened late and were missing several key ingredients, in quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is the same, vegetarian burritos , Somehow they've managed to solve the one issue that immediately pops to mind when you think about getting a burrito at Chipotle,The prices are the same,and bowls you've come to expect at every Chipotle, tasty chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that they definitely had a light hand on my burrito bowl,not only do i LOVE chipotle,never in a million years did i think i'd have to complain about portion size at chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This particular location has a wide variation in the flavor and quality of their food from week to week,) and are unwilling to make more depending on how close it is to closing time (I frequent chipotle most often within 30 minutes of closing time,rice,and they often run out of ingredients (chicken,but other stores happily make a batch of whatever ingredient you want),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Little employee girl behind the counter argued the daylights out of how much guac goes on a vege bowl,"every single Chipotle we've ever been to considers the guac the ""meat"" of the vege bowl",I watched the big piles of animal flesh getting dumped into the bowls ,but the guy dipping the guac put the tiniest little spoon of guac on both our vege bowls,I explained how all Chipotle's have ever been with vege bowls ,the Saint Cloud Chipotle completely forgot the guac on all 3 vege bowls takeout last,When you compare the big piles of meat to the little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm biased because there is a kick ass burrito place (Zia Taqueria) set up similar,meat filled burrito kind of girl,(And their free burrito day is pretty great,beans,salsa,Their chips are great,meat,Their salads are my favorite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the chips were seemingly a bit stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chipotle hot,The quac ingredients weren't chopped up enough leaving big,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went the other day and they put such a small portion of chicken on my bowl it might as well have been vegetarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
while the Kingsdale location usually provides under par food also,Still have not even my food,Today was the third time that I do not have the dressing for my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bowl is a ton of food & it's in a perfect,All fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quite simply the worst run chipotle in existence,I live in Grandview and you come to expect a certain standard from businesses here - this chipotle is as bad,For the $$ chipotle brings in managers should be paid 100k annually ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love chipotle yet this location needs help,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I come here all the time and love not only the food ,I love the burrito bowl ,They have brown rice now which I love,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 This location certainly had the same quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let's start with the fact that Chipotle raises their prices at a few,I chose this location over Kirkman due to convenience I have t been to the Kirkman location in awhile hoping their prices haven't changed too ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was solidly impressed with the food here,Amazing food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Each time they give me smaller and smaller portions and it's SO FRUSTRATING because all I want is some extra corn in my burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We enjoy the Mexican food here,It's fresh and reasonably price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good options for kids and the chips are the best,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your typical chipotle, They are generous if you ask for extra salsa or rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the employee took food out of it ,one of the employees handling my food was chewing bubble,when wrapping my burrito,I'm paying for that don't throw a fourth of my burrito away please,Worst chipotle I've been to,For several reasons I was incredibly disappointed with this chipotle,the guacamole was horrible,the lettuce was brown ,and clearly tasted old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can't believe I'm complaining about the chips but since the order was to go I added lime to my bowl,and chips weren't salty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is my go to place for any sort of burrito/taco,Only thing that occasionally gets me mad is when there is a lot of fat left on the meat,I've had times I had to spit out or throw out 1/3 the meat in my meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I come here my burrito is always looking right,My burrito maker couldn't wrap my burrito which was fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The tofu bowl with the tortilla on the side is always the way to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The vegetables and meat are fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
More than once I received a burrito about the size of a hot,I also received a couple busted burritos,only because a tiny/busted Chipotle burrito is still delicious,Is the labor market really that strong that Chipotle can't find someone to make me a proper burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 One of the girl that scoop the foods was like hurry up ,The food runs low,4 dollars worth of steak in a small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't to rice,I have stopped eating here due to ordering vegetarian and arguing of the amount of veggies in the bowl,cheese and salsa,lettuce,All I wanted is to taste the veggies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
About the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They actually tried to pass off my soft taco with 4 cubes of chicken,just not a chipotle I'm used to seeing,"Very ""chincey"" on the ingredients to say the least",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they had time to make her food so she could go eat in the middle of the rush,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to the fact that this same guy forgot to put lettuce in my burrito,to the chubby 21 year old that tried to hit on the girl two people ahead of me by offering her extra chicken on the house,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is consistently subpar for Chipotle, I always somehow get large chunks of burnt unidentifiable ick in my food,brown rice,1/8 cup of rice, Once I got a giant piece of bone in my chicken that almost chipped my tooth, This time I ordered a salad with chicken,black beans ,NO black beans ,and assorted salsas ,and a bag of chips with salsa, The chips are always dry,NO and my chips were chip your tooth, I got all of a 1/4 cup of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also pricey for the portions ,especially for those who want a salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is the best location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I use to like this chipotle location until a horrible,manager started nickel and dime you for extra rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  There is such a variety in meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was okay, the brown rice looked almost grey in color, just okay especially after I ate around the rice,make better rice , The shredded cheese was stuck together in a clump,and declump the cheese,  The taste was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have the best fast-food burritos around,In the battle of Boston burrito supremacy,no brown rice or whole,juicy meats bursting with flavor--what more can you ask for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
instead - it's worth the extra miles and the extra minutes to get really good food , All of those are GREAT - the burritos are good, My first burrito was made with a tortilla that had a vaguely plasticky,my boyfriend got a chicken burrito that was kind of, Not much chicken to be found in there,the tortilla chips are fresh,the chips , The chips were undercooked,the guacamole is heaven in a tiny,and guacamole were seriously flawed,and the guacamole cup was only half-full,that's pretty unacceptable since the serving size is usually pretty conservative to begin with and the guacamole by itself costs $1, taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reasonably-priced burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very seldom can you go wrong with chipotle,lol sometimes I get a really good bowl & today was one of those days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Before I get started on their burritos which everyone seems to hate, Now for the burrito, But making a burrito is an art,so if you don't know how to properly put the right ingredients together then of course your going to have a sh*tty burrito, I recommend getting a side of the really red hot sauce/salsa and eating it with the burrito, This burrito with chips ,  Get it with rice,black beans,salsa,regular salsa, Really fresh Guac and the chips are fresh,and a little bit of sour cream,lettuce,and corn, Very delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burritos,O burrito é,Vc escolhe o tipo de comida (tacos,etc) e vai pedindo os ingredientes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burritos are huge,I have had a few incidents at this location with the burrito being put together poorly,I suggest the Veggie Burrito and the tomato and corn salsa combo,All the ingredients are fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd always suggest the chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,so I don't need to comment on my love for Chipotle deliciousness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been a fan of chipotle forever (,when I lived in Florida and Bostonians didn't even know what chipotle is,Fresh rice,fresh gloves and cheese ,and lettuce from the back--all done with a smile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband and I usually order one rice bowl at night since the amount of food is a lot by asking extra,rice ,and extra chicken (for an addition of $2,All the Chipotle we have gone usually give one spoon of chicken for st,andard or one and a half spoons of chicken if you want extra,The standard amount of chicken is a half of spoon,If you ask extra chicken,This Chipotle is really stingy on meat,This place was different in amount of meat they gave,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
friendly and the food actually has flavor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can go somewhere else for better food ,they put a lot of rice ,salty rice ,The chicken was chewy,"I even told the lady that the chicken was chewy & she responded "" that's how it is "" ",This place is stingy with the meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's 7:50 and still no food,I could have waited in line and could have eaten my food by now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
super friendly and they NEVER scrimp on the food,In other locations you practically have to beg for a decent amount of certain ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Honestly if you have shitty choices for ""Mexican"" food",Ahhh free food,"lettuce) to look as ""authentic"" as Chipotle burritos",you're an asshole to complain about free burritos if all you need to do is wait in line,hella phizZzat burrito, Girthy burrito,and Chipotle's burrito promotion was just the answer to my bitterness, I did appreciate that this burrito has FLAVOR compared to competitors' burritos, I hecka miss California taco trucks,rice,and I realized I can eat chicken or pork so long as they are not barbecued (the preservatives in anatomy, I asked dude if I can mix up the chicken ,beans,I asked the line cook what meat I should get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff in this store along w food are super,1st visit ever to a chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because the food is really tasty,but their burritos were equally good,I especially like the beef burrito,salsa,Chipotle's chips were not quite as lite,Mexican cheese ,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We both had burrito bowls ,they have the basics (rice,The rice choices were white,2 Burrito bowls,beans, or brown cilantro-lime and bean choices were pinto or black beans,I was very disappointed that chips & salsa were not included with an entree,95 for a small amount of chips and a 4 oz cup of salsa (we chose medium),small salsa of side of guacamole,They have 4 salsas - mild,30 for a second small amount of chips,and wanted chips with them,2 sm sides of chips,The meats we tried were the barbacoa (shredded,They were both very tender and flavorful high quality meats,We also got a side (4 oz cup) of guacamole for $1,sour cream and for an extra charge - guacamole) , beef) and steak,there is no cheese dip on the menu,cheese,roasted corn,I was surprised by how few ingredient choices there were,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You'll get an awesome burrito or tacos,I love the fact they don't charge me extra for extra sour cream and cheese,The ingredients are always so fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They always have a smile no matter how busy and the food has yet to be anything less than stellar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 This is Mexican food right,Dried out grizzle is what I was given both times and clearly only one person in the whole store actually knows how to roll a burrito, The rice is bland as well as the burrito , If I'm going for burritos this won't be my first, Chipotle claims to have higher quality ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is by far the worst managed chipotle in Ohio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is AMAZING,The service is so sweet and the serving sizes were generous and not frugal at All BCE #bestChipotleEVER the chips made fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is over 7 years and the service and food presentation have rapidly declined,but they slap the food in the plates like cafeteria workers,There is no pride in how they handle your food,they don't clean the counters off when food falls while their serving you,As a place that supposedly prides itself on the high quality of food they serve,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the worst chipotle I've ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
:) Fresh food - tortilla is soft,chicken is well seasoned,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food bits,as the food is out on display for customers to see,The new staff does not hold their establishment up to the chipotle st,In my experience working for chipotle,I went in to grab a bowl for a late,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my hubby and my son are out so me and my daughter deserve some good food,I love this food,I always have the chicken bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80 on a $6 menu item is pricey,Their chicken is spicier than most of their competition -- ,My only wish: that guacamole was cheaper (or I could sub it in for two or three other,ingredients),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my bowl here was pretty much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chicken burrito bowl with brown, rice ,and salsa is always a win,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and that's before we even have ate the food, The food still tastes great,My wife and I have been going to this chipotle location for over 4 years now ,and probably to chipotle less overall, They are always rushing us through our order and have been going so fast several times that they just put the wrong toppings on our bowls, Not sure why we need to get served this way but it continues everytime and leaves us with a sour taste in our mouths upon leaving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I want a burrito,she's wrapping up the burrito,With the price of a chicken burrito/bowl up $,I first forgot about the burrito being double,My first time wrapping a burrito in a legitimate,I could have done with the chicken being a little,the tortilla has torn thanks to the liquid left from the chicken,She barely gave me a chance to say what I wanted regarding sour cream and cheese,And then I asked for lettuce,I was given the smallest bit of lettuce I have ever seen,SERIOUSLY it's lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I think the price is pretty reasonable (although it can get pricey fast if you get a burrito,chips, My favorite meat is the Carnitas, I also think their guacamole is very yummy,guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm just sitting here and looking around floor and the carpets so dirty I can't wait the new chipotle open the one on the peachtree,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whether it is salsa,meat,lettuce,I understand near closing time you might run out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is way way better than any other burrito place I ever been to,The mild salsa is the best tasting salsa I have ever had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice people and decent food,I've been a little disappointed with some of the burritos I've received, Somehow my burritos end up either grossly over-stuffed, They offer brown rice (which I love,they forgot something and used the wrong rice,I consider Chipotle to be in the upper echelon of 5-ingredient takeout restaurants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your chips were fantastic,I say this because the quality of your chips vary from location to location depending on whose job it is to cook them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The one running the register or someone in the food line is usually new,This location consistently is the slowest operating chipotle that I know,There is zero unity and the place seems like chaos when i ask for Brown rice ,I did call and complain and was offered a new bowl ,And luckily for me i received undercooked chicken,and black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is made better there anyway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bigger problem for this location is not the wait for food,As for the food,If you are looking for a quick in and quick out with burrito in hand,"waiting for a ""I'd rather not count how many calories"" - burrito is not uncommon",I really like chipotle),I'd say it meets chipotle st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as my chicken fajita bowl was quite adequately filled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food area was much the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
y burrito was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He was at the end of the food line,S over all food was good,I absolutely love chipotle,but the guacamole was brown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food, Usually get a beef burrito any time,love even adding the salted chips and salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice was hard,I ordered a steak bowl,they forgot the sour cream and my corn salsa was frozen, This was not even salsa it was a container of FROZEN corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the chicken here is almost like jerky ""dried grizzle""","the music is so loud that the guy in front of me was literally yelling ""steak"" and the lady gave him chicken",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I order a bowl with white rice,The rice is always cooked properly as is the chicken,chicken,medium salsa,and cheese,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only time you actually get a decent sized serving of meat ,and guacamole now a days Is if you are lucky,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is amazing,love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" They know they make burritos right",they had forgotten to put my burrito in the bag,"and was greeted at the counter with"" sorry we ran out of chicken",they yelled out to the long line that they had run out of cheese and guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have great food ,but customer lady who did our bowls sucked I notice she was putting big,potion in everyone bowls as soon as she got to our it was a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff at Buckhead chipotle are champs- but quality/portion of food depends on time of day,I always get a burrito bowl , Sadly this chipotle is all over the place,and condiments are top notch (by chipotle st,Considering the chipotle is located at an intersection,and the white  rice is rarely cooked to perfection,their black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted good,I feel like I should've gotten my extra meat for free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" they sarcastically dumo triple the normal amouny on your food",My bowl was basically sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they'll double-wrap your burrito,Carnitas are my favorite and kudos to them for offering brown rice,They're salsas are also amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5/5 stars as far as tasty fast food and burritos goes, Same with the burritos, It was about 1/3 the size of the normal burritos you get at Chipotle,I don't need a whole burrito normally, If you're going to give me 1/3 of a burrito then charge me 1/3 of the price,but halving my burrito each time is going to continue to annoy me,and half a scoop of rice,a pinch of salsa, They have filled up my guacamole to only half full,tonight the lady literally put a pinch of cheese,and the quality is up to Chipotle st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
extra white rice,with a hint of black beans,tomato salsa,tomatillo red chili salsa, I took this order to go and ordered additional chips with queso,and cheese,sour cream,corn,literally a perfect blend of taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My friend asked for a quesadilla and he gave him a burrito,Love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 If you want some good burritos,salad bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A bit on the pricey,Food quality is very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customer service is important and just because everyone loves Chipotle does not mean they only love the food,However the food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is probably my favorite chain burrito joint,which has a woefully inadequate selection of reasonably priced places to eat within a short, I do wish they'd throw in some free chips like Moe's though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They never skip on toppings and they are always very quick and never out of food,The staff is friendly and I'm glad I live around the corner from this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She rolled her eyes at me as I asked for a bit more hot sauce so I could actually taste it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm from out of town and went to this location for dinner and the food prep,Not what I want from someone handling my food,Bad employees and gross food,then proceeded to go behind the counter to finish my burrito,Lu ended up asking someone else to make me a quesidilla and even that was bad with the cheese not melted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I used to love chipotle food ,but the last three times the food is really bad,Will never get chipotle anymore ,chewy meat ,the meat was not only chewy ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get a burrito bowl ,Unbelievable- We now choose to go to the chipotle in UA or on main,Chipotle is a place I go when I'm hungry as HELL- head to the chipotle on 5th if you're craving a light,The guacamole is the worst-,and she politely asked for more guacamole ,and the woman (who is notorious for the skimpy portions in particular) told her she'd have to charge her for guacamole twice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food has never lost its quality,I always get a burrito bowl with chips ,or chicken,This Chipotle in particular gets pretty dang busy (night and day compared to the Pearl St one) but that's because it's in a college town and so delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food at Chipotle is always very good,I have been to many chipotles over the years ,But this place wins the price for worst service/longest line/slowest employees,Never tasted a bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been having a bad day and the food was okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is located in the 29th St Mal,but everything else was delicious as always,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I stand in the traditionally long chipotle line (not an issue) just to pay for my salad,and be told that they are out of salad dressing,"and I was told to ""have a nice day"" with my dressingless salad",As disappointing as it is to run out of items it happens but to have it followed up by a nonchalant it's your fault for ordering a salad attitude adds insult to injury, And to have salad dressing shoved in My h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Inside is welcoming and I like that the dining room is located pretty far away from where they prepare food,I especially like how they season their meat because it adds a delicious,I admire Chipotle for the efforts they make toward serving fresh and organic ingredients, taste that you can't get any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is fresh,I'm not going to go into the wonderful benefits on the fresh food marketing approach Chipotle has with which chicken they pick,I've ran into too much dry food at places like Moe's,rice,I get the chicken salad bowl with onions,such as chips ,corn,and delicious,but I've only ran into the delicious juiciness that is Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is always perfect,Chipotle it's just delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food ,Not 5 stars because I think you should get more food for the money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and tend to be a little flavorless (the rice is just rice,The ingredients just don't seem as fresh,but it's really a quality versus quantity thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the actual food bar always looks clean,If you like Chipotle food than its what your looking for, so I still  go here for my burrito fix,Also there was one time where I saw one of the workers grab some spilled chicken from the beef pan and put it into my burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the food will not kill you,If you want fast Tex Mex with high quality and fresh ingredients you will like Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We needed a huge quantity of burritos made for our staff of 40 people ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They forgot to put black beans in my burrito bowl,No legumes in my burrito bowl,( and forgot my beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Normally love Chipotle but been at the Colonial location and this is the second time the food was below expections ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they skimped on the meat for my bowl, The ingredients were fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so there were mistakes being made or almost made even though I was standing right there politely putting my burrito together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is on par with other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All the servers were really sloppy with the food,I usually don't complain about too much food ,to the point where you could've made a couple burritos by what was on their counter,With being sloppy they over used all their ingredients so the burrito couldn't get rolled ,but the excess sour cream made my meal feel kinda like a hybrid smoothie burrito,and the bowls would instantly spill over ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh and yes please rewrap since you busted a hole in the side of the smallest burrito known to man,This is by far the worst chipotle on the planet, Want chicken,beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can make a damn burrito from scratch in the time it takes them to put together burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because WOW was my burrito huge,maybe it was because I didn't get meat on my burrito this time,but I felt it to be less spicy than most burritos I've had at Chipotle,The chips,:) The chips were just a hair on the stale,Maybe all of their spice is in the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food taste fresh,My usual - rice bowl with barbacoa,**TIP - Ask for extra of (almost) any of the ingredients (rice,black beans,beans,tomato salsa,corn salsa,salsa,The only things that they charge for is extra meat or guac,cheese ,sour cream,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Smallest burrito I have ever had,Oh and the small burrito was ripped ,Worst chipotle experience I've ever had,I don't like complaining and chipotle is glorious,The guy was basically counting the rice ,and chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was wrapped up tight like a burrito,it looked like one giant open burrito,I guess next time I order tacos I will ask them to wrap each individual,all three tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have never seen a chipotle so empty,The rice was mush ,and the chicken was poorly seasoned,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is known for its burritos , Among them are better tasting burritos ,Chipotle's burritos are still priced competitively, I do think Moe's and Willy's burritos are big,I think Moe's burritos are too big, Like the other burrito joints, You can pick and choose the ingredients go into your burrito,burrito bowl, I usually spring for a burrito or burrito bowl, Burrito bowls are exactly like burritos except without the tortilla,The burrito tortillas are made of flour,tacos, Same ingredients and same price,Different rice , Brown rice is there for those who want to eat healthy,and chicken are sourced from farms that naturally raise their livestock , I think the pinto beans,taste better than the black beans,and chips and I'm a fan of their salsa bar, Nothing the red chili salsa can't fix,chips cost extra, The chips at Moe's , Despite the higher quality meats, My favorite meats are steak,you can get extra meat, The steak ,or salad,Chipotle is fine and I like their use of all-natural ingredients,the kitchen and ingredients are laid out before the customers in an assembly-line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He made me feel as if I was begging for food,I love Chipotle but the guy that created my bowl was so stingy,and salsa as I want,For $8 I should be able to have as much lettuce,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meat and rice are not cold like last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They didn't listen to my actual order at all and gave me the wrong food,AND to top it all off they burnt my food because they FORGOT it was in there,This is by far the worst chipotle customer service I have ever received,Is the address of this specific chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
last night I got a chicken burrito ,My boyfriend got a veggie burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Food is always good and the food is cooked in plain, He droped some food on the floor ,he wiped his sweat and nose with the same gloves he had on and started handeling the food without changing gloves,The manager appeard to do nothing and they kept serving the contaminated food to other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've gone 3 times in the last month and was extremely pissed at my food two of those times,My coworkers agree we would rather eat hospital food than be disappointed by this specific,Legit the amount of lettuce was the amount hey put in the burrito,the lettuce is usually pretty gross looking which I guess people don't care about when it's going inside their burritos,I'm not getting rice or a tortilla on my salad so you need to put a LITTLE more lettuce on a salad,no lettuce,Who makes a salad with like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
since I love spicy food,It's not my favorite assembly-line-burrito place,although it seems like every time I come here my burrito ends up being spicy,NO other assembly-line-burrito place does that,It also mostly justifies the slightly higher price (the ingredients seem to be of fairly high,boo on paying for chips/salsa,The chips and salsa are pretty, quality as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We ordered chipotle today for lunch,When the meal was delivered it was COVERED in beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ColumBEST Burrito: cilantro-lime rice,fair price,black beans,adobo-marinated grilled steak,fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they do skimp on the condiments such as sour cream ,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My favorite chipotle so far,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pay for the double chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Staff was effective and cool (even to this old guy writing)  food was super, fresh and the quality was shockingly good,I'm a convert for this high quality fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is okay other,I am huge on a clean eating experience and prefer not to have the remnants of other people's food in sight or on my arms,than the obvious fun Chipotle staff seems to have pouring on loads of sour cream but stingy on $2 guacamole,I managed to grab a corner of a table without crumbs since I am so hungry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Mexican food ,and especially love burritos,responsibly sourced burritos,the burritos were lacking in originality,The chicken was dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and providing nothing short of exemplary food ,and one of you gets a normal burrito,and the other has like the half grown brother of that first burrito with far less ingredients ,he barely even bothered to get all the burrito contents off the old,our team should be more than happy to wrap the burrito in a new,my boyfriend ordered two chicken burritos for the two of us since we both like the same,He then goes to throw this second burrito away despite already being told it was fine,yet another badly wrapped burrito,There were pieces of chicken in my burrito that were rubbery compared to others ,The one bit of difference was that I wanted hot salsa though,""" and the guy puts hot salsa on both ",despite the fact this should always be a mutual relationship of delicious love,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am fighting through a burrito induced haze to write this review so pardon,burritos (yeah,They will be slinging burritos faster than you could imagine,you can customize one of about four menu options: tacos,You then have an assembly line of taco-related items to pile onto whatever monstrous,rice bowls or salads (boo,the meats are good,They taste weird or extra-salty at some Chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even when the food isn't as good,and freshly prepared burrito head here,one time they were out of chicken completely which was kind of a bummer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And then asked for sour cream on the side ,and get home and there is no sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito was just as delicious,Went here today and they added brown rice,with brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't even heat burrito, They still have the best guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but why get a burrito if it isn't going to be spicy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst of all: the bathroom has a padlock on it that can only be opened after you buy food,We wanted to wash up before eating but instead had to get all of our food,Asked for salsa ,paid for lg chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I won't make a habit of it due to the prices, My only complaint is paying such a ridiculous amount for chips and not even a reasonably sized cup of salsa,Overall the quality seemed reasonable,tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fresh food,The food here is very good, Just head to the cash register and collect your food, I recommend the veggie burrito with peppers/onions, Add guacamole because it comes free on the veggie burritos,brown rice,black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like to order their vegetable bowls ,and ask for all the salsas to jazz things up,and it's good quality meat (the beef is a little,If I were eating meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only is the food great,She was great and told me every detail when I was paying for my food,I went to purchase a burrito last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You guys are always 110% the food is always awesome,Dear chipotle,cooks and managers that make this chipotle the ABSOLUTE BEST chipotle on earth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I'm the type that needs a bottle to myself so I can drench every bite of my burrito with smoked, At other chipotle locations,they have brown rice here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their work station is always very messy and they put no care in to the quality of the food their serving,This is the closest chipotle to me so I probably have to keep going ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not much different from Anna's or Boca Grande or any other burrito chain in Boston,Like most other fast food burritos,The prices are good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unbelievably unprofessional employee behind the counter responsible for handling clients food,Someone this blatantly ignorant should NOT be handling food for the public,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every single table had remnants of food still on them from previous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It is disappointing that you can't get nutritional information for their food on the website,inexpensive food that is quite tasty,I enjoy Chipotle burritos, I've read a few other reviewers comment on the number of calories in a burrito, I usually get the chicken burrito ,you can eat half the burrito for dinner , The chicken burrito is $5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In October 2012 I got food poisoning here ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best burrito I've ever had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always loved the food at chipotle ,I hardly choose 4 items for my veggie bowl ,and normally ask for more lettuce or salsa which I see them h,quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Didn't say anything more than asked the rest of the line if they wanted chicken ,the steak is ready and they are serving the chicken people along with the steak people who had been waiting longer,They asked what kind of meat I wanted,then they are out of steak,told them steak,I was placed to the side with my fellow steak eaters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Any chipotle anywhere,Great salsa and corn brown rice plus some chips,Carnitas in a bowl,And quality that brings you back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
be given quality food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one was a burrito instead of bowl,one they forgot meat,one had corn and sour cream added,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" All they said was ""rice",beans,and stale chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
barbacoa and then steak for dinner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Skimpiest servings of food I have ever seen (""can I have peppers",but when I do I want a heaping bowl of comfort,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a simple sofritas burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A place with bad food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(free food)  they are pretty, pricey ,but delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just don't try and help whoever is making your burrito by pointing ,and extending your arm over the glass barriers- you'll be admonished and when she subsequently gets the burrito wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first time I ordered in and watched my food being prepared,Perhaps it was because I wasn't present to see my food prepared,burritos all flour ,and rice with no substance,gristly meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you always provide me with lots of food that doesn't really hurt my conscience,the only reason why that i'm reviewing chipotle is that they have BROWN RICE HERE,good ol' chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wayyyyy too big to eat burrito,Sidenote: i have been to a few different Chipotle's in Atlanta but this one makes their corn salsa a lil,delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two words ( STEAK BURRITO) awesome food great,price fast service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality is horrible,and my food always taste stale,Today I saw a guy change out a trash bag and then touch the food,It's really disappointing because the location of this chipotle is so convenient,This location has officially left a bad taste in my mouth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" So I went to the counter and showed the girl and ask her if she could give me the so more guacamole  this 4""2 little guy Jose told her to ignore me because there was a line I was really pissed I love chipotle ",but I hate this location also what's up with the steak being so raw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yummy burrito bowls make low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
T- is for the tasty morsels now stuck in my teeth or the food that has dropped into my lap,C - is for the chicken or steak that graces my burrito,guacamole that is graciously lumped onto my burrito,the burrito is huge,but I like to a combo of mild and medium salsa,sour cream ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff was super kmowledgeable about what stuff was gluten free (the majority of the menu) and they knew how to prep the food in a manner that would not be a problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I had a chicken burrito on my last,rice, Everything is fresh and they grill the meat for their offerings right in front of your eyes,medium spicy sauce and guacamole, I added cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle has excellent food at a great,tastier place to have Mexican-fusion food in Atlanta, Their burritos are top,their burrito bowls even better ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this place got me sick with food poisoning twice,how can you mess up a chicken taco,well this chipotle did,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
brown rice,I usually get the sofritas bowl,I decided to order a Margarita with my bowl,both beans,salsa,cheese,sour cream,corn,and she walks away to get more corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and my veggie burrito was excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They apparently forgot about my order and the cashier comes back after checking in the back while chewing food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ingredients fast-foody ,Gone here many a time for lack of a better burrito place within vicinity ,Given the choice between Chipotle and the random burrito st,Chipotle consistently provides a burrito superior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My bf and I lovveee chipotle ,and we've never had an issue but today we got the last of steak which was dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They forgot my guacamole,They know me as the girl who likes ALOT of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service is slow and the food is always made sloppily,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reasonable food prices ,burrito,You build your own bowl,salad amazing ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stale chips is a common,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get the soup & side salad or 1 taco & side salad - it used to be on the menu ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While I am still not totally won over by the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I brought the food back ,I was just really disappointed that my son could not eat his food ,I was charged for 2 kids tacos,not a taco ,I told her that it was wrong and she said that all kids meals were the same price,so they traded it out for chicken, The chicken was just as spicy,and only ate chips ,I have learned the hard way not to take kids to this place unless they like really spicy meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place has the best burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is my first time to have a burrito with rice,The corn ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95 you can get enough food for almost 2 meals,And the food is a million times healthier ,I wish I would have been the creator of chipotle,Chipotle constantly delivers a great product for an even better price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you will get good food,the food will almost be guaranteed to suck as it will be old, The food always tastes different,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is high, My biggest thing is that I wish they offered more options is burrito wraps,and I can always get it in a bowl, quality,but what they do have is high quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bowl is good and the burrito is huge,Its quick and the meats are moist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Found hair in the food ,And the tofu looks like dog food,They look at you like you are an idiot if you ask which salsa is spicier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 There have been several times I have ordered a burrito here , There was one instance where I had what seemed to be uncooked corn in my burrito,and the corn salsa was still frozen, or parts of the steak tendon's that should have been cut out ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is my favorite chipotle, Of course the ingredients are always fresh but that's a chipotle st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not asking for a HEAPING pile of food,But the WORST thing I've experienced now is COLD food,I'm not talking lukewarm food that happens in the 5 minute drive back to my house,I'm talking FROZEN chunks of pork in my food ,but if I'm paying $10 for a burrito bowl,It used to be that one burrito bowl would last,I've been coming to this chipotle for years ,So I think it's safe to say I'm giving up on chipotle before I end up in a hospital,and cold rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the HUGE burritos,I love that chipotle gives you a real,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I'm paying for double meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delicious bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the service is nice and the food is good, I just wish the tables were cleaned more often because I've had a hard time in the past finding a table without bits of food on it,This is a pretty good chipotle,But at the end of the day I guess it's just like all the other chipotles out there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Either they are way over authentic and they lack the knowledge in cooking or You get taco Bell ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My thoughts on Chipotle in general is that the burrito is good, The burritos are quite messy,- it is very exciting when it is free burrito day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm writing to let other customers know to be wary of this location as there could be any number of reasons why there would be a fly (not usually found in the middle of a wintery spring season) found in the food,we were horrified to get our take out dinner home and find a fly in our veggie bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whole and healthy food, She introduced me to the yummy burritos , I love the burritos ,but have recently taken a great appreciation for the burrito bowls - ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Our food was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food prepared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I recently picked up the bad habit of adding more sour cream to my burrito,) burrito,After paying for my burrito ,my steak burrito was as delicious,and awesome steak burrito,I ordered my usual - a Steak Burrito with plain white rice (absolutely no cilantro for me),if you want plain white rice,just request it and they get you some from their container of cooked rice waiting to be mixed, The only thing that could have made it better was if there was more steak and less white rice (they put SO much in it,pinto beans,red-chili salsa,cheese,sour cream,)  I also asked for some sour cream in a separate,and lettuce,we decided this would be the perfect spot for a quick but delicious dinner,but it's just so delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were a little skimpy on preparing my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been to chipotle many times and I was always pleased with the food ,I wonder if it is only the Burlington Chipotle or if all restaurants are cutting on the food portions,Today I bought  2 burrito bowls ,I have never seen chipotle serve so small,My 2 kids are still hungry and usually they don't finish the bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
guacamole a lot of days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a burrito,just heard another obnoxious comment from the employee folding the burritos,"""the burrito exploded on this end",unless chewy cold cubed meat is your forte,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am not a fan of Mexican food, I love chipotle,This particular location didnt get the recipe for the rice, The guacamole is amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I thought it was light fare as a burrito can be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We were feeding 15 hungry college students and Chipotle wowed all of us with the quality and quantity of food, I love the lime flavor in the chips,Everything tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wish they had a smaller burrito option other, I normally order a bowl and then ask for a couple of corn tortillas on the side to make my own soft corn tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is darn near impossible in a burrito shop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went by there today and tried a bowl with nothing but rice ,charged full price ,and even had to stop eating my chips ,when I saw the prep guy eating while baking chips,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoy the fact that qdoba has some different burrito options as well as grilled veggies (big,One problem I tend to have with these types of burrito places is that by the time I get to the last,quarter of the burrito,I don't enjoy having my burrito fall apart in my h,I've never understood the hype surrounding chipotle,prices are reasonable,I got the Tofu bowl to avoid potential, Not sure if it's from the meat or the pico,the quality is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well like others have said this review is more about the place and service more than the food because the food was just as good,I ask the guy up front if i could get a burrito ,"""Obviously this isnt Anna's im not here for Anna's i want a Chipotle burrito wi",I dont usually come to this chipotle ,but if he could melt the cheese first,I know they usually add the cheese after ,but i like it really cheesy and melted and he said sure and was on his way to grab the cheese then a girl with short,th melted cheese,It wouldnt have hurt to just melt the cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I went an hour before closing and they didn't have white rice , When I asked for guac and chips I had to go get my own,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love their burritos with chicken ,and their rice plus their chips with lime was goo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Whole foods makes giant,I ordered a veggie burrito ,They put no veggies AT ALL in the thing and the burrito was wrapped wrong so that it was literally half,burritos for like $6 ,I was looking forward to that burrito :,I was looking forward to chipotle now that they've got the whole,half ice cold rice ,and beans abomination,and ended up getting a half sour cream, sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The servers were more interested in saving the food then giving it to customers,Regardless I enjoy the food the company offers so I overlooked the stingy,you would be charged for double meats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and even had some staff help us carry the food over,The food was incredible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my food was good,Since I think I now have a gluten allergy its not a good idea to partake in the flour tortillas and such so I just opted to get a burrito bowl (a small,I wanted to get the hard shelled tacos (one of my fav's ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is usually pretty good,Other then that the food is good,prices went up and they are stingier with the food,The carnitas can be fatty and the chicken can be dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got to the store and the food was not ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I must've gotten last night's chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everyone who prepped the food was so fast,I was still trying to figure out if I wanted a burrito or bowl by the time I was in the front of the line,and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Chipotle and how all their food is prepared in front of you so you know nothing shady is going on,Some of their food is even organic,I also LOVE their home-made guacamole,I LOVE their vinaigrette dressing they provide for the salads,they use natural ingredients without added,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chipotle on Roswell rd is one of my favs,I get rice bowls ,and add lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My first time at chipotles was horrible i walked in the food is all exposed to all kinds of germs ,and to top it of that is not real Mexican food  that place sucks fake food suc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1st timer here we got the burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only was the food great,I told the cashier not to worry about harangue and that I was an understanding that there wasn't much time to make the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,I have been hearing about a chipotle for a long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've worked at 4 different food jobs ,This is unnacceptable since every other chipotle ive,Easily the worst chipotle experience I've ever had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Skimp on food,Ordered double steak bowl and was giving just enough food to feed a infant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been craving burritos lately,but the burrito was so good,Prices are great,I finally learned that the corn is spicy and if you want mild to go with the salsa,Lots of ingredients to choose from,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I could have used a little more in the bowl,they failed to close the container on my salsa - salsa all over my passenger seat),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only chipotle that is consistent,Under cooked rice ,missing ingredients ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most recent experience the gentleman portioning my food didn't say a word to me the entire,This chipotles,I ended up with more cheese than rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the food was quite delicious,When I heard chipotle was opening up I thought great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is our favorite burrito place, We only get burritos, For fast burritos you can't get much better than a Chipotle , Chipotle is as good as it gets for burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The staff did a great job of getting food prepared for everyone in line,but then it took 10 minutes to pay for that food because they only had one cash register , My food was kind of cold by the time I paid for it because it had been sitting next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a bowl and ask the lady to not put too much rice on my bowl,I said not too much rice,The guy that was at the cash register asked for the money when I wasn't even done filling up my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went today to get my burrito,And I'm normally a huge chipotle fan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle ever always dirty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not because I have any notions of it being authentic Mexican food,my burrito bowl barely filled 2/3 of my container,they skimp on ingredients,I just like the taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't want to add extra calories or layers to my food,This location loves LOVES to make your food swim in sour,I have never yelped before but after several incidents of terrible burritos at this location I must say something,"I don't know why ""double wrapping"" a burrito is a thing ",I stopped ordering burritos ,Not only does it look like crap but that has got to be the tiniest burrito I have ever encounter from a Chipotle,there needs to be better training on loading and wrapping burritos,And laying off the sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stingy with meat ,and we order double meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even though they were super busy and ended up being out of an ingredient that I requested in my online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and if you love Mexican food i'd recommend i,I've had a burrito there ,There's one thing I've gotten so far that I've liked and it's the chicken tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My regular meal of burrito with sofritos is always big,And i get so much in one burrito i cant eat it all in one sitting,I have tried other places for burritos on the quick ,and always come back to chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They don't know how to role a burrito,most of the overpriced Guacamole squeezed out of the burrito into the foil,the burrito wasn't even closed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wanted to send a review to corporate but I couldn't find a way to do so on the chipotle website so here it goes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff is very friendly and while your waiting you can watch them make the food in front of you,The Burrito bowl with guacamole is awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fine," She said ""ok thanks"" walked away and went back to making burritos", There were huge clumps of dirt in corners on the floor ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've had the chicken burrito bowl here too,I wish I'd taken a picture of the tacos on the assembly line before the pico de gallo ,The whole taco was basically pico,I might as well have gotten a veggie taco,I will not be ordering tacos from here ever again,I'll go to one of those next time I have a craving for tacos,it was just okay mostly rice ,I've been to other Chipotle's and this one was either running out of meat ,I don't eat that much but basically they put like two very tiny pieces of steak on each tortilla shell,and cheese was added, and cheese,and cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I feel like the amount of food you get in a bowl or a burrito, This location has skimped me on food,I would just go during non-peak times to grab food here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stopped in the middle of preparing my bowl to tell his co-worker that I was speaking to him as if he didn't underst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So in terms of food ,I got my standard burrito bowl though,Though I will say that it seemed like some of the employees weren't sure which salsa was which,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My favorite combo is barbacoa soft tacos with rice,hot salsa,cheese & lettuce,sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food as with any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food-you will never leave here hungry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never looked at the person before or after me and wondered why did that jerk get more food than I did,It is hard to go more than 10 days without a burrito bowl,and now I want a burrito,unless there is a wait for brand new black beans,Speaking of the wait for black beans,""" Pretty sure you should have just waited for the black beans you could have had a perfect",I don't know how logically you can think an avocado even compares to black beans protein-wise,I have though experienced a vegetarian complaining about the amount of guacamole he got,and now everyone behind you and line wouldn't be talking behind your back about your begging for more guacamole,Everything tastes fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My chips were stale- have had better at other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is not the custoemr's problem if they run out of food,I had ordered 3 steak tacos,she put some meat on the first taco shell,but then on the 2nd and 3rd taco,at least same amount of the first taco,she did nto put any meat in the  other 2 tacos,The girl beside her was supposed to add some dressing or other ingredients on teh tacos,the taco shells were all soggy ,bye bye tacos,so I had to eat the meat separately from the broken tacos,the way you make tacos is by putting one taco shell over the other,she only put 2 invisible pieces of cut meat, and she finally said that it was not possible because they had to save on the meat since they were almost out of it,and the little meat that was inside ended up in the basket,yes it is great they only use organic meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's good for lunchtime food ,It's a chain burrito place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can't stand young people with attitudes working in food establishments,I should not be forced to pay for substandard qualify food , The girl preparing the chicken bowls on the 1st station gave us scraps of chicken,she threw an extra 3 pieces in the bowl,She got mad like it's her cheese,She dumped the old queso back in the old container and gave me a slopped up container with cheese all over it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In all my years of happily nomming on Chipotle burritos ,and bowls,curly hair deep within the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food of course is as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But you can't beat those burritos,Love the rice bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I use to like this chipotle location until a horrible,manager started nickel and dime you for extra rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would like to thank Haleigh and Brayden at the tualatin chipotle for always having fun ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no seating left inside and a LONG line to wait in to get your food, That is a lot of food ,but I think they are so busy on the food line that is what they stay focused on,Good food,Did I mention that a lot of the food is organic, I like the brown rice instead of white, The prices are very reasonable, If I leave off the cheese the whole bowl is 11 grams of fat, The plus for me is I can only eat half the bowl,grilled chicken, and pinto beans in favor of the black,beans, But any time I ask for a few more beans,one scoop of hot salsa,one scoop of medium salsa,The best of the salsas is the Medium,or a little more cheese or salsa, It is what I love with their chips,which their tortilla chips have a little, I try not to get the chips too often as they are NOT healthy, I have tried all four meats for the Burrito Bowls (steak, They also have freshly made guacamole,cheese , If if need to cut back and want healthy and lower fat/calories I leave off the cheese,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully not form giving away too much food,the cocaine they must be putting in their food just kept me coming back, i used to go often enough to where the manager would just give me a free burrito about once a week, I cant remember ever having a bad burrito there,doesnt compare (unless you like bland cheesy burritos),At one point I was so addicted that I had eaten at this chipotle over 30 times in a single,although depending on who's running the front of the line sometimes I get a little less chicken than I like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cons: Limited parking (has nothing to do with food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I take chicken and white rice,I like the bowl,The chips are great,I would try steak next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a regular stop for me on the way home for their reasonably priced (~$6-7) burritos that are huge,as all producers must adhere to standards for humanely raising their animals (and it even extends to their cheese,and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I paid 9$ for a burrito that I'll have to get my stomach pumped for,I am visiting from out of state & this chipotle was closest to where I am staying,My friend got a bowl,the chicken was so undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,I have been hearing about a chipotle for a long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""He'll have the kids' burrito","""The kids' meal doesn't come with a burrito",It comes with tacos or a quesadilla,And my husband and I both got overpriced bowls ,""" described as you choose three ingredients with corn or flour tortilla plus chips ",No chips,I had an experience yesterday that left a bad taste in my mouth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of the food is good, I usually have leftovers when I get my burrito bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no 'fast' food that compares,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I ordered a chicken burrito she told me that they were out of chicken,If you do have the misfortune of coming to this chipotle do yourself a favor and get a burrito bowl the crew here cannot roll a burrito to save their life,One crewmember who seems semi-competent had the intelligence to tell me that they were not out of chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
funny and one of the most flavorful chipotles We have ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food has always been fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" His name was david and he also was sitting down stuffing his face with food while his crew waited on a very long",They give their freinds free food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food as always,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food was hot and fresh though lettuce wasn't adequately washed given the nice little dead green bug that appeared atop my burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chicken was dried out - it was 2 pm so mane it just sat too long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their guacamole was just TERRIBLE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and suddenly I am cutting in to a giant burrito,then paying $10 for a burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got my usual order but when I got home I noticed that instead of extra sour cream,there was no sour cream at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will say the guacamole and carnitas burrito were good,I really thought chipotle was supposed to be better,The queso was flat out disgusting and the salsa,Half the chips were stale,It's like they mixed the old chips with the new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He passed my salad to the person who added another scoop of meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My girlfriend approached the counter immediately after sitting down because her food was cold,Indubitably the worst chipotle I've ever been to,If you are really craving chipotle today,instead of giving her another bowl or heating up the one she complained about,I decided to ask for double meat after they had moved on to the next,the lady might have given me another ounce of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't think they season any of the food or the food is just old,Drive a mile down to Moe's or Willy's to have some good burritos or bowls,My bowl was bl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worst chicken burrito I have ever had in Atlanta or for that matter anywhere,Willy's is the place for burritos in Atlanta  ,and this is where I will go next time I am in the mood for a chicken burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was inedible,It makes me never want to eat at chipotle again,gross guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The workers were friendly and the food was fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff at this chipotle never know what they're doing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,Don't even get me started on the poor quality of a pickup order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food quality is average,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love chipotle ,The servings were the smallest ever received at any chipotle,We got bowls,LAst visit no guacamole, This time no steak 15 minute,But the taste is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is a Taco Bell right next door that owns plenty of parking space that is unused that chipotle needs to buy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they aren't stingy with the ingredients like other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been to several other locations and I always get more food there than at this one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not only did I have ""authentic"" Mexican food at Mexican restaurants for the first",is not very large compared to the location on Campus but the food seems to be just a tad,read a paper and scarf down food at an alarming rate,Once upon a time the only burritos I'd ever had were from Taco Bell,I simply had to discover that I much prefer their fajitas to their burritos,the meat ,is the closest burger-joint strip to my apartment and I almost always pass over old favorites like Burger King to get my steak fajita,fire lanes and even the dumpster corner for their chance to wait in a line that goes out the door,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go to pick up your food ,and wait 30 mins while people who walk in get their food way before you ,The entire line was cleared and they all got their food including a young,More people came in later than me and got their food before me,By the time I finally got my steak salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service is always speedy and they load up the toppings on your burrito,I usually order the burrito bowl with corn taco shells on the side,which is great because they usually don't charge for the taco shells,It's delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because you'll go there and wait 30 minutes to eat terribly made food,All of sudden the place was staffed with people who couldn't make a burrito,couldn't figure out how much stuff cost and spent half their time wandering around wondering where all the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some of the line workers have started a trend of making you the smallest burrito possible,Why are you getting cheap on rice ,I find myself asking for more rice,and beans,and more beans every other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the burritos are massive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's like pulling teeth waiting for what feels like forever while being tempted by the sight and smell of food all around you,3 stars because I stopped caring about the wait time after I started eating my delicious chipotle tabasco sauce-drenched chicken burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just love the food,Really very delicious and healthy ( if you know which ingredients to add :P,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
employees could be friendlier but overall the food was what we were expecting to receive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a double chicken quesadilla ,they hardly put any chicken in it (despite me already paying for double, meat),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cold food,rice is crunchy,I'm terribly disappointed with the service n quality n multiple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is totally fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And my tacos even lacked flavor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've loved chipotle,But my perception of chipotle is rapidly deteriorating,When asked for more rice or beans, I guess all good things must succumb to profit making schemes over quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the employees have major attitude and their food quality is not good,Definitely not an entitled person as I have worked in food service ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your standard chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Certainly not life-changing in terms of Mexican food, And it can be tough to find hard-shell tacos, I will most certainly be back for more tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is freaking delicious,Open your mind and understand that places can achieve quality by means other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I never leave reviews but this chipotle is sub,Something is always going wrong at this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was just okay,I also don't like that they charge extra for chips and salsa,the chips were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The main employee prepping the food was in beast mode, He was putting food out as fast as he could ,and made sure that the preppers in the back kept delivering on food that was running low,Place was clean despite being so busy and that's usually something food places fail on ,My food was typical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They offer 4 menu items: burritos,I waited in line and then ordered a burrito,tacos ,tacos with corn tortillas,( I've  always gotten my tacos on corn tortillas,Guess that's the last time I'll ever go the chipotle,bowls,When it was time for the salad I was informed they had no lettuce,run out of lettuce,with corn tortillas,( I've  always gotten my on corn tortillas,and salads,and a salad to go,one of which is salad,I then chose a substitute for my salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff is super friendly and helpful and my burrito doesn't blow up ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grab our hot food,but I don't like all chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Ordered burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The people who work there are super friendly and helpful and the food is consistently excellent, I have been to a few other locations where people just seem grumpy and where the quality of the food is not as great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The brown rice was as hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was a time when I was obsessed with their burrito bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the slowest chipotle ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" Gave me a free burrito",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Liked the food before watching the documentary,Absolutely LOVE the food now that I know how well managed the company is,Always delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the girl making my burrito was in training (she really didn't know what she was doing),the guy making my burrito clearly hated his job,people like to come here before Red Sox games and (literally) order 10 burritos for their friends,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When it comes to fast food (food served in three minutes or less), They only do one thing and that's make great burritos - whether it comes in a tortilla or in a bowl,  You could do the grilled stuffed burrito thing at Taco Bell, Burritos with legitimately FRESH ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
order online but beware that sometimes your order isn't ready when it says it will be you just get your food made first ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely love their food,Always get their burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff and food is always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a steak bowl since,the geniuses in the kitchen did not cook enough chicken , There was a long line of people waiting for chicken from the kitchen ,Chipotle Steak (and I say the steak because I normally order chicken ,3 stars because at least the guacamole tasted good,and I figured I would just get steak rather than wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Try a local Mexican taco truck if you want better tasting food at a fraction of the price, Minus the sweet fish tacos, Pretty decent tacos at slightly inflated, prices, The corn salsa is very good,however as is the tomatillo salsa, The ingredients are a bit limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most of the time I get the burrito ,I had a bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got the burrito bowl, Then you pick your type of rice,beans,salsa,meat, You can see the chef's cooking the meat in the back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the chicken was cold the last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service here can get really slow and almost feels unpleasant for me to order my food,"""I love chipotle ",and chipotle is my life,Amazing like all the other chipotle chain establishments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but this weekend I think I wanted Chipotle every day in a pain medicated food stupor (""regular",Usually we never run out of them before we're in food comas,But I have had many a burrito where I stop eating it because it's become entirely rice,I think I'm just going to switch to bowls because they don't have to fold those up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was picking up bowls for both me ,I picked up chicken ,The person in front of me took the last of the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the quality of the food seems consistently good,the food is quite  filling,I don't quite understand how beans/rice/flour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why are your burritos so big,This is not usually a problem with burritos ,but a big burrito is not a value ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and failed to tell us until after our food was started, Another time they were out of rice,and another time it was chips,only to find out there were no chips,so I paid for chips , Tonight they were out of guacamole ,and guacamole I didn't even get,and corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and delicious meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Huge burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I gave my experience 2 stars because the food was basically st,The customer in front of me on line was telling the staff exactly how to make his burrito,how he wanted them to place the items in the burrito ,By the end of my burrito bowl order,my burrito bowl was only filled about halfway,I could still see the bottom of the bowl,Regardless I paid $8 for the dinkiest bowl ever,instructing the employees the exact number of spoonfuls of ingredients he wanted,I let it slide because I would have had to ask for all of my ingredients to be added in again,andard Chipotle quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but then to not get what you order and have to go through harassment to get your food a little,Customer service is definitely lacking and then when you order chips and cheese dip they don't give you chips and thenWhen you request chips they have to ask your manager if they can give you the chips that you paid for chipotle is already expensive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it took 20 minutes to get a burrito bowl,I got a gift card for a free burrito,I go back to redeem that free burrito,say there wasn't a 30 minute wait for a damn burrito with pre-made,This chipotle is always,a new not so friendly email to the corporate office and I've decided that I am done with chipotle for a while,So thus chipotle is known for the small,especially since it's only thus one chipotle,pay to park and get better service at the other chipotle,and the guy scoops a legit 1/2 cup of rice in the bowl,You can raise your prices ,it's scooped into a bowl, ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I want to thank you guys at the ocoee location for being so nice and of course the food is always phenomenal,The guy who made my steak bowl sounded very pleasant,Their chicken was out ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get a burrito bowl that is literally half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have a good amount of indoor seating and a lot more outdoor seating than most chipotle's,If you are not familiar with chipotle it is a great,their rice ,and meats (chicken ,and steak) have much more flavor than Moe's ,the ingredients are always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the guy on the line questioned why I was going out of order by requesting cheese instead of salsa,I told him that I liked my cheese to start melting over the meat b4 the other,I ordered a salad (they're super,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came to Chipotle today to get a fantastic burrito ,I made it clear that I wanted Guac on my burrito ,and then I was surprised to see that there was no Guac on my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Any one who eats here must never had a mother who cooked good food or not be really hungry,Chipotle our food love is over your not worth,tired of wet burritos ,tired of expecting good tacos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food is consistant,Chipotle is by far my favorite burrito/burrito,I get the burrito bowl - less calories than a burrito, bowl joint in Atlanta,It would be nice if they would include a handful of chips with the order,Their meat is amazing,The ingredients are extremely fresh, and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was quite good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went with my usual burrito ,I was ready to give the guy an out and request a double wrap on the burrito ,sealing an over stuffed burrito is one thing in person ,this was the biggest burrito I've ever seen,"like the type of burrito that makes you think ""maybe I went to far", I unwrapped the burrito in aww of the fact that it was somehow still intact,The next ten minutes were somewhat a blur but at the end my fingers were clean and dry (an unheard of feat with even a standard stuffed burrito) I am beyond satisfied,this dude fit every ingredient they have minus meat and dairy into the mere mortal bowl,but feeling adventurous tonight I went double steak ,"and added queso (which normally is a ""bugaboo"" in my book in fear of wet ingredient critical",I've had post 8pm Chipotle many times before and found the quality to drop exponentially,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm personally a sucker for a veggie burrito loaded with pretty much,UNLESS you're going meatless,Protip: If you're a guacamole fan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've come in here about 4 times in one month and each time I come the food is never ready,There's never a line BUT there is also never any food ready,This chipotle is never ready,One day there is no lettuce one day the rice is cooking one day there is no tomato sauce it's ridiculous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anyway the girl couldn't roll a burrito if her life depended on it,Both of our burritos were not completely wrapped with the tortilla so it was extremely messy,Also the cashier girl didn't ask me if I wanted anything else and just assumed I only wanted a burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great fresh food even 30 minutes before closing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Ordered a veggie burrito bowl,  Was charged for the guacamole on the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a lousy chipotle we are talking about,Ordered a bowl with brown rice assuming there was more,Did not say we have more or recommend the white rice,If you do not put advertised portions why would you charge at that price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Somehow out of cheese quite often,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While we waited for a food,The chicken,the quality of customer service ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place used to be really good but the service and the quality of the food has deteriorated in the past,Cold food,There seems to be a reoccurring theme here if you order the brown rice expect your food be lukewarm at best,The combination of them for fill application based ordering online and intermingling it with your order down the buffet line allows you an opportunity for your food to set 5 to 7 minutes before you receive it,My family once again talked me into trying to chipotles,hard rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here tastes like the chipotle everyone is used to,Unfortunately at other locations the food is usually not fresh,This is by far the best chipotle in Massachusetts, and doesn't taste up to st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first time I came in I ordered a burrito bowl with sofritas,Both times the bowl wasn't full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Always great food ,This chipotle is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They are extremely efficient at what they do during the lunch hour and the food is cooked with love,I feel like 3 1/2 stars for this chipotle is much to low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the food-most of their cooks get it right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I watched the cook burn the chicken ,Food quality is falling at this location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It you need good food quickly this is a safe,It is a typical chipotle with better than average,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ordered online came in a little earlier than the ETA of when the food should be done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a chicken salad,with hot salsa ,and sour cream nothing else,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really enjoy a good burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bland food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito size continues to shrink ,It's not a low priced fast casual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also do not know how to roll a burrito fell apart right away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a pretty quick chipotle with everything you've come to love ,they do let the meat dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food ,but I was very disappointed at the fact that the staff cannot roll a burrito correctly,and ingredients were great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Come here to get plenty of food on the cheap,I say the burrito bowls are the way to go,Not to say the actual burritos aren't great,Every time I have tried to eat the burrito wrap it always comes apart , but I think the bowl allows you to incorporate more condiments ,her meat that is,I happen to think she tastes delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fairly quick service and quality burrito construction,Sorry chipotle,Went back later and the grill was not fixed and they had no chicken or beef,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I tried to get a burrito bowl with (just) beans,That was a completely unacceptable experience at chipotle, The rice was at least twice as much,  It was basically going to become a rice ,The server put so few beans in the bowl I asked if there was a way I could buy a side of beans,At that point there was a communication breakdown and they started taking beans out of my bowl, I said thats not what I wanted and pointed out how few beans there were in the bowl,and lettuce bowl, as the beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This will not stop me from continuing my visits to chipotle,I try avoid adding rice because with such a heavy,I usually order a salad bowl so I can get more lettuce with the zesty vinaigrette,I did ask for extra tomatoes and extra corn which I did not receive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the salsa doesn't taste as fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this one is by far the stingiest when it comes to the amount of meat they dish out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will go to whole foods ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am always impressed with the chipotle operation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,over all the only Mexican food place to go t,exceptionally for guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm embarrassed to say it took me this long to try chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but still fabulous food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was served the most disappointing burrito of my life tonight,I ordered double meat (chicken and barbacoa)- an extra $4 compared to a normal chicken burrito,What I got was a balloon of sour cream and rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the meat is way over salted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Line moved really fast and the food was great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their food is always fresh,Chipotle has some amazing burritos, And i swear that this particular one tastes better than the rest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband got a burrito bowl,We weren't asked about chips or anything at the checkout,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you gave me 50% of my food ,I've literally seen them take things out of people's bowls to create unbelievably small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""  My boyfriend had the vegetarian burrito",The good: I had the three crunchy tacos,and the tacos,folks: how often do you bite into a crunchy taco ,this taco tastes amazing,"we were standing around for quite a while because they were ""restocking"" the rice ", themselves were actually delicious -- and I'm talking about the actual cornmeal TACOS,and he snarfed it down and proclaimed it to be delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also - he was really messy and couldn't care less about slamming food onto a tiny,The server made me feel like he was doing me a HUGE favour by putting together a basic burrito,burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The assembly line runs out of food ,they give you little servings of meat (basically what you're paying for),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I gave this location 1 star because the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is healthier than most fast,food options , The food is budget friendly as well,and yet it still tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chicken bowl with guacamole,and chips as usual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only reason this place gets a star AT ALL is because many of my friends and co-workers go here on a regular basis and usually have great things to say about the food ,but please at least give a s*** when you are making my food ,Weak food,Not to mention all of the people in line behind me waiting to pay for their food ,awful food,I had to ask the lady making my burrito bowl THREE TIMES to please give me a full,I promise I'm not really a picky person --I don't require my burrito to look like a work of art,"Well what I thought was going to be a giftcard of some kind was actually just that --a card that was for a ""buy one get one free"" burrito","but evidently you have to ""know somebody"" to get quality service or even the right portions for the price you are paying", scoop of ingredients (mainly the pico,which was 90% leftover juice at the bottom of the container clumsily dumped on top of my fresh ingredients),and recognize the fact that I am indeed paying for that service and the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I eat chipotle a lot ,The rice is crunchy,I'm eating my bowl right now (Togo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were very nice and the food was very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito bowl itself came with a ton of food - definitely had to split it into two meals,Tip for anyone who wants to maximize the amount of food in a free,It comes out to a monstrous amount of food,Chipotle was offering a free burrito promotion to customers who texted a code on their website to a number,I did so and received a coupon for a free burrito to use in the next,I decided to use my free burrito for lunch today,I was able to get my burrito made ,but it was a decent burrito nonetheless,Chipotle burrito: order a burrito bowl with two types of meat,double rice,The grilled chicken was well-seasoned,both types of beans,guacamole,sour cream,In terms of taste I prefer Felipe's or Ana's taqueria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got my veggie burrito bowl just now,Worst chipotle here with worst,my wife is a big fan of chipotle ,almost zero rice & beans,no guacamole ,very bad quality & quantity for the amount they charged us ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A line out the door and chipotle is out of half of the ingredients at 9pm at night,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1) The food is old,Never had a problem with the food quality,I've been here three times and each time the steak was clearly bland and the rest of the food stale,salsa,2) I love their guacamole,I asked for guacamole,00 extra for guacamole,was working the half of the line with the lettuce,I assumed a manager was trying to cut corners to boost numbers,I firmly believe this Chipotle's manager is the reason for it's sub-par quality,but this location does not live up to it's name or quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Old food served at opening,day old guacamole,The quality has gone down since the last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality ,my bowl is disappointingly empty,I can literally see the bottom of the bowl (before I start eating it),A good fifth of the bowl is completely empty,I mean the sour cream doesn't even stick to the lid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hence my love for Mexican food (real,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and give you less food than you deserve,I would always get a steak burrito every time,I've always thought that this branch didn't put enough steak inside (usually half a scoop) compared to most other,I found out that the guy that scoops up the steak actually discriminates how much,steak he gives out,He scooped out 2 full scoops of steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Absolutely positively most certainly THE WORST chipotle in the world,this is my neighborhood chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Picked around the hot food ,Burrito bowl (mild) with wraps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Comes back with the grossest looking tomatoes and now I'm praying I don't get food poisoning,food all over the floor ,Worst chipotle I've ever been to,AVOID this chipotle- incompetent workers ,and watched an employee lick her fingers before going in the back to search for salsa,and lettuce,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You know what you're getting and it's delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 At one point of time I was suffering from such an addiction for my usual order of a barbacoa bowl ,and a bag of chips that I would switch between the two locations so the workers did not have a clue how often I really ate there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$7 for half a scoop of rice,half a scoop of beans and 5 cubes of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting a burrito usually takes 30-60,my burrito/salad/bowl tastes pretty comparable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Tonight it was rice,last time the chicken was a 10 min wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was gross there was a lot of food ,It wasn't terribly busy so there should have been someone cleaning up all the trash/food on the floor ,The food was good,I'm a huge fan of chipotle i normally go to the Woburn one , as always but I will no longer be going to this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It takes about 30 minutes to get food,and when you finally get food they give you barely anything,it's cheaper and the food it better,They always skimp on ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But otherwise this location is typical chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best burrito I've ever had and I am certainly not a fan of Mexican food ,I love how you watch the make your food right in front of you ,If the burrito weren't 900 calories I'd definitely go back today for seconds,and just the fact that they offer brown rice is a plus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chicken, Same meal with DOUBLE MEAT (chicken ," I ordered a ""BOWL"" with beans",the meat quality here SUCKS, I eat a lot of meat,and fish and I actually have a clue about how to pick good meat ,Their god damn meat is not fit," Same general reaction - ""This meat is DOG SHIT awful"," I made a real effort to break this piece of ""meat"" down with my teeth",and guacamole, Same meal with DOUBLE MEAT ( and steak),"""  One of the pieces of ""steak"" in my ""Bowl"" was totally UNCHEWABLE", And it had a weird taste to it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worst chipotle I have ever been to in my life,Serving amounts vary and always less than other chipotle restaurants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is bomb ,fresh and tastes really goo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd say the food quality is a bit worse than the st, The chicken (my st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had the girl putting my burrito in the bag belch damn near in my face(cant make that up) Absolutely uncalled for especially on a food line I just had my food made on,After walking through the door and watching the guy who starts my burrito throw his h,After he filled my burrito ,That speaks to the area this chipotle ,he was still making un-called for comments about the extra ingredients I got ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today I place an order online for a burrito with everything in it,& and a second order for a burrito bowl with everything on the side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place used to be really good but the service and the quality of the food has deteriorated in the past,Cold food,hard rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The portions and ratio of selected ingredients were borderline,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burrito in hand,the burritos (or burrito bowl,maybe the elongated shape is more congenial to the burrito's essence - it is hard,if you are into that sort of thing) ACTUALLY taste better than opposing places,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The place is always spotless and the food is super,this burrito is delicious,they don't mind custom requests (burrito bowl,half white rice,black beans,corn salsa,cheese it up,light sour cream,light lettuce, Is it because it is tucked in the corner of a strip mall where most business have failed in the last, fresh and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I do not think the food is better than any other, mexican restaurant and the prices are not better either,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Ordered a burrito with half,The burrito was watery , chicken ,Chips and salsa were not edible, due to the amount of salt caked onto the chips,The server scraped the bottom of both containers barely getting enough meat for a total of a half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Still amazing food though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Last night I was super hungry after a late evening hair appointment so I went with the carnitas burrito , I really do love the carnitas burrito , For people who always order the black beans,"try to resist your automatic ""black beans"" response ",and try the pinto beans, The pinto beans have so much,and guacamole and chips, The pre-portioned bag of chips is a bit skimpy, They don't give you as much meat as they used to give you, Though there were plenty to go with my guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Give me a burrito bowl with steak , I just wished the chips had more salt, and lime taste as they use to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like the size salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and so is the quality of the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice,different kinds of beans,and cheese to choose from,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't plan on dining in unless you want lines of people knocking food off your table & hearing all your conversations,I suspect this is partly because the kitchen is always behind on keeping food prepped & cooked,I then get attitude for telling them to put more in the bowl,I love salsas on my bowls,He came back & worked on another person's bowl,Their pico de gallo (mild) salsa is nothing more than mashed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I received a coupon in the mail for a free burrito , I ordered a steak burrito with the medium salsa,beans and rice was pretty, The medium salsa was actually pretty, The chips with guac was excellent, The ratio of steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and then began to make himself a burrito bowl,and another making taco shells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now that they got us all addicted to their food,Tea spoon of rice,They started to be cheap and put literally 5 pieces of meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tomato salsa is not freshly-made,taste of products involving salsa is inferior,or does not taste like it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had to wait 15 on my steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The other and main reasons why I hate this location is because one time I found a hair in my burrito ,I contacted chipotle about the hair ,and then recently my chicken was pink,and they solved the issue there but I haven't mentioned the chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also work with food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your frustration will out way your need for chipotle,I guess we'll have to go to medford for a proper chipotle anything,they miss items that you asked for and just don't get the chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The burritos are large, I just can't see paying almost $9 for a burrito, Try going to Baja Fresh for about the same burrito,the steak was quite tough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came here for the first time a couple years to get a free burrito for Halloween,Good quality at a great price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taste- well as long as its better than dorm food right,skimp on the stuff compare to other locations and I swear the ingredients, taste ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We all know Chipotle food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice is moist, and flavorful and the chicken is never dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The order was messed up as I asked for no tomatoes and light sour cream,When I opened the lid the sour cream spilled out ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been coming to this chipotle for what seems like forever,Sometimes they seem to be a little short staffed or maybe its just because this chipotle is so popular,I will gladly call this MY chipotle :,Then after he gave me a bogo he sat down and took someone's order who was waiting on the side for brown rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
being that I was in the food industry ,I do appreciate that they try their best and their food is always consistent,I've never gotten sick from chipotles food ,and enjoy their food a lot,This chipotle is one of the busiest I've ever been through,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm never gonna stop eating at chipo but don't treat me like a Paige and make me beg for a decent serving of meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 If I was rating just based on the food most Chipotle's would do quite well with a 4-5,Excellent food , That may be more comfortable for the staff working the grill but it's freezing for us folks stopping in for a fat burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Food is fine (if you can get them to give it to you) but the service is more than twice as slow as any other chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I appreciate that they're food is fresh,and the food just does not live up to Chipotle,brown rice,and it annoys me that the other restaurants don't have brown rice,My bowl I do here is pretty,chicken, I do black beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All the food on the line looked like it had been sitting there for hours ,but that food still needs to be rotated out,the chicken and  brown rice were not warm at all,The guacamole was disgusting,never heard that term before) had way too much cheese ,and even with all that melted cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I used to love chipotle ,but over the years quality became big issue with them and most of ppl I know stop eating chipotle because of it, I order the chip with my bowl,only the chicken or the steak seems just made, First thing I notice is most of the ingredients are leftovers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food doesn't have the same,The bowl was a mess,The salsas were put on sparingly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sorry but the food stinks ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was solid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Healthy delicious food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always have the best experience with both the food ,stop what you're doing and finish making their food,and was looking forward to a veggie burrito,But I proceeded to walk to the line and was greeted by a very nice girl and I told her I wanted a veggie burrito,did I not say in the VERY beginning I wanted a veggie burrito,She then asked what type of beans and rice,So now the girl who got me my beans and rice stepped in ,as I'm fasting and have given up meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Smaller portions than any other chipotle,Raw chicken is a common,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  Good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not very good at rolling burritos or taco,tacos are so tiny,Took my order to go and upon eating it realized that the cheese never melt into my tacos meaning that the chicken ,and rice they put on the tacos were not hot,This is literally the worst chipotle I have ever been too,go to a different chipotle,Are almost always out of steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These are by far the smallest burrito bowls of any Chipotle I've been to,Something is up with their rice process as well,The brown rice is usually always too dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My favorite thing about this chipotle is the patio,My order is always right and the ingredients are always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and we were definitely skimped on the food portions given in our burrito bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a bowl ,maybe the salsa,I couldn't find the cheese,and asked for lettuce on it,I got home and had literally 8 pieces of sliced lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Im one of those southern californian mexican food snobs,I do however know that a burrito can be amazing without being authentic,They never skimp on the burrito,I've never been disappointed here except when i waited 45 minutes in the rain to get my free burrito on opening day,I honestly think this chipotle is better than most I've been to in California,which may only be a bad thing with guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got the chicken burrito ,I generally like Chipotle but this chain doesn't taste the same,Something just tasted off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality is pretty much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wasn't a big fan of burritos until I tried Chipotle for the first,I absolutely LOVE burritos, I LOVE Chipotle's steak burritos,I always ask for PLAIN white rice when I order my beloved steak burrito,I get my Chipotle steak burrito with their red-chili,and lettuce - which wraps up into the PERFECT steak burrito for people like me who hate cilantro,"18 (including tax) for a ""fast food"" steak burrito is a bit pricey",this Chipotle gets 5 stars - for their amazing burritos made with fresh, I cover each bite of my burrito with this smoky,flavorful sauce - which makes an already delicious burrito heavenly,Since I absolutely can't stand cilantro (not even little bits of it mixed with rice),the employees usually have no problem asking someone in the back to grab the container full of freshly-cooked white rice so that they can scoop some up just for me,"be sure to emphasize that you want ""just a little"" rice",they will give you WAY more rice than the normal,but I feel like the price continues to rise because even if they do, I ask them to top the steak with pinto beans,(HOT) salsa because it's the ONLY salsa that they have that doesn't contain even a trace of cilantro, And really - the cubes of steak are ALWAYS soft,cheese,sour cream, ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food is all over the place (mixed,into each other's containers and all over the counter) and the quality of the food itself seems to have gone down as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but how can I enjoy their food if the server cheats me out of my food,I got a chicken burrito bowl,and appreciate from chipotle ,but the woman who served me forgot to add any rice,She put a little bit of rice,or chicken,chicken,beans,and beans ,I hold Chipotle to a high standard since they raise their meat right,and  and stockpiled a lot of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 people didn't get cheese in their burriotos and my salads have been mostly salsa ,and lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
burritos,but the burritos are the size of a healthy,Squeeky clean place for tacos,and salad  most mains around $6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fresh food ,the food is worth the wait,Try the fresh made guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This one star is not for the food,Regardless of location I feel like chipotles food is pretty,I'm a big supporter of chipotle,This woman has to be the rudest person who's ever worked in a chipotle,When my bowl got to the lettuce,I like a little crunch in my bowl,The cashier could tell that was I pretty offended and gave me some guacamole ,the woman gave me literally 3 pieces of lettuce,My gosh I wasn't asking for more of everything I asked for some more lettuce,or in my case lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like Mexican food,But here's the thing: Their food just doesn't taste good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We drove out of our way to patronize this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here does feel fresher ,Got a burrito with Barbacoa (,Also got chips with guac,The chips are indeed different,and taste much better than the ones from the supermarket,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and this time they did include lettuce and my burritos were huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle I've ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle and their food ,There is literally NO WHERE to park and this is not the first time that I have had to leave without food because of it,"but ""no chipotle parking allowed"" was being yelled at me",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hope you didn't want a burrito,Nobody wants to sit down to eat with yesterday's sour cream smeared on the table,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you're not on a diet than you can enjoy a delicious bowl with cilantro lime rice or a big fat burrito filled with fresh,Strangely enough chipotle is a healthy,chipotle  is my lif,a salad plus steak plus corn salsa , ingredients,All in all a delicious place with fresh ingredients,All in all a delicious place with fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm so sorry to have to say this about a local chain that took off nationally and has tried hard to provide healthy food ,where you order a burrito bowl ,I ordered my burrito bowl anyway,but with chips on the bottom rather than rice,and they loaded it with about a pound of rice first,that they both flooded the rice,black beans,black beans tasted fine,You can only buy chips as a side with salsa,tomatillo salsa,The tomatillo salsa was really good,The meat had good, tasted fine but so much liquid like the meat,guacamole ,the guacamole was very bl,cheese,The cheese was fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came here for a burrito a couple of days ago,I ordered a burrito with guac,The burrito was good,You definitely  get more in a burrito than in the bowl,it is still a chain and they don't have the cheese sauce of their competitor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
etc are all around the same price as Chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reliable Mexican food that is good,but not great - I prefer the burrito bowl to the burrito,I always am frustrated that they don't include chips with their orders much like Baja Fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This location seems like it had its speedy food making skills down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
standard mexican style food,Reasonably priced ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got steak tacos,They tasted like garbage wrapped in flour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inexpensive- Tasty- Fresh food,Too salty though (look on their website at the sodium content on a chick burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mexican food this is your place,The steak is my least favorite of there meats (,I would rank the meat options as follows: 1) Carnitas,and I love steak),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My son has severe food allergies ,For anyone with food allergies we highly recommend this Chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is really good, We always leave with an empty wallet but it's always satisfying to eat their food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every one of them is an amazing place but at this location the magic AND the food is MISSING :(,chipotle on the whole are friggin,I love chipotle,There is a chipotle at Medlock Bridge,I asked for more than the wee bit of rice they put into my bowl ,I just got back from the place having ordered a bowl ,and was given a bowl so low,in servings that the bowl rattled on my drive back home,the young lady walked away to chat with her friends in the corner and grab a bowl for herself,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20% of your meat menu is not available,   It's lunch hour rush and no steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was very persistent and said I would wait or she can throw the food away ,Went in for veggie bowl/salad ,I asked well can you make some bc I can't eat a dry salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Mexican food so Chipotle has always been a go-to,inexpensive food on the road can be challenging, There is no one who can tell you if there will be more corn or steak while these are st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I got the bowl of rice,steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but when it's dirty like this one makes me not enjoy my food as good,I love chipotle,I asked for half chicken half barbacoa and they barely put any barbacoa on my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chipotle delivery) they mess up the order ,Love chipotle ,and ALWAYS forget to put guacamole,They also forget lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When my husband and I got home the guac was so salty that we couldn't eat it and his burrito was also incredibly salty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am burrito snob, Corn salsa in the burrito was an A-plus,not authentic and too pricey,the sour cream being included in the price is BRILLIANT ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's hard to really judge the food,The quality of the food is pretty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let's start with the fact that Chipotle raises their prices at a few,I chose this location over Kirkman due to convenience I have t been to the Kirkman location in awhile hoping their prices haven't changed too ,a lack of rice variety,only white rice available,nobody offered me my beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food gets 5 stars,The food is insanely delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got SEVERE food poisoning after eating a chicken burrito bowl here yesterday,Do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else unless you want to end up with really bad food poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only Chiplotle restaurant in Orlando I feel like costumer service is good and the place/food is clean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always get good food here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and he always comes out to remove food from people's tables ,we were treated so rudely by the lady wrapping the burritos that I was just pissed off the entire,I had to step in and all but tell the woman to unwrap the damn burrito ,and when my girlfriend said it was chicken,My roommate and I have noticed that it doesn't look anything like the salsa at any other,and she tried to charge my girlfriend for steak,it's steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For this to be a food chain it is delicious,The staff working here are actually the BEST fast-food staff in Boston,It's quick and they over load your burrito,All the ingredients are super,They love their job and i would to if i was around delicious ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've experienced better chipotles,but only because its close by and chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always fresh and it tastes great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They said they were ""out of chips"" ridiculous",My corn was frozen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came in at 930 and they had dried out meat dry rice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The sofritas here taste really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service and food are consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 My usual go to is the burrito bowl with rice,steak,cheese,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what a concept: fresh food,while the boyfriend can get the hot & spicy foods he loves,I don't like anything remotely spicy and i can get a burrito bowl that is perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only reason it's not 1 star is because the food is still insanely good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like it because it is filling and healthier than many fast-food lunch options,Also there was food all over the floor ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's always a huge line because it take five minutes for them to make a burrito bowl,I made the mistake of giving it another shot today and it took 15 minutes for me to get a burrito,I have never reviewed anything on yelp but this chipotle drives me insane,I live very close to this location and I choose to drive to another chipotle,Every other chipotle has stations while this one has everyone just w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle reigns supreme when it comes to my favorite comfort food,They make a killer fajita burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seems the only way for them to not mess it up is to wait in line and show them exactly which ingredients you want on your burrito or bowl,This chipotle is by far the worst one I have ever been to,The portions are terribly small and even after asking for extra you barely get the regular sized portion you would get at any other chipotle,I will no longer order food at this restaurant and make the further drive to the chipotle in Dublin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pick your food of choice,The best deal on the menu in my opinion is the steak burrito,because it's only seventy cents more than the veggie burrito,"This time we went the chips were stale and the salsa was just ""okay",The biggest rip off here is a dallop of guacamole at a whopping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but food was cold, and the chicken taste was not on the same level as the other atlanta area chipotle's i've been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two stars just because my food was okay,I asked him to show it to the manager and she told him that's how the steak is cooked at chipotle,Sorry lady but my kids eat at chipotle all the time ,even though the rice is under cooked,My son asked for a bowl with steak,And I got the same answer I told her to switch out his bowl for a chicken,So I got up with a pink piece of meat in my h,and and told her the meat is not even cooked,Don't justify your mistake specially when serving raw meat,the steak still had blood in it,If I want raw piece of steak I'll go to a steak house,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is great,love the chicken salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was top,I love this restaurant because getting food is so quick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can taste the difference in the food here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is usually pretty,my food was already cold,The rating is specifically for the fajita quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Employees making your burrito could care less about what you're ordering,Even trying to wrap burritos that are SO full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Needless to say I eat here way too much out of convenience and taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Considering the girth of these delicious burritos ,but i had to trade that in with all that burrito goodness I simply craved every few,I still have a smile on my face from the satisfaction that burrito gave me last,The chipotle here was twice as large,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I kept spitting out my beef while having my burrito ,I love chipotle,but avoid the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is the best burrito chain IMO, I have to give credit to Chipotle for getting me to like guacamole,and I always compare other guacamoles to Chipotle's, Their ingredients, taste fresher ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they put a ton of guac on the burrito so if you don't want a lot (which I always do),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super impressed with the service and quality of food today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Before it has been taco shells or guacamole,Today it was cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cold beans ,and stale chips,No lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the trainees who made my burritos were slow,couldn't WRAP the burrito,And the ingredients that are supposed to be warm (the meat) are now cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The business is slow at times but the food is pretty, standard for a chipotle,on occasion the rice isn't cooked all the way,The bowls are great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ended up getting food poising -I,they were scraping the last of the nasty looking sour cream into my burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is someone new making the burritos,Dripping in sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A bowl had to be thrown away because of how fast,he's putting it on my bowl,They are very skimpy with the meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are aggressively stingy on their ingredients and sometimes I feel like I'm eating just a tortilla with lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place used to be really good but the service and the quality of the food has deteriorated in the past,Cold food,The customer service and quality of food continues to deteriorate at this location,The food at best was lukewarm the crew behind the counter could not get the rack together a combination of a long,This is the first occasion that we've experienced or service at this location I think will move our business to a different chipotle's,hard rice,When requesting Carnitas the employee looked perplexed and said steak or chicken finally we communicated by saying pork,They actually made our order twice just to get it right while we were standing there telling the young lady behind the counter no stop you're not supposed to use that ingredient on our order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And you run out of steak and chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The people working here are shady and they won't tell you that they don't have forks and spoons for your 'to stay' meals until after you pay for the food,good Maxican food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was Chipotle st, I waited no more than five minutes for my delicious burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the chips have been cooked to perfection,and they tasted over cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their food tastes really fresh,their burritos are amazing,burritos are a savior for our caloric needs,with decently-sourced ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you shouldn't be complaining about what they put on your food, If you don't want a lot of guacamole,tell them not to put a lot of guacamole on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it was OK but my bowl was poorly served with other,I tried the new ingredient (chorizo), ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is as good,Guess chipotle doesn't bother with it since this location still makes them mone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" Maybe things like this have gotten more complicated since I left food service years back",the rice is almost always over-cooked,the beans are more juice,than beans,but between being charged for chips I didn't order to the manager laughing about it in one instance,"They either can't hear or just can't comprehend simple instructions such as ""light on the sour cream"" or ""one scoop only please",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,excellent prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the guac that was added to everyone's ""bowl"" orders was brown","they forgot all of the guac on the ""chips ","and guacamole"" orders",It was literally a lettuce soup by the time I got it,and the big kicker for me was that they put my salad in the oven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This lack of attention to service makes me question if the same attention to detail is given to the food,The person who created my burrito bowl was literally just slapping sauces ,I absolutely love chipotle so it very sad,Every table was very dirty and the rice was undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Good burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered food ahead of time using the online option, Tried a bit of each taco wise , The chicken taco ,and the tofu taco were pretty good, I had the soft corn tortilla with the tomatilla salsa, We picked up our order and we were home before we realized they had forgotten to include the chips and salsa we ordered (,and wouldn't recommend the steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got the chicken burrito with black, I don't think I'll get meat if I order here again - the texture of the chicken was a bit too much,beans,sour cream & cheese,& the sour cream is a little,I didn't feel like the service or quality lacked too much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the buritto preparation areas are stocked with fresh ingredients and they can really put together a big ass burrito,The corn salsa is sweet and spicy and the chipotle one is great,I think the rice ,and beans are fresher ,They also offer a variety of salsas,no chips unless you pay extra,The meats are also better,The sour cream is free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of the food is not as good,"the ""manager"" ran over and specified how I would be paying for each thing individually like those beans and little thing of rice would've ended the business", (mushy salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are burritos,and then there are Chipotle burritos,Some days (like last night) nothing will satisfy my hunger like a Chipotle burrito or burrito bowl,Fresh rice,beans,fresh tomato and corn salsas,savory barbacoa meat,cheese,ooey gooey sour cream,and crunchy lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
healthy food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When you order your food just let them know that you need a gluten-free,They will change their gloves and also use a new container of cheese ,and lettuce to avoid cross-contamination,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please at least give me the right sub-par burrito if you're going to charge me incorrectly for i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They not only give you just one scoop but they are shaking of most of the food from the spoons,I came to Chipotle on free burrito day ,and received an amazing barbacoa burrito bowl with everything plus guacamole in addition to a free,having paid for my burrito I am extremely disappointed,It was so huge that my tortilla busted open to the point that they had to give me a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Usually get the chicken or veggie burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Solid service and food,You know exactly what you're getting and it's a good price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but then the food is fresher so I don't mind the wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know I am a simpleton for enjoying the burrito bol so much, And their chips seem like the most incredibly delicious,chips I have had,and the chips, And the margaritas are so alcoholly and delicious ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get your moneys worth and the food is so fresh,The people here are so sweet and not afraid to fill up that salad bowl,I hate when you pay extra for guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The price was moderate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love a good burrito as much as the best person,but do yourself a favor and avoid this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get that chipotle is popular,Chipotle is delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chips and salsa: chips are a little, thicker than your usual tortilla chips (I liked this) ,But make sure that you check that the chips are fresh, One time I went there we got fresh chips mixed,in with very stale chips,taste is similar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Incredibly poor customer service plus long wait times if you want/need chipotle their upper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 And I love the rice, I mostly enjoy a salad or one of their bowls, This is because they do their chicken very,I have to admit that I'm spoiled and wish they offered free chips and salsa every time I go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is my go to spot when I don't want to eat any junk food, I especially like to come here for lunch and what I'll usually do is pre-order online and when I arrive all I do is go straight to the registers and pick up my food,and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle always has the dirtiest bathrooms ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 There are a bevy of burrito places around town: Chipotle,they're reasonably priced ,The only downfall of Chipotle in general is that they charge extra for guacamole,or maybe it's because their spicy vinaigrette for the salads has crack secretly mixed,I think their salads are awesome, The staff working behind the glass are friendly and listen to my requests as they're building my salad,and good quality , And it all tastes hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My sofritas burrito tasted great,The guys assembling my burrito were really friendly,but the rice was too hard, and generous with my portions (especially the guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and quality of the food has improved,the guy who made my salad even walked around the restaurant and asked everyone how their food was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also they didn't give me a full portion of chicken on my tacos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are constantly out of ingredients so by the time you get your food the first,The amount of food they give you In a serving is half that of other,This is the absolute worst chipotle I've been to in six or seven states, chipotles, half of the bowl is ice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At least they give you a lot of food,The burritos aren't great,However sometimes I think that they could get a little more creative with their burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They ran out of chipotle sauce ,We love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food line is nasty,and cluttered with food,other than all the negative that comes with this store the food is so surprisingly good,This poor chipotle,they ran out of white rice ,and had NO chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When it comes to sauce I ask everyone making my food to make it swim,I love sauce and spicy food,All and all I love the staff here and I love the food,Their reaction my continuous request to pour on more and more and more is priceless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually go to this location and have no problems but today I went and got a burrito bowl with guacamole,I love chipotle ,There is a big old avocado seed in my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The chipotle crave is a curse ,its already on your bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-Big burritos, I won't be running in here anytime soon but it will be my first choice if I want a burrito fix,-simple menu -even has definitions on the types of meat so I didn't need to whip out my span-english,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wish they'd move the tables at the entrance to the wall so that people on line don't stick their hands in your food - it feels that close,insist on getting more food,And the rice was just marginally good,The chicken was much too fat,My wife doesn't like the way they cook the beans at locations closer to us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the good thing about that is you can always expect good food,It is reasonably priced and you get a ton of food,Oh and the chips are delicious,They have good quality meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I mean it's better than Mc or BK but when there are better Mexican food options why go here,is it my go to place for burritos/Mexican food Nope,Have limited menu (burritos with its variations ,and tacos),same taste mostly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Either other locations give too much food or this one gives too little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Parking in the small shopping plaza is a pain due to the triangular layout but we still brave the cramp parking spots to order the bowls here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,Rice/beans don't go on the tacos,so the tacos were wayyyy too full,It was quick and filling but 6 soft tacos ,95 for guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the burrito bowl man,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything is crowded around Red Sox games because it makes sense to get a meal for around $10 instead of paying for overpriced ballpark food,they just taste junky and you barely want to make it halfway through your burrito bowl,sometimes the ingredients, taste great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just  a great place to grab a healthy burrito ,just ask for less rice ,and chips with awesome,guacamole,it's almost like eating canned ingredients vs,Illegal Petes needs to step up and get better ingredients ,which probably means they care too much about quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We get either the chicken or sofritas burrito bowl,What's not to like at chipotle,If you get a veggie bowl (no sofritas),the guacamole is free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
consistently fresh cooked awesomely healthy food,Sofritas are tasty in the burrito bowl as is the chicken,perfect with the lime cilantro brown rice,Good hot salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were out of one ingredient ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but this chipotle was very generous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoy chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only reason I go to Chipotle anymore is because I enjoy the food,but it looks awful when they have a line out the door and chipotle shirts st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is served wrapped in aluminum foil,This is a basic burrito bar,lots of rice ,on a paper covered plastic bowl,and beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let me begin by saying I just moved back to the Northeast from Southern California so might just be a little prejudicial in my high standards of Mexican food,I will continue to try to seek out a mom/pop establishent with quality Mexican food in the Northeast,I ordered a carnitas burrito,My total for a burrito ,the burrito was not even warm on the first,on went the large spoonful of rice ,"As he approached the bowl of guacamole the guy says ""Guacamole",and beans to fill out this thing,and proceeded down the line with the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Did you know they make all their food in house,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Portion to price is usually on par,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Low score because foods was served warm,I'm a stickler for hot food ,rice ,and beans ,Chicken had a nice grill flavor and with the toppings of salsa,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not a fan of mexican food,(can i consider chipotle real mexican food,forget what i said) every burrito from chipotle has been excellent,but chipotle has changed that,our combo (chicken bowl): white rice,one bowl is enough,get a cover to shake the bowl ,chicken,black beans,mild salsa,cheese,sour cream,lettuce,corn,simply delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not saying this is a great mexican food,I'm just saying its tasty food,"Lets get a ""buy X number of burritos/bowls/tacos ",I love their bowls,I love that the guy who works the counter (Tony) remembers me and what I like in my bowl,hot and tastes pretty dang good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they keep burritos moving out the door,A note to motorists: it sits at the corner of Northwest ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh,Anyways the food is always good,I love chipotle,Also this chipotle is in a good,I also noticed they give less than other locations and you have to ask for some more lettuce or something like that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The foods good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think the Carne Asada (""Steak"") is waaay to dense to serve by 1/2"" cubes in a huge burrito",I stick with chicken ,You can get a combination of salsas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Attitudes as healthy as the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am not a Mexican food fan,but I'm not really into Mexican food typically,I heard about Chipotle through a few media events that talked about the chain as getting their food from the best places,especially if you are not a HUGE Mexican food fan,This is just plain good food,I am a chicken burrito fan,I could eat the chicken burrito every day,was that they cared more about all of that than they did the prices,They knew their prices were a little,The rice has a little,only buying humanely treated chicken,The chicken is tender ,The corn and cheese and Sour Cream and black beans mixed,I like my share of tortilla chips and Guac or salsa,getting the freshest ingredients,but they cared more about offering a quality product,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and got my burrito,I went in after watching a movie and found that they had run out of rice,I waited 30 minutes for that rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I did just entirely give up on ever getting a burrito because of how many,I also tried getting small taco tortillas on the side for a bowl to get the same,Then the girl who was the cashier had taken some cups of rice ,and beans to a table and he started yelling to her for some reason about what to mark the lid as since I got half chicken ,it was with employees who probably recognize me so they charge me for chicken,then when I was saying I wanted veggies he was somehow taking this as black beans,"""we charge for the more expensive meat",and half steak,She charged me for steak ,He put so much cheese on top that it could have been considered a mountain in Florida,Because I realized how much I need their salads in my life I have kept coming here way too much,Since the last time I had been in and ordered this same combination on a salad,and everything tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we waited 17 minutes for a steak burrito,and then they started chopping chicken (which they were not out of) for another few,They even managed to mess up guacamole,They were out of steak,Then they finally had steak,nothing ever tastes quite right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 People who work here are joking around and only 1 person is preparing food for a line of 40 plus people, The owner of this Chipotle should be ashamed he's ruined such an awesome food chain,I they ripped the burrito twice ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The line moves quickly and the food always tastes great,made-to-order burritos ,and burrito bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always running out of food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Steak burritos with hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also don't review if you're ordering veggie burritos or vegan,The steak burrito - awesome,The chicken salad,$2 for guacamole seemed,Your taste buds will definitely be biased,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because the food is really,But all in all it's awesome food ,Every time I go I get the steak burrito bowl ,Sometimes the meat is a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked the guy manning the food to surprise me with burrito choices,and he made me an absolutely wonderful burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It tops it off for me on a beautiful day to eat fresh food,there is always beer :)  The prices are good, The lime chips will appease any salt craving, The ingredients are always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think this location does do a very good job with cleanliness and quality of the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't really seek out fake Mexican food,my guy is into anything that is fake Mexican food,The food is delicious,but definitely comfort food delicious,I always get this bowl thing,The chips are always SUPER fresh ,not gourmet delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Actions like this prove Chipotle cares about their customers as much as they care about the food they serve,When I came in for my usual burrito,So Corey behind the counter comped me a free burrito if I waited for fresh,I was told that they were out of chicken, chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All of the ingredients are super fresh and the food itself is very tasty,My go-to is a salad which is basically a burrito bowl without the rice (makes me feel a little,I know chipotle has had a rough,affordable and delicious you seriously can't go wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I found a TWO strands of hair in my burrito,I love chipotle-- ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husbands bowl with beef in it had large,the first set of chips were really stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So good my Chipotle burrito bowl,chips,fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was cold,By the way don't order avocado on your taco unless you want to pay like $4 bucks for it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is not really much I can add to describe the food,It was not that bad of food this time ,There's many terrific Mexican options around Columbus so it's easy to find something better than shitty food or service ,I had the burrito with black,The burritos are like $6 or $7,The burritos,They are also inconsistent about the amount they put in your burrito,beans,They also now charge about $2 for guacamole which is bullshit,The best thing is that they are fast and there is no extra charge for most ingredients,It tasted the same,It's a step above Taco Bell in taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stale chips,Lettuce in my guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is not much,and good people watching on both sides (it's on a corner),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very consistently tasty food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get that Chipotle offers more food than any person should consume in one sitting ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle has great quality food ,It took over 25 minutes to get my food ,I just couldn't take my food with me that way,There was a young lady that was making the second half of the bowls,She spilled some hot salsa sauce all over the counter and on the side of my bowl,She ignored this mishap and began to put a lid on my bowl,As she's placing the lid on my bowl the salsa was all over my lid,I kindly asked if I could have another lid because of the slop all over my bowl spilling over the side ,She almost threw my bowl ,At this time her hands had the wet sloppy salsa all over her h,She grabbed a paper towel and wiped the lid smearing salsa all over the lid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the food area,Then the food,Took my food home ,slammed into the bowl,Add in the fact that the bowl's were closed with dirty gloves ,most stale chips in the whole,cheese everywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's the way food should be,and grabbed the crunchy corn taco shells,I had some really delicious tacos ,Next they changed the serving spoons for the beans (,but if the beans themselves were already cross-contaminated,growth hormone-free meat to serve,and their guacamole is really good,since they carried both crunchy and soft corn tortillas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the food is okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and haven't stopped burrito-ing since,quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this chipotle wasn't too bad,but uneven portions of rice to chicken/steak,the chips were very stale,and when we exchanged the bag for another bag of chips hoping that that bag was the only,but hopefully they will learn from their mistakes because I won't be coming back for stale chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I use the mobile app to place my order and the food is always ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I will never be back & will start examining my food from anywhere before I start eating,I just found a huge winged insect in my Chipotle barbacoa salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The prices aren't bad,all the ingredients are fresh,healthy and consistently of good quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I hate that the chicken tastes like it was marinated in dirt,20 for chips,I hate that they don't have cheese dip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Haven't thought of chipotle in years because of the news ,and I don't eat all the ingredients now I remember why ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and using new spoons when I let them know of my food allergy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overall the food service is trash,all they have is bad attitude and a rude demeanor simple tasks such as can i have fresh sour cream they scoff at,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you want tacos or a burrito,I hadn't been into Chipotle's for a while and after being denied entry to the store I was there for due to timing I decided to stop in for a tacos ,I wanted tacos ,Three tacos ,salsa,chips,I wanted fresh meat,cheese,and lettuce,I wanted soft corn tortillas ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still fast service but that doesn't make up for their shitty food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Friendly staff and had a good flow to it- food was hot, and tasted pretty fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you don't care about being shorted on rice then call in an order from your car ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thebowl with rice pulled pork beans corn etc wasnt bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle is a great place if you want fast  Mexican and you care about sustainability and food origin,it's chain food,What's more- the food is not only always super,especially if you care where the food comes from,it's not as good as some of the boutique burrito places in town,I usually get the hard-shell tacos with carnitas , All of their meat is naturally raised ,and barbacoa and my wife will opt for the salad with guac on the side,they use fresh local and seasonal ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and I believe if you get a veggie bowl,your guacamole is FREE (correct if I'm wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's very fresh and tastes different from any other 'fast' food you would get,As far as burrito chains go this is absolutely my favorite,I always get the burrito bowl ,but watch out for the hot salsa,I do wish they'd give you chips for free,and their steak is very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was food left on every table ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1) I hate burritos,ALWAYS) go with the carnitas crispy tacos,I'm also really in love with the rice,as opposed to other Chipotles that try to give you rice in one of those teeny, salsa cups,quality ingredients,most Chipotles have the same excellent ingredients,I love Chipotle for their delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And given that rice is such a huge part of the burrito experience,These chaps (and chapettes) use way too much cilantro in the rice,It looks like a 50% split between rice ,Their ingredients are awesome,but it shouldn't overwhelm the delicate taste buds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
healthy food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can get food faster at Chilis,rice,Two weeks ago I went in to pick up a pre-paid online order and had to wait 20 minutes because they didn't have white rice,When they first opened they would give you a free bowl if you had to wait on anything,Now it's common for them to be out of chicken,and steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it's pretty difficult to make a left turn BACK onto Roswell road after you've gotten your food,and always make my burrito bowl with a smile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food  is as good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is good,The girl at the register didn't ask if it was for here or to go and put food our in a bag ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which is so heartbreaking as we love the food,We walked in to pickup the food according to the time the ticket said it would be ready,This location lacks quality service ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seems like chipotle doesn't care so long as the takeout orders still keep moving along,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By far the worst chipotle I have been to,If you want chipotle ,Also Ordered double meat ,and received exactly one extra piece of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been to other Chipotles where I've had to wait 5-10 minutes for a fresh batch of food,Just went to get a double carne asada and white rice bowl at this Chipotle,I ask for white rice ,I ask when they will make some and he says they start making some fresh white rice in about 20 to 30 minutes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always decent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never had a problem here besides today Asian gentleman that works there doesn't ask what you want in bowl just puts a mound of sour,cream in and a ton of cheese without me asking ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went over the lunch hour and the service was quick and the food tasted like the usual,Why is a veggie bowl $6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people would bring in their food from Wendy's next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I found several BLACK pieces(which they said char coal) in my bowl by biting on them myself ,The manager just mentioned very mechanically that I could get a new bowl or refund ONLY IF I have a reciept,(even thought bowl was sitting on my table with whole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then when I got home one of my bowls only had beans in it ,Half way home notice the two bags of chips were missing even after I asked them that everything is here correct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They don't know how to wrap burritos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Besides the cost of the food,Person who claimed to be manager on the phone didn't seem to care I'd spent nearly as much on getting the food to me as the food itself ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my husband went to get 2 chicken burritos,a chicken and a veggie bowl,the veggie bowl had a flipping,curly hair in the beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered ahead and the food still wasn't ready,I ordered online and while the food was ready, If that is how an employee would treat a customer (one they have had no human interaction with) then what are the chances they are following proper food safety protocols,lettuce and taco shells at 6pm on a Friday,-  I love chipotle ,""" in marker on the foil bowl cover",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can get your food quicker walking in at 10:55 then someone who puts in an order online for 10:45 online at 10:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered 3 burrito bowls in one order,2 bowls belonged to my order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for a tray and the cashier barely even wiped it down while it was still dirty and still put our food on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donno if it's cuz of covid or not but i could have sworn the bowl was empty ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything was fresh and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Even the counter where you pay was filled with food,The food line was sloppy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Husband went inside to pick up food & as he was preparing to walk out an employee advised him they were out of queso,Ordered online two bowls, one with queso and a side of chips ,When he questioned that - the employee gave an extra bag of chips,I received an offer of coupons for free chips & guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle gave me severe food poisoning last,I got the chicken bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also I'd strongly argue against even using the app to order your food your better off just waiting in line,Despite all that the food is good,This is the last time I ever come to this location might never go to a chipotle ever again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The parking lot is an absolute nightmare and the portions and quality of the food varies from visit to visit,Same with the quality of the food,I have been here on night when the line stretched out the door and I had my food relatively quickly,to the point that I would drive to a different chipotle location just to avoid the parking nightmare,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The 2 stars is for the food,The way the food got into my h, That way no food will be harmed in the making of my meal, The rice on my burrito however,but the next employee had just gotten done applying cilantro on the burrito before mine,then proceeded to get cilantro fingers all up in my burrito,The burrito made it's way to the employee who was to wrap it all up,I order a hefty burrito, This burrito was a monster,that it would be fine if they double wrapped the burrito with the extra,the mound of unwrappable burrito contents was dumped half-hazardly onto the next,the tortilla and probably 1/10 of my burrito ended up in the trash, I'll keep eating your burritos,"It started off with the question ""white or brown rice","""  My answer to that  was brown rice",but next time I'm ordering the bowl, I like both beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hubby's bowl had a topping missing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Usually it's a mound of food ,and white rice,but I would have preferred more rice ,I ordered a chicken bowl with lettuce,and you have to force a lid on the bowl,The bowl I had was only filled,and chicken,mild salsa,corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm a big fan of chipotle,Let's stay consistent chipotle,and before you know it they're closing up your bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never thought I would be giving a chipotle 2 stars:/ only writing this because it's my 3rd negative,Might be the Worst chipotle location ever ,but I still love chipotle,I ordered pickup and got two bowls of 85% rice ,They must train their employees to fill the whole bowl with rice to save money lol,"and the ""double chicken"" was about half the size of a 1 normal", serving size and literally like 20 beans  also was missing my salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just got a fingernail in my food,I'm not some weirdo who goes around claiming I have fingernails in my food for free,as if no employee ever in the history of food service has ever broken protocol,I am now grossed out by both the food here ,I then took it upon myself to compare it to an uncooked grain of whole wheat rice to see if maybe that was what it was,I ordered a veggie bowl to go ,Mid-bowl,He asked what I got and I answered - a veggie bowl with chips ,told me guac wasn't included in a veggie bowl to which I answered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will not be returning to this chipotle,Was really excited to try the keto bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food quality can be hit or miss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looked like they were intentionally and methodically giving me hardly any food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 And the food is terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I put way too many topping in my burrito,making my burrito literally explode,with its tasteless meats ,and mediocre but extra guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What I usually get is a bowl with brown rice,black beans,which is a spicy tofu  substitute for meat,lettuce and guacamole,cheese,sour cream,The ingredients are fresh, and they taste amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sharing a lot with other establishments but it's good quality food at a decent, price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6/03/17--The food is good,One of the server girls gave me attitude because I didn't want the stringy lettuce in my salad,and she was inconvenienced by me wanting to wait for actual salad lettuce in the back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the WORST chipotle in columbus,get your act together chipotle,they are also the most INEFFICIENT chipotle around,I will not be coming back to chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service is quick but not always the most friendly but who cares as long as the food is accurate,The food is always good,I frequent this Chipotle pretty often as it is one of the few convenient chipotle locations in Buckhead,The chips usually always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He is disrespectful to customers and also has some of the worst quality food we've had from here,JOHNNY RIVERA is someone @chipotle should reconsider as their general,HARD rice ,and over cooked steak,"When asked why the steak was well done his reply in a smartalec tone ""that's how it came out",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband asked for carnitas and chicken,the server (tall white lady) then gave a full portion of carnitas and no chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I still had to pay full price for my bowl,"I buy only veggie bowls so the guac is my ""meat""",It comes with that type of bowl,Tiny little pile of three-corns in the middle of the bowl,My veggie bowl should be a VEGGIE bowl,My family goes here frequently as we live just around the corner,3) Certain employees are very stingy with the ingredients,it still tasted ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also didn't put on the green salsa that I requested online,This location just doesn't care to pay attention to providing a quality product,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she refused to serve customers that previously had taken food without paying, Nice having an alternative to meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She took the serving spoon as I watched in horror as the whole spoonful dropped down over the rest of my food,No one offered to redo the bowl,So I ate half a bowl tonight,"After waiting in line 15 minutes (they weren't busy) the girl adding toppings didn't understand what ""just a little sour cream"" meant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
long and curly and there is a high chance that hair can fall in the food while serving,I usually love the rice bowl,except for today when my husband's pinto beans were raw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is one of the best chipotle locations the food is always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very quick service and the food tasted delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food itself was fine,The guy gave me barely any rice ,and beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came in last week to get a chicken bowl,But I actually threw the bowl away ,when I found a piece of sharp orange plastic in my bowl,and the chicken was way over salted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were out of steak ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I work in food service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food tasted fresh,They did forget lettuce in one of my orders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 considering she is working around food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is usually very good,chips,meats,guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however management needs to make sure that staff members in the burrito making line are properly trained in rolling burritos,Paying over $11 for a burrito that is falling apart is disappointing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food prep areas,Front line staff are even leaving food prep areas to grab back stock,this location is extremely prone to food-borne,The only protein available was chicken ,Medium salsa ,and sour cream were empty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chicken bowl and my daughter a chicken burrito,This is just like any other chipotle I've ever been to,Only thing I don't like is the long waits but they can't help that everyone loves chipotle so much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just feel as though they should have some available for people like myself who dislike being suffocated by the amount of salt in their food,but today I went in and got an order of chips ,and guacamole and was astonished by the amount of salt on the chips,I have high cholesterol and feel nervous about eating these chips,I asked if I could get chips without salt ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered four burritos ,The store was not busy at all so it was a much nicer experience than the usual harried chipotle experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I and my family are vegan and so we always get sofritas burritos,I get halfway through my burrito ,in my vegetarian/vegan burrito,The other unfortunate time I was referencing was just my burrito was a little,less than half the size of the other and regular burritos,but that doesn't bother me as much as finding dead animal in my vegan burrito,I called in and got a full refund for the tainted burrito,Pulled it out of my mouth and checked with my brother (who has eaten meat more recently than I have) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll be taking my burrito business else we're for now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why is it so complicated to get a veggie burrito with no meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love how chipotle you can make your own,There chicken bowl is yummy with the white rice w cilantro,bowl,all ingredients are always fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really bummed out to find a piece of chicken in my vegetarian burrito,Haven't had meat in over 20 years ,Chips and guacamole were good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their chips are ALWAYS stale,Avoid this location like the plague unless you like playing order roulette and eating stale chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was hot,I highly recommend getting a bowl,and don't forget the chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all the pans are empty and in the background I can see a disgusting mess of food that obviously hasn't been cleaned ,This chipotle used to be the best ,and they're cutting meat RIGHT NEXT TO IT to serve,the meat didn't even looked cooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of food at this location has improved I will say that for sure,I asked for soft tacos,when it came time to put the soft tacos in foil to take them to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food really isn't that great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  No lettuce today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yesterday my burrito came out to be half the size of my boyfriend's ,Also for some reason after saying I wanted everything they ended up leaving out the lettuce,if yall want your lettuce you better ask for it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are always stingy on the guacamole and even wanted to charge me for double guacamole simply because I asked for a little more on my bowl,The chicken is especially bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we were both too emotionally drained to make any food so we walked down to this Chipotle for a quick,When we received our food,We laughed it off and were happy to take and pay for the food we ended up with ,and delicious food,we realized that my fiancé had mumbled his order and he did not end up with exactly the type of burrito he wanted (he ordered chicken ,I have been to this chipotle a million times ,and steak and he only got chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we love their food,the the food was missing guacamole as well,I offered to return all the food,made a rather large delivery order directly through the chipotle app ($60),So I email through chipotle website,I was offered chips ,and guacamole as a good faith gesture (Keep in mind it was my large queso chips ,and dip that were missing) (No refund) (Only free chips ,Used my free chips ,missing chips ,same exact order and still missing the chips ,I am out my free chips ,and guacamole),and guacamole coupon,and guacamole,and guacamole that was credited from the previous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however management needs to make sure that staff members in the burrito making line are properly trained in rolling burritos,Paying over $11 for a burrito that is falling apart is disappointing,There was the same employee on the burrito line clearly struggling to make every order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited an hour for a single burrito bowl with my wife walking inside to check it's status 5 times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fresh,I wouldn't want to go to a restaurant where no one ever went (it would make me wonder what's wrong w/ the food),My favorite is the chicken burrito bowl,That being said the website has it where you can put everything that you would order in a virtual bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got a burrito from here that was half the size of a normal,Chipotle burrito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was delivered quickly ,Order dinner from door dash tonight and my burrito was hot,I love the chips from chipotle ,and the guacamole is always fresh,and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've literally spit my food out 4 times now into my trash can at my desk,You would think the food is hot-,love chipotle,I also found a little piece of plastic inside of my bowl,I asked for extra cilantro & the man behind the counter acted as if I was being a burden by adding something else to my bowl,Not only is my steak dried out,taste like rubber & has A LOT of gristle on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  No lettuce today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is probably the worse chipotle to order online they never never never get the orders right never,chips,extra meat or guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but once you've gone well past the given time for someone's pick up order and the person is now standing in the restaurant waiting on their food- they should be a priority,employees are not supposed to simply stop preparing food because the night is ending ,a group of men repeatedly gestured their hands and faces over and around the glass food covering ,even though they were reaching over other people's food order,Good food ,Don't made until food runs out to make more,they repeatedly expressed how they were running out of things: rice,they abruptly stopped completing one of my bowls because they ran out of chicken,I returned home and one of my bowls had less than half of the ingredients requested,(side note: at one point an employee refused to close a customer's bowl because it was overly full,Then watched as the employee closed the bowl himself,This lack of preparation led to multiple people in the restaurant waiting on one of the employees to prepare chicken,meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
learn how to cut and prep the food so we get the same,Make sure you have a strong stomach and plenty of time to visit this chipotle ,Get with the rest chipotle program,chicken was cut very thick,everything in the line was out and ingredients needed to be replenish,Food quality zero, quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They skimp out on the amount of meat/chicken ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Already have earned one free burrito,I did not find this to be the case when I ordered online - ended ended up with a pretty empty bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The beans looked gross, and the lettuce was brown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Smallest burrito i have ever gotten from Chipotle,Should only need to pay half price for this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Average chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do not recommend coming to this chipotle,Customer service should be excellent at every chipotle,This chipotle has ruined my experience eating here resulting in 1 less customer,but also the person who prepared my bowl gave me attitude,When I asked my bowl to be fixed,The customer service here completely ruined my day while also ruining my bowl as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How do you run out of steak ,I suspect they have more issues besides missing ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a burrito the tortilla split open,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chipotle is always running out of guac & salsa ,and today they didn't have fajita veggies & salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It could be that they try to stuff so much food into one that it is difficult,Chipotle doesn't stand up to most of the Boston-based burrito joints,First off: the vegetarian burrito, Here's what comes in the vegetarian burrito,the vegetarian burrito comes with - you guessed it - VEGETABLES, I like my burrito to have some substance,and Chipotle just doesn't deliver that on the vegetarian burrito, I want spice on my burrito,Thirdly: The burritos are wrapped SO POORLY,so it can be difficult to manage your burrito as you bite your way down,or it could be that the burritomeisters are not properly trained in burrito-rolling,I really wanted a burrito for dinner, But the whole time I was eating the Chipotle burrito,black beans,salsa, Their salsa offerings are limited to pico de gallo,"a green salsa (""medium"")","and a red salsa (""hot"," Not even the ""hot"" salsa is hot", So you need to rely entirely on the salsa to provide the heat,guacamole,corn, Most of the ingredients are bland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sadly I was so hungry I ordered my food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The sole reason I still go to this chipotle is for the the sake of convenience,corn salsa,Tonight I found 2 avocado pits in my poorly made guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the rice is always oily,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked do a Little queso and the man put a drop on my chicken bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered the barbacoa burrito with the works ,The beans and rice were cold,and added some chips ,the chips were borderline,it really tasted like something out of my fridge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time I have visited there has been an issue with the food or staf,This chipotle is horrible,This chipotle is literally up the street from my apartment ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the worst chipotle restaurants I have ever been to,I would rather make the 15 minute drive to the chipotle in celebration to be treated with respect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The actually quality of the food is great,they've been out of chipotle vinaigrette,I've also had to wait for rice on multiple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The people who filled the orders acted like they were giving food from their own,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It's like they don't care if you're not present to quality check them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here is good,Unfortunately we have ordered chipotle several,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never get treated like this in other chipotle,no rice,What about the usual rice,no beans,beans,no cheese,cheese,no sour cream,sour cream,but when I asked for more lettuce ,I always order salad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My favorite chipotle to go to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was also shocking to see the food assembly area/station was a mess,The only saving grace to giving a 2-star rating was the food, It was delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle meals ,I think it is time to order from a different chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was not consumed as I refused delivery since the items were not as ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a steak bowl to go, Have to drive back through traffic and given a small cup of steak which was not even a spoon full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have always come to this chipotle for the past 3 years and it has been very good with accommodating my food allergies ,around 5:15) was so rude to me and seemed extremely put out when I asked her to change her gloves for my food allergy,The past view times I have gone here other than this I have had to talk poorly trained employees through the allergen protocol which never happens at other chipotles,She spent the whole time making my bowl flirting with another employee instead of helping me,and then seemed agitated with me when I did not want to wait for another employee to go grab cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 They give you a ton of food, The food is better here, The food is hot,This is by far my favorite chipotle location I have found thus far, Normally I can finish a whole bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have come to this locations many times and have always been satisfied with the food,but you really don't care about it because it is a simple process to get your food fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Commiserating with my line-mates while we watch others enjoy their food,Although their food is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bowl was not as big,This place is always busy and the quality shows it,Woburn is twice as busy and quality did not lack,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chipotle at this location is fine if you like SPICY food,I ordered a rice bowl,with chicken (to spicy) corn salsa,I think they should serve two kinds of chicken,guacamole ,and sour cream,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chicken in the chicken tacos tasted like charcoal briquettes,I couldn't taste other ingredients in the tacos because of the burnt ,and dried up chicken bits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The pinto beans were like,The chips were chewy ,the queso looked like it had a layer of film on it (like it had been sitting out for a while and never stirred) and the guacamole was brown, When  the server was scraping the bottom of the container for brown guacamole- I asked if I could get fresh,guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The server legit tried to ration me a third of a scoop of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is usually flavorful,I was compensated with a free burrito entree,Of the chipotle chains that I've tried,I love their corn and the salad bowl is usually big, and chips & guacamole so that was very much appreciated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I never complain or send food back-,3rd time in a row this has happened at this chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the worst chipotle in Columbus,Every time I've been here they just slop my bowl together,They put the beans ,and corn on so quickly and sloppy that it's filled with the juice since they don't pause for a second to strain the bean juices/ corn salsa juices out, Only gave me a pinch of cheese,I got a salad and there was MAYBE a 1/4 c of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheese or ice tea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place has all the charm of a chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I first moved here I lived north of Midtown and when to the chipotle there,That chipotle was great,Either the rice is undercooked,Our bowls were tiny,I asked for corn and the corn was basically empty and she picked up the empty corn metal container and dumped all the runny juices that just made my bowl soggy,I watched this one girl yesterday give my gf and i a combined  8 pieces of chicken,This Chipotle has two girls in particular that always short you on the meat section,Management is either telling them to short everyone with meats to save money or the employees just don't give any meats,shorted on the meat section,always gave you a reasonable amount of all the ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Frustration mounts from the size of their long lines waiting to get your food made ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food isnt,I found a piece of wood in my food ,I'm assuming as they were cutting the chicken they managed to slice a piece of wood that got mixed, in with the meat, consistent in quality or quantity,Sour cream was watery and tasted off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why do their employees skimp on the meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They completely forgot about my quesadilla (burnt to shit) and they forgot which burrito was mine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was wraps for burritos,They gave me someone else's bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually ordered the chicken with brown rice,beans,See the staffs grinding it out  cooking the meat ,guacamole lettuce ,and corns ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Slowest chipotle I have ever been to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they put cheese on my fuckin doordash order and im allergic and my night is ruined fuck u chipotle employyee ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food great,Wilted lettuce for salad bowl and room temp burrito bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food ordered was placed around 9:20 pm tonight,but my food was never made for my Postmates driver to bring me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All set with the Burlington chipotle it's literally the worst one around at this point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they did run out of white rice with about a 20 minute wait on the night I visited,because I wanted brown rice anyway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got tacos ,and I kid you not there's 4 chunks of chicken on each taco,Chipotle is stingy asf with their chicken like it's literally ridiculous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
watery food,It's been a long time since I've been able to enjoy a good chipotle meal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took 25 minutes for a burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love this chipotle,Other than that rude person this is the best chipotle to go to,They always give me extra rice ,While a girl with blonder hair and a septum piercing looked at my bowl I told her nicely since I like to talk to people that it was a carnitas,bowl because she started at it for a while with a market in her hand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
friendly staff and good food,I seriously can eat chipotle everrryyydddaaayyy,I love watching the guys in the back cook the chicken on the grill,From the salad to the meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I waited and watched two full queued lines of people walk in and order and receive their food,I ordered a chicken bowl with all the fixings ,Instead I got a chicken bowl salad with sour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The prep counter is always cover in food or some sort of liquid,The employees never clean the counter before starting food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is st,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the worst chipotle,ridiculously over-salted rice,frozen corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 No chicken on chicken tacos ,and no chicken in a chicken quesadilla,no drink for my toddler and no chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered my classic burrito bowl ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Just substandard food, Stuffed with rice ,but very little meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had the bowl with chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meanwhile half of the food was missing from the serving bar,were still mixing rice,it was apparent the counter had not been wiped down the night before as there were random chips laying on it,They had no steak,and smears of sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if i could give this chipotle negative,i've ordered from this chipotle multiple,do NOT EVER order from this chipotle,and this is an experience that i've had multiple times only with this chipotle,i even got chips that i did not order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Ran out of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we wanted hot salsa ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delicious food,I got a burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
normally the food good,i used to work at chipotle ,The rice was soggy,The beans seemed like it wasn't cooked fully,and the lady gave me the smallest scoop of guacamole ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I still got my food without a significant,and asked me if my food was okay,and I tried a veggie burrito bowl for the first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So me and my friend were geting dinner then heading to dave and busters and we usally eat at chipotle on hilliard,rome and that chipotle is the best ,and i am very known at that chipotle because i always go there so often,So as i said went to this one by dave and busters and it was terrible there tomatoes was very terrible and i waited 30 min for steak and got steak free but still i was running late to and the working working in the kitten was being terrible and was saying i dont eat chipotle were terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am not one to complain and I have worked several years in the food business,"The girl making my food keep saying ""what else"" what else"" with an extremly",The reason I write to you is because like I said I have worked in the food industry for 8+ years ,Qdoba is a quarter mile away and the staff is amazing there and actually fill the burrito bowls I have not ONE complaint about Qdoba ,About 5 times or so a month I like to get take out from Chipotle or Qdoba in Saugus both are very close to eachother but Chipotle has brown rice so I like to go there for that reason,They had already threw the brown rice out ,She did not put in the lettece or guacamole that I aksed for ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
throw half your food on the counter (so you'll get 1 once of rice,she'll slam the bowl down,and 1 piece of chicken),beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only reason I am giving this location 2 stars is because 1) the cashier attendant was super nice and apologetic about the delay and 2) at least the food still tasted good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It tastes weird to begin with but as a franchise I feel it is absolutely crucial to post every ingredient as it is expected to be the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two burrito bowls is less than $17,First time at a chipotle in Atlanta,Ambiance: 10/10: as expected at any chipotle chain,Food quality: 9/10: LOVED the way they cook rice,Price: 10/10 reasonable for what you get,Conclusion: craving rice,My only suggestion is that they don't skimp on meat serving size so much,steak, or the cheese (this is my middle,cheese ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They serve cube burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quality salad though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We had it on our tacos ,and two side orders w chips,HOWEVER this locations has FAKE guacamole,This is a photo of the guacamole the next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had them at with the lime and cilantro rice,I did a bowl with a side of chips,black beans,corn salsa,and salsa verde,or maybe it was the corn salsa,the chips were saltier than usual,My friend got something similar to me but instead got chorizo for the meat,lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good healthy food , This is our never fail food stop, My favorite is the vegetarian burrito bowl, Of course their prices are great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered a chicken burrito bowl,Let me start by saying that I love chipotle,As much as I love chipotle,My bowl ended up being cold,There was a good bit of sour cream that had gone into the hot salsa,and the guacamole was super,various ingredients had made their way into the sour cream,The employees were careless with the ingredients,causing cross contamination with a lot of the ingredients,has let me down numerous times with their inconsistent quality,as the majority of it ended up in my trash can due to the poor quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not-too-salty etc & just good natural food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Went here last week and it was a cluster - as in the young man making my food literally didn't know which meat was which ,and asked me to point to it and also didn't know how to fold a soft taco so he had to get the manager to name two quick,but he literally had to ask a manager to help fold the soft tacos,I couldn't wait to tell people my follow up story from the first visit where the guy didn't know how to fold a soft taco at Chipotle,He also started off with the wrong meat ,1 miles) and the meat was almost refrigerator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always tell people I love chipotle more than the authentic food there lol,Order a tortilla inside of a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chicken was as bland as hospital food,The rice was like paste ,We pulled into the parking lot to open to bowls to make sure,she didn't bring the chips so again,We got home to eat our usual favorites and they all tasted bland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I normally don't go to chipotle since I have moved to Colorado with all the amazing,First chipotle location where I don't feel like I got ripped on on the meat scoop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I prefer to watch my burrito being built because ,Portion control is inferior and what's up with scooping up the beef and chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While I enjoy Chipotle food,especially their chicken burrito bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Would rather drive 30 mins to the chipotle in Alpharetta than go to this dump,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle so much,There's chipotle is not very consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
proceeded to look for a marker left the front line and looked for a marker came back didn't change her gloves after searching for a marker proceeded to use the new marker on the food ,The employee never changed her gloves and did a serious of cross contamination on the food,She then proceeded to take another order put meat on a bowl set the bowl down then noticed she didn't need the meat ,and tossed the meat back into the bowl with the other, meat,She then used that same meat to make another order ,I notice one of the employees drop the permanent black marker into the cheese dip,the next order requires cheese dip which she USED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Started to clean slowly and even though people were waiting with their warm food to sit at a clean,Hasn't Chipotle had many problems in the past regarding food safety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
today in my online-order chicken bowl I had to really dig in to find any existence of chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and dirty :/ I love chipotle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to see you grab ur boxers then my food,Instead of a burrito you end up with a soggy,""" Who in their right mind wants a double wrapped burrito",had a burrito at chipotle with out something wrong,It seems like every chipotle only hires morons,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wasn't a long line like you'll find at most chipotles these days,Food tasted fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle I've ever been to,"For someone who's a vegetarian the veggies are the ""meat"" of the meal",but this doesn't excuse the poor quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
especially after eating contaminated food,The final nail in the coffin was when I got a nasty stomach bug after eating a chicken bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was hot,We ordered a burrito with double,Probably one of the best chipotles I've been to since this chain restaurant started,Usually you get shafted by the price , chicken and a regular chicken bowl,They did right by the customer and added the perfect amount of meat to compliment the meal,cooked well and tasted great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No one wants to eat crunchy rice ,and brown guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the food is always cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And it is not necessarily for the food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
including a dozen in corner waiting for pickup orders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You're lucky if you even get a teaspoon of meat in your burrito,Still just a tiny little bit of meat hiding within a ton of rice ,and beans,80 for double meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually don't act as the food police,EXTRA rice,And that's barely a regular serving of rice,much less extra rice,I placed an order for a bowl with regular, chicken,light salsa,This same location has also repeatedly given me the wrong size of chips/queso before,and EXTRA cheese,Never mind the extra cheese,there's no cheese at all,I recognize that sometimes you may run out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you would think you are the in the prison food line,There is absolutely no excuse for food bits to be flying around ,and splattered all over around the food trays,I don't need bits of scrapped Trey material in my food,I understand since this is probably the only chipotle in Gr,andview area every single 20 something-year-old hits this place at some point of the day so the line is always stretching out to the door which is good news for chipotle ,but I don't understand the rudeness and the way some of them slap the toppings on the bowl ,Can you please not scrap the very last bit of the fajita then pass the bowl,That poor salsa verde hasn't done anything to you to beat it like that,Be gentle on splashing the heck out of that sour cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5 miles away to the chipotle on perimeter center to get my food,My husband stated that nearly half of his burrito didn't even have meat in it,Out of guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Normally good food here,Used the mobile order app to get food quickly,After standing there for 20 mins someone walks up to me and told me that they were out of three different types of meat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were out of white rice (with a wait of 29 minutes to make more),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's fresh and the food is pretty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always out of ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ive ordered online and when i arrive the food is not done ,and i am left waiting 20-30 mins past the time the food should have been ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food is basically the same,( The processness of the process food really shines through in comparision to local, Last thing we want is a host of Chipotle Nazis lashing us on trying to break the land speed record in the phony burrito division,I had the chicken burrito, I am not a fan of their chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rice,beans,guacamole,always out of at least 1-2 staple items (cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've had some bad chipotle experiences ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food was cold,chips were waaay to salty,and the darn chips were stale,missing lettuce not sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rude and make sloppy bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had ordered a huge burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when I got home I discovered one of the 2 bowls was wrong,but the chips were stale, -- tasted like someone had opened teh bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not-too-salty etc & just good natural food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always burns the meats and have found hair in food a few,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First there was no rice in a burrito bowl,I have ordered from this chipotle 3 times in the past,I have never had an issue with chipotle before,then missing toppings and finally I ordered a salad and the bowl was less than half full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It doesn't appear they are following recipes as the food does not have the same, They give a huge amount of rice with a teaspoon amount of the other,beans, items (salsa,cheese, taste as other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My friend had the burrito bowl ,are you really charging me for chips and lackluster salsa,She enjoys the free chips and the abundance of salsa choices,meats,Who wants to eat at a dirty table with meat particles left all over it,delicious meats,the guacamole was obviously made with less than ripe,avocados and I am assured that McDonalds would have better guacamole than this Chipotle,McDonald's doesn't sell guacamole as their hot,cheeses,you don't have cheese dip,and cheeses are if you can't produce cheese,and get in my belly cheeses,The lettuce looked like it had been sitting out for days--,delicious ,it tasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Someone complained because they couldn't see the food they were ordering because it was pulled back about 4 feet from the window,Even though the burrito was undersized,The experience I had at this chipotle,unlike any other chipotle I've been to,I asked for some tobacco to compensate because the only ones out were the chipotle ,Don't go to this chipotle,chicken ,and and corn containers were all close,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the quality of the food is always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Mexican food,let alone eat their food,I was going to be crushing burritos on the daily,Grow up and learn to roll a burrito,I attribute this to the fact that a bunch of pissed off teenagers are the ones making my chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still i was charged and it didn't let me cancel the order I know it was through Uber eats but still how In the world it takes 2 hours to prepare a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she gave literally the smallest portion sizes i've ever received and it was just not what i'd expect of chipotle,fajita veggies and 2 meats,they were out of cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you are looking for the traditional chipotle customer service you might as well go somewhere else,This particular chipotle has the WORSE IDIOTS working,My chicken was uncooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just found a hair in my tacos and my husband's chicken burrito came without any chicken,This continues to be the worst chipotle experience time after time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hope you lost business and I'll be in to give you a price oft,It's few ingredients in assembly line ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good chipotle experience,cheese,"This one girl said ""sour cream","lettuce """,Sometimes you get ingredients that have been sitting out awhile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also the last 3 times I've gone here I've gotten food poisoning ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the floor was stacked with dropped food ,Just brushed the food onto the floor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Disclaimer that I can't rate the food because I never got that far,I also watched them throw my food away in front of me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But you can visit any Chipotle location and know exactly how your food is going to taste,If it was based solely on the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Run don't walk to the nearest real food place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They used to load up your burrito,I'm sorry but I expect a large burrito ,as well as only fill your salsa up halfway,they short you on chips now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always love chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yummy burritos but gave me food poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is by far the worst Chipotle Mexican grill I have ever visited I often go to Chipotle because I'm vegan and it is my go-to place but in this particular store I witness employees wiping dirty food into full,bins of food there's no food h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always get my food quick ,and steak often has fatty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The flavors were all there and we had so much food we ate plentiful, Made a bowl for myself and a burrito for my hubby, My spouses burrito looked ,This is probably one of the BEST chipotles I've gone to in a while,This was not the average bowl, Usually at the Miami locations they barely put any ingredients in the bowl,My bowl was FULL ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I tried this Chipotle a few weeks ago I actually went in to the restaurant and it was trash I said let me give them another shot it's a different time a different crew maybe it won't be so sloppy and maybe this shift will care about how they prepare the food ,because you shouldn't put four bowls and a burrito in one bag ,and to top it off the burrito wasn't fully wrapped it was open, and I ordered two orders of guacamole and chips didn't receive my chip to my order and all of the bowls were made sloppy, Well that didn't happen my extra cheese ,and extra sour cream was not added,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chipotle has been my go to for cheap and quick ""Mexican"" food for a while",Tasty and local sources (when possible) ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Counters just covers in food bits everywhere ,and the amount of food on the floor was appalling,When I got my food it was OK,People in the kitchen area were busy cutting up meats and making rice,I had many pieces of chicken that had big,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were pretty busy when we were there but they got us our food pretty quickly,The ingredients in my bowl tasted very fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They even had the food in the back,area with no tops on the food because they were busy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,Ability to order online and pick up the food without waiting in the long,Limited choices on menu: burrito,tacos,bowls,and chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service is friendly and the food is made well,The first time I came I got a burrito ,and the second time I came I got a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Salad Bowls with chicken are $7,25 to add guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight I went in for a burrito bowl with chicken,I asked for extra chicken ,we are trying to stretch the chicken until closing time,"The service there isn't always great and tonight I was in disbelief that they were really ""stretching ""chicken",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I still can try to get my burrito to taste like a real,rice,I tried asking them to exchange my beans for some extra, I can understand that- it's not a 'fair exchange' this beans for steak business,and some salsa, meat- no can do,and a little bit of super rubbery 'steak' here ,So I eat mouthfuls of lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I then asked for a side of dressing and she just basically threw it and it fell on the floor and she didn't even try and apologize or pick it up so I grabbed my split open dressing and sat and ate my food,I got a chicken burrito ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just received an order delivered thru DoorDash and my food was cold,Not only was the food cold,What little I did consume of the food didn't taste right,but the guacamole that I paid extra for was left off of both of my bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If someone orders a salad there should be lettuce in the bowl not a pile of rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it always pays off to be nice to people brave enough to work the food industry,A big atta girl to you & just know you are appreciated & a bright spot at this chipotle location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took 45 minutes at 330 to get our food,Literally the WORST chipotle I have ever been to in my life,when I asked for sour cream I asked why it looked so weird,""" Like can I have some UNFROZEN sour cream please",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go to chipotle at least twice a week,If you ask for extra rice at any other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is amazing,chicken,beans,The beans are warm,Although they sometimes run out of stuff like guacamole and chips,The chips are very,cheese,with extra lettuce,corn,and the corn refreshing,Lately I have been getting a salad,and tastes good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cook your food,Went to take a fork full of my bowl and but into hard rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Server gives  smaller than usual servings of meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Saturday night I came into Chipotle and ordered a burrito,There was a young and very sweet employee who let me know my burrito was only the second,I was debating between a bowl and a burrito so I would have been pleased either way ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Need better quality control at this location ASAP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's pretty crappy getting all the way home and not having the food you paid EXTRA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Apparently the people working on 1/17/2020 at 2 pm can't read because we ordered 2 burrito bowls ,very clearly the employees don't give a crap about quality or customer care,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst chipotle ever,The rice was sticking in chunks,My bowl looked sad, with a bunch of steak and beans ,barely any salsa,and a hint of salsa,no guacamole, The steak was dry,no lettuce,no corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a burrito with black,Cons: burrito completely fell apart,Plus they all had rice,rice is flavorful,We ordered 2 bowls with black, beans and chicken,chicken,chicken had great, beans,and corn salsa,corn salsa was obviously frozen,we had to get chips ,chips were stale (which affected our queso,and cheese or sour, or canned corn,the queso had a strange after taste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is left out for too long,This place is by far the worst chipotle,Not only is the quality mediocre,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was delicious,The restaurant is located in a central location and the building is fairly spacious for a chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We just got our take out food ,and the bowls were less than half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have also run into a similar issue here in the past with the ratio of ingredients in the  burrito bowls,I would just recommend working or ratios in the burrito bowls,My friend got a bowl from here recently ,when one item is a higher quantity than the rest it ruins the bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most chipotles in Orlando are known for quick service and this one needs new staffing --food was fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The amount of food they served me was preposterous,Who knows what they're putting in the food,I've never seen such a skimpy burrito bowl in my life,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are out of food,"""we are out of white rice ",At 9:51pm they now have chicken and white rice,and chicken,and steak she tells her counter,"the employees begins serving the line again and notices she is out of quac,corn",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and beans,Two hours before closing out of guacamole,cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got 2 bowls and a burrito,the bowl was pretty much half full and the burrito was a baby size,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I finally got my order I looked in my bag and saw that the label on my burrito bowl was correct,They'd given me the wrong beans ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When it comes to the food,One of the most inconsistent food items available,excellent food here,This makes for a very frustrating time trying to get your burrito fix,these are my favorite part of my bowl,The steak has also been consistently free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zero stars the overloaded my bowl with 90% rice no room left for any thing else ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We download the app while parked and ordered our food ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good food,Love love chipotle here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is Robert boure E and I endorse this message the food was warm,the people are clean they just very very nice when I first walked in there and felt great I'm even saying it now too can't wait to have some good food the food was so so so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The quality of food is poor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chips were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the staff are nice and the food is good,and picking your food up to-go,This chipotle is always so dirty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always great,I love this chipotle for many,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food itself looked like it had sat in the trays all day ,and tasted awful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now the food,So there goes all our food all over the floor , Does she offer to replace our food,So we brought the food home to eat,My kids cheese dip is missing and my food is so spicy,  This is not even close to what I could call a chipotle customer service quality,only the nice chipotle lady ask what happen , it was non enjoyable or Chipotle's quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I forgot her name I think it's Hellen she was such a sweet heart she made my chipotle experience so much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I gave him a list of foods that I would like in my steak bowl,I can't take my food back because not only is my car now in the shop getting worked on,Once my bowl arrived to where I work,there was no steak in my bowl,but no steak inside my bowl,I got charged for the steak,I decided to try them again and I got no steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's not often you can confidently walk into a Chipotle and feel your food will be good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We had the chicken fajita burrito ,and steak burrito, The burritos are huge, Both our votes go to the chicken fajita as the better of the two meals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it is worsened by their running out of ingredients during the lunch rush,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I primarily go to chipotle for the salad dressing,I was bummed out about the dressing not being available so i typically don't eat chipotle wi,Not only did she throw my chipotle order out in the trash,This will deter me away from ever going to this chipotle location again (right,I had ordered two bowls so i,told her i would only like one bowl due,threw out the bowl in my face (aggressively throwing it into the trash) ,I asked for the salad dressing to complete my order ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle ,but this is the slowest chipotle in the history of mankind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food quality seems great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I go in one time and they have ONE person making food ,I'm never buying chipotle from this location again,I've never been to a chipotle that has like TWO GOD DAMN people in it AT A TIME,I go today asking for a bowl with Brown Rice,It is the most pathetic ass lookin bowl ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the rice (I got brown,rice),chicken bowl with the fixin's ,the chips have been stale,and chips,I also ordered a large chips,I got back to my work to discover he had given me a regular size chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 the food at chipotle's literally insulted,I shouldn't have to be dragged all the way to Fenway just to eat disgusting dog food slathered in baby puke wrapped in a wrinkly , my taste buds with their disgusting crap and tasteless excuse for burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked the gentleman why our food was so skimpy,I thought I had experienced the worst chipotle until I came to this one,My bowl was less than half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love that you can see the employees cooking the food right in front of you,Great vegetarian options and the food is always good,This chipotle is always very clean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I haven't had my Chipotle app order missed up or eaten undercooked rice once,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the quality of the food that you're likely,here's the thing (and this is like THE THING): there was no one in the front kitchen cooking or preparing food,but I took the food home,As I pulled up the store (I was really craving a burrito bowl),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bit of a small location with about seating for 30 to 40 ppl including patio seating and while the food looks extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm just annoyed because now I know why my online orders are garbage and I shouldn't have to thoroughly watch employees to make sure I'm getting the food I'm paying for,I had to ask the girl for more rice twice,and I had to ask for more of every ingredient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they had my food ready,The burrito bowls I ordered were packed,Minus one star because the chips were pretty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually come just for a side of rice , I really love the cilantro lime laced rice ,and / or beans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My wife and I have eaten at Chipotle from Ohio to Maine and always had good food,The bowl simply did not taste as good,Noted was very dried out beans,The green salsa was very bitter,Stale chips,steak,CHICKEN was mixed in with my steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I counted 18 mobile orders cut to the front of the line to get their food because pickup is BEHIND the counter,because they want their food now,By far the worst setup of a chipotle,It's located on a busy corner ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food taste fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She offered me hot sauce on my food ,I repeated that is little hot sauce for my food they kept saying No that that is Salsa,cashier said that is Salsa comes with chips ,Wondering who eats hot sauce with chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm normally a huge chipotle fan,They get away with poor service and do not use the same ingredients in their rice as any other chipotle because it is in a good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They take their time and your food is cold by the time it gets to the register,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even though there's an employee right in front of me in the main line where they had all the ingredients out ready to make burritos ,and bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is typically fresh,I typically get the food delivered to my work place,My only quarrel is how much it cost to get the food delivered but,I guess that is the price you pay for not wanting to walk/drive over there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zero stars the overloaded my bowl with 90% rice no room left for any thing else ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is quite possibly the worst chipotle on the planet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I asked for a wrap on the side and the same guy threw it onto the counter next to my wife's food as my bowl was being finished,My wife said her food was bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love chipotle just as much,Found an alive & crawling bug in my bowl today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This last visit I ordered a burrito ,and tacos,After getting home I realize they never put the tacos in my bag,I drive back and ask them for my tacos,"so you're the one that left your tacos""","Thinking in my head ""no that was you""  while he hands me the cold tacos sitting off to the side with no apology",I ask for guacamole ,and they tell be there out and I can wait 10-15 minutes if I want for them to make more guacamole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The girl who made our food rushed us,My brother got a burrito,He needed to use a fork to eat his burrito,but this is definitely the worst chipotle I've been to,Didn't even bother asking my brother if he wants rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
horrible bowl of garbage I have ever seen, The dinner was probably dropped as the bowl ,and cover were all smashed - when I opened the smashed bowl all that was in there was not recognizable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the burritos have been noticeably small,the rice has been undercooked,I always order through the app and ask for extra rice ,and extra cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it made the food inedible,but the burritos have been noticeab small,the rice has been undercooked,I always order through the app and ask for extra rice ,Edit: I tried the restaurant again and the meat was the texture of jerky ,and extra cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yet their quality ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and rip-off of a burrito,They skimp on the ingredients because they don't want to run out ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I had to ask the person completing my order to always stir the food as it was dry, I would think someone in the food industry would underst,I have been to chipotle's before,the rice was dry,the chicken was dry, The beans were dry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I received a prompt response and commitment of a free guacamole coupon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Might as well throw in that this location gives you half the amount of food as the others,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They say no mask no service here however their cooks wear their masks below their nose breathing all over the food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Avoid this chipotle at all costs,they're always out of something (brown rice,corn salsa,no guacamole,guacamole),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll miss your bowls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Chipotle has always been very considerate of those with food allergies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All I wanted was bowl of good chipotle ,Worst place to get chipotle delivered,They barely put any meat or rice,Left over lettuce the nasty,And barely lettuce while I was eating it big,bottom part of lettuce came out it doesn't even look like it was washed lettuce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was missing rice,Last week my Diet Coke tasted like Clorox bleach,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We received our food within the promised, The food was still warm,we enjoyed the food,"I had the ""build your own"" burrito bowl ","and hubby had the ""build your own"" burrito",My only complaint is that my burrito bowl looked a bit small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and lettuce from my order although it was written on the sticker they place on your food,Additionally found a hair in the rice of my burrito,The burrito was about 1/2 the size it usually is at Chipotle,salsa,corn salsa,Left of the requested cheese,corn ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service and food here is pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This use to be my favorite chipotle ,They are only taking online orders for one so if you don't have the chipotle app then you are out of luck,Secondly I ordered two chicken bowls with fajitas ,and BOTH bowls are missing fajitas,Secondly both bowls are ice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A burrito should be all about balance ,and you have to watch that they don't put 70% rice, If there was half as much chicken as rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I never thought to check reviews for a chipotle before,The last straw for me today was ordering a sofritas bowl that was filled with chicken ,The bowl was overfilled too ,and steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I absolutely love chipotle salads,When I got up to the register I opted to add chips (after all we'd been working hard,On my most recent visit (it had sadly been months) I was even more excited for my salad than usual,It wasn't until I had secured a seat at an outdoor table with the hot sauces lined up just so that I realized that the best part was missing - the salad dressing (the recipe used to be a bit better ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food was very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which causes additional slowdown as people wait for the food to be cooked,the food itself tastes the same,They also are often out of ingredients (usually the fajita,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolute best chipotle,they always give a good amount (not like some other chipotles who don't give you anything) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So the food here is pretty good,I know it's annoying when customers ask for their burrito to be mixed,I asked today and the lady kind of smirked squeezed the sides of the burrito together ,not the best chipotle I've ever had ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So as the man is making my burrito,I was charged for a burrito with extra,The man put a very small amount of chicken in my burrito,"""I don't think that's my regular price"" (I go to Chipotles all over frequently ",he literally puts a TINY amount of chicken on it,so I asked for a LITTLE more chicken, chicken,I said I didn't get a full size extra of chicken,chicken was not fully cooked,I don't get beans,I had a free meal reward and I didn't realize that guacamole was not included,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just to get to ordering to find out they were basically out of everything but chicken,guac & cheese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They consistently cross contaminate my family's food,and chipotle has good,This has not happened at other chipotle locations,My sisters bowl regularly ends up with cheese or tomatoes in it,my guacamole had heaps of cheese in it today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another lady was waiting outside with me and when a manager brought her food out she let him know that she was given major,The food was cold by the time I got home,and by far the longest I've waited for an online order at chipotle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The only reason I'm posting this is because the lime rice was very undercooked, Please taste the rice before you serve it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Each layer of food has a really great,All around dedication to quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food here was absolutely delicious,I ended up getting the chicken burrito bowl,There's maybe like two rows for parking at chipotle ,They had stuff to the bowl so I had more than enough,I also got the chips and salsa,The salsa had a spicy tangy taste to it which made it that much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered 2 bowls one with extra, chicken an another with extra, steak neither one had extra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i order my burrito,they don't listen and i ask them to remove some of the rice - after she rolled her eyes and remade my burrito,she put about a teaspoon of rice on the new burrito,this was absolutely the worst experience i've ever had at any chipotle location,there is a large parking area behind to park in - rest assured that you can only park on the first row (of 6 other rows) for chipotle parking,ask for very little rice,the same thing happened with the woman who added the cheese,I asked for extra cheese ,and she rolled her eyes and put only a tiny bit more cheese,i ask for a side of shredded cheese without any attitude,the same woman who gave me attitude with my cheese ROLLS HER EYES ,and puts another pinch of cheese in a cup for me - purposefully does not fill it up at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but actually picking up your food is really difficult,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1 person in front of me in line and still took me like 3 minutes to get my burrito done because only one employee was making burritos,Person didn't know how to wrap burritos so she had to redo it ,Found some burnt beyond recognition piece of something in my burrito,Definitely one of the worse chipotles I've been to, Brown rice was out of stock,and lost some ingredients doing so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered tacos ,and chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and tasty burrito just the way I want it,I eat my burrito in peace,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the person making my food is having personal,conversations ( sometimes on the phone) with their friends and completely ignoring me while putting things in my food I didn't ask for,he rolled his eyes and gave me an attitude the rest of the time he was making my food,The dirtiest chipotle I've ever been to,Almost every time I've been to this chipotle,I rather drive an extra half hour to the next nearest chipotle then over go to the saugus one,I am a vegetarian and once one of the employees put chicken on my bowl w out asking,He continued by grabbing a plastic cup and SCOOPING the chicken out of my bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also please reference the review that mentions actual LARVAE in their food,the workers & the food are absolutely sub,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the burritos were cold,"My ""large guac and chips"" was a leaking",no chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I frequent this location because it is close to where I live but I have had two instances where the rice was so undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You'll hit another chipotle or chipotle equivalent,Always low on guacamole or fajitas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The restaurant is always dirty and there isn't a single person working who seems like they care at all about the quality if the food or the customer experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the food was fresh,Best Hilliard chipotle h, and delicious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This food is by far the freshest in all the chipotle's in the Hilliard area,Definitely one of my favorite chipotles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My friend got a chicken burrito ,His burrito was huge,I asked for extra salsa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typical chipotle - always busy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service was quick but the food is bleh,And the chips were stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is what happens when you order right outside and then one second later right after you order you walk in and you say hey can I have no cilantro in my rice can I substitute my rice Even though they don't have an option for you to do that on the online ordering ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get a salad bowl with chicken,black beans,corn salsa,and guacamole,a lot of cheese,put lettuce on top so the guac doesn't stick to the lid,It's delicious,It tastes like broccoli cheddar soup from Panera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the tables are full of the staffs food ,Every time I go there they mess up on something and sometimes I'll ask for a quesadilla for my brother and in the app I'll tell them it's a quesadilla and they make it into a burrito every time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I alway get extra of everything and a double wrapped burrito ,the best chipotle I have ever had,we were in an out and had some good a$$ chipotle to eat,I wish i could tell all the chipotles in my town to be more like this location,and the chipolte in my town can never seem to get my order right and they're rice is always under cooked,but this locations rice was cooked perfectly,everything was hot and fresh and tasted so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rice was also PLAIN WHITE RICE (no lime or cilantro),they were out of corn salad ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My food arrived,sealed and when I opened the guacamole looks great,Yup it is listed in the salad container ,He said we can't credit you because you aren't charged for dressing its included in your salad,I said I don't want a credit I want dressing for my salad,expensive fast casual salad i paid delivery for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didn't get my large queso and I literally got THREE bags of stale chips,I cannot believe someone would even serve those chips,(Btw all I got were chips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd like to say that I love chipotle ,this specific chipotle is bar none one of the most inconsistent,The portion control is laughable and on multiple occasions the rice ,and chips have been undercooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All city chipotles do,This one is particularly bad because my bowl was about a quarter full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't add meat so it means a lot that the pico is not watery,I saw she was to the bottom of pico and literally scrapping just to have enough for my salad,I was driving 10-15 mins to the South Buckhead location because the quality is better ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a pork burrito bowl,received a cold container of steak and half a bag of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Response after emailing pictures and several phone calls to corporate was to send coupons for 3 free burritos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they sent us an extra guacamole with a sweet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food wasn't all that great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NO excuse for how dirty it was or a reason to not have fresh ingredients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This restaurant needs to be shut down due to COVID-19 because they use their hands to pick up the lettuce,You're putting the plastic gloves on the counter and then you picking up the salads with your h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's been awhile and I wanted to try the barbacoa burrito ,The burrito was not wrapped well ,and I had a wet mess on my hands as they did not drain the beans properly into the burrito Disappointing,the quality seems to have drifted down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Did a online pick up order and forgot our multiple bags of chips that we had paid for ,"When we got inside of the place they said ""I don't know if we have any chips","and if we do they are going to be skimpy bags of chips"" ",and once we had opened the chips at home it looks like they split one bag of chips among 3 bags,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The burrito ,and bowl were very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This restaurant always has a nice greeting at the door and very friendly and the food is prepared as it should be with portions (they kindly add more of you ask them) ,This OTHER Chipotle I had to get food at in the next,cross contamination of food,Thanks for creating good customer service and caring about the food you serve,) so I decided to go to another chipotle, town over made me really appreciate the chipotle I had been accustomed to for the past,Because HOLY SHIT this other chipotle,I left that other chipotle at the next,I wouldn't even eat at chipotle period,there was hellllaaa sour cream in one of the sauces bc of carelessness with h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Came to this location 45 minutes before closing and they were out of white rice,Stood and waited for 15 minutes and can clearly see them make and season the white rice,only to be called back up to the counter and informed that they don't have any white rice,Even saw them mix brown and white rice together in an order,probably to make up for the lack of white rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have had chipotle in awhile ,The first time the employees at Chipotle put someone else's bowl in my bag so DoorDash would have had no clue it was wrong,still had to pay deliver and tip for second order) so I tried to call the store to make sure they get the right order in the bag and they know someone else will be missing their bowl , So I finally get my bowl,They also can't tell the difference between chicken ,I only ordered chicken,and steak ,says my name on it but they put sour cream on it ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delicious food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered a bowl with a new,steak product,They have steak labeled 8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Tonight they're out of chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then when I take the food back because it was wrong,We all work way too hard to be jipped on over $80 worth of food for my family,chips old, and super small portions for double meat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The food was good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I get it's covid and they are busy but this is the third time going to this chipotle where I had to order online ,I ordered a large queso and the container wasn't even filled halfway and my bowl maybe had 4 str,ands of lettuce on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First time I've ever finished a chipotle taco normally not a fan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the food was everything mixed,"ok only thing i cand say ""worst chipotle ever i","try"" i order by chipotle app ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To my dismay when i opened my burrito it was cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cook was wearing a mask but it was not covering his nose and his face was very close to the food he was cooking,The line server marked our burritos incorrectly ,The chips were so stale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but in my search to find a replacement for those lunchtime taco and burrito cravings,And while I ate my burrito from tonight's visit moments after purchasing,The tacos I had were decent,limed rice,Without salsa it would taste like nothing,Also the hot salsa is extremely weak,The cheese inside had not even melted ,the ingredients fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wouldn't recommend anyone to come to this place as clearly the workers do not care about their customers there was a female there who rudely answered to me personally I never experienced this in my life I was traumatized and I will never go back it's truly upsetting to see this in a restaurant chipotle is a fast run Fast food place ,but clearly it's at the clerk 15 minutes to charge me at this point my food was already code so it was pointless for me to get my food it's disappointing,when you're ready to eat and the food is cold, and on top of that you're getting an attitude I believe the worker spoke something bad about me and said it in Spanish I'm Hispanic so I listen to her and it was really rude what she commented about I also seen some chips on the table counter ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My mom and I always go to this chipotle,my mom almost swallowed this chicken bone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I hate that I have to continue giving them my business but it's the only chipotle close to my house,If you place an online order that includes chips,don't count on getting your chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My burrito literally falls apart every time,other days I just need a goddamn burrito,I can honestly say there is nothing more upsetting than craving a burrito,stop over filling the burritos,I am a hungry girl who loves nothing more than mouth harassing your burritos,and if you're reading this thinking about getting a burrito from this location do yourself a favor ,driving to chipotle,Some days I enjoy a bowl,If I wanted a bowl,I would have ordered a bowl,but now i'm stuck with a bowl because y'all can't pump the brakes with the portions,and just get a bowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The food is always fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
